8086,运动能够直接造成能量负平衡，或者通过加强食物的热量生成、加速安静代谢率和（或）减少食物摄取达到能量负平衡。,"Exercise induces negative energy balance either directly or by enhancing meal thermogenesis, increasing resting metabolic rate, and/or decreasing food intake."
8086,然而，运动本身的能量消耗很小，食物的热效应也可忽略不计。,"However, energy cost of exercise per se is minimal, and thermic effect of food is negligible."
8086,"因此，运动训练结合低卡路里饮食可能有益，因为这种结合有助于保持较高的安静代谢率和去脂肪体重（Calles-Escandon & Horton,1992）。","Exercise training may be advantageous in conjunction with a low calorie diet because it helps to maintain resting metabolic rate and fat-free mass (Calles-Escandon & Horton, 1992)."
8087,测试安静能量消耗（REE)通常是在晨起后进行，测试前必须没有进行中等或大强度的活动。,Resting energy expenditure is normally measured in the morning after waking up without moderate or intense physical activity before the measurement is taken.
8087,测试必须在测试前夜间不进食的条件下，在室温适度的环境中卧位完成。,"The measurement has to be done after an overnight fast, in a thermoneutral environment in the supine position."
8087,"如果没有合适的测试仪器，可以使用按不同年龄范围校正的各种预测公式来计算安静能量消耗（FA0/WH0/UNU, 1985)。","If appropriate equipment is not available the REE can be calculated with the use of prediction formulae which are adjusted for the different age ranges (FAO/WHO/UNU, 1985)."
8088,奥林匹克理想的三根支柱是体育、文化和尊重。,"The three pillars of Ihe Olympic ideal are sport, culture and respect."
8088,奥林匹克的五大价值观则是:体育道德、教育、超越自我、团结、和平和快乐。,The five Olympic values are: sportsmanship; education; exceeding one’s expectations; solidarity; and peace and happiness.
8088,为奥林匹克理想服务的人们，肩负着将这些理想不断推向前进的使命，这是奥运会特许经营组织赖以存在的永恒不变的根基。,Those who serve it are charged with advancing that agenda.These values are the foundations upon which the Olympic franchise is based.They are immutable.
8088,运动员们付出自己生命中宝贵的时间来追随奥林匹克理想，原因也正在于此。,They are the reason why athletes are prepared to dedicate years of their lives to pursuing the Olympic dream.
8088,运动员们达到奥林匹克理想的努力成为一种精彩，而我们其他人也和他们一样，在此过程中得到提升。,"And we, like them, are elevated by the spectacle of their endeavour as they strive to live up to the Olympic ideals."
8088,这一点永远不能改变。,That must never change.
8089,这位领导人的讲话，延续了奥运会发展历史上的一个传统。在过去100年里，美国总统罗纳德·里根、比尔·克林顿、乔治·W·布什；大不列颠王国国王乔治六世、女王伊丽莎白二世；西班牙国王胡安·卡洛斯；法国总统密特朗；前苏联主席勃列日涅夫；还有日本裕仁和明仁天皇，都曾经宣布过这一全世界最大规模体育盛会的开幕。,"Jintao's speech follows in a tradition.Over the last century, American Presidents Reagan, Clinton, and George W Bush; along with King George VI and Oueen Elizabeth II of Great Britain; King Juan Carlos of Spain; President Mitterand of France; President Brezhnev of the Soviet Union; and Emperors Hirohito and Akihito of Japan have all opened the world’s greatest sporting festival.As the speech concludes, the Olympic cauldron is ignited."
8089,奥运火炬被点燃了，对于中国来说，这个光彩夺目的盛会将牢固地奠定自己在世界舞台上的地位，现在它正式开始了。,"China’s spectacular party, firmly establishing its position on the world stage, can officially begin."
8090,虽然白内障并不会真正造成视力的完全丧失，却能恶化到使你成为法定意义上的盲人。（法定意义上的目盲是指你无法在6米远的距离内看清视力表上的大号字母。,"Though cataracts don't really cause a total loss of vision, they can worsen to the point of making you legally blind (you've legally blind if you can't read the big letters on a vision chart from a distance of twenty feet)."
8090,）这种障翳可以被摘除，同时植入一种人工合成晶体就能解决这一问题。,They can be removed and a synthetic lens implanted to correct the problem.
8091,"做出反应的白细胞紧贴着巨噬细胞以获取更多关于入侵细菌的信息,并生成一种特殊的防御机制——把T细胞和B细胞召集到被感染区。",Responding white cells attach to the macrophage so they can learn more about the incaders and develop specialized defense mechanisms—in the form of calling T cells and B cells to the area.
8091,T细胞直接杀死入侵细菌或者帮助调整免疫系统的反应。,The T cells directly kill the invader or help coordinate the immuse system response.
8091,B细胞制造抗体像子弹一样摧毁入侵细菌。,The B cells create antibodies that act like bullets to destroy the invaders.
8091,当他们完成任务，多余的白细胞将会杀死它们自己 (细胞自杀机制），以使它们不会误杀我们自身健康的细胞，造成自体免疫疾病。,"When done, the excess white blood cells kill themselves (apoptosis) so that they won't kill our own healthy cells by mistake and cause an autoimmune disease."
8092,半俯卧撑非常重要，要熟练掌握。,The half pushup is an important exercise to master properly.
8092,很多人做俯卧撑的方法都不正确——撅屁股或者塌腰，这是因为他们的腰部肌肉和脊椎肌肉不发达。,"You see a lot of guys doing pushups incorrectly, with their butt moving up as they bend at the hips.They do this because their waist and spinal muscles are weak."
8092,这个动作可以锻炼你的腰部肌肉和脊椎肌肉，从而能够锁定臀部，使身体成一条直线。,This exercise trains the waist and spine to keep the hips locked and aligned.
8093,常见的瓣膜问题是二尖脱垂。,"The most common valve problem is matral valve prolapse (the name ""mitral"", by the way, comes from miter, the two-leaved hat worn by popes), in which the valve between the left atrium and left ventricle doesn't slam closed fully, just like in Figure"
8093,"补充一句，“二尖瓣”这个词源自“主教冠”,它是主教戴的帽子，有两个尖。",2.
8093,如图2.3所示，位于左心房和左心室之间的瓣膜不能正常闭合。,3.
8094,棒球击球手能用他们的眼睛盯住球吗？,Can baseball batters keep their eye on the ball?
8094,或者，更关键的问题是，他们的眼睛能跟 上球直到球到达球棒的接触点吗？,"Or, more to the point, can they follow the ball with their eyes to the point of its contact with the bat?"
8094,Robert Watts (罗伯特•瓦特）和Terry Bahill (特里•拜希尔）尝试着解决这个问题。,Robert Watts and Terry Bahill set out to find out.
8094,他们在实验室里，采用测量眼动的装备，模拟球场环境（一个串在鱼线上的白色塑料球，用滑轮驱动）对击球手进行测量。,"In the laboratory, they rigged batters with devices that measured eye movements as they swung at a simulated pitch (a white plastic ball threaded on a fishing line and propelled by a pulley)."
8094,他们有大量有趣的发现。,They had a number of interesting findings.
8094,首先是，专业的球员可以在他的视野范围内视觉追踪到角速度达到130rad/s的球。,"First, a professional player was able to visually track the ball at an angular velocity in his vision up to 130 degrees per second."
8094,如前所述，这样的速度已经远远超过了非运动员。,"As noted previously, that’s a lot faster than has been described in non-athletes."
8094,这说明，专业球员对飞向本垒的球有相当惊人的视觉追踪能力。,"It would seem, at least based on this one subject, that the professional ball player has rather an astounding ability to visually track a pitched baseball as it nears the plate."
8094,运动员可以在本垒5.5ft之内接到球。,"That athlete could follow the ball to within 5.5 feet of home plate, but not after."
8095,重量训练与暴饮暴食紧密相连。,Weight-training and the psychology of overeating go hand in hand.
8095,专业的举重运动员都认为，如果在锻炼前吃得多一点儿，举得就会好一点儿，肌肉就能多长一点儿。,"Before a hard session, an athlete convinces himself that if he eats more, he’ll lift better and put on beef."
8095,锻炼之后，运动员的体力被人为地耗尽，他们吃得也自然多一点儿。,"After a hard session, an athlete is artificially depleted and his appetite increases accordingly."
8096,它如何决定要做哪个，单位时间内更快还是更长。,How does it decide which to do?More strides or longer strides per time?
8096,乍一看，似乎可以假设它能在体能限制内利用任意一种机制来调整比赛速度。,"At first glance, it would seem hypothetically possible, at least within physical constraints, to utilize either mechanism to adjust race velocity."
8096,但是，正如下一节所示，这是不正确的。,"But, as the next section shows, that isn’t true."
8097,屈臂撑锻炼的肌肉与俯卧撑类似，因此我将其归为俯卧撑的变式。,"To give a couple of examples, dips work similar muscles to pushups, and are therefore seen as a variant."
8097,以前，倒立臂屈伸与倒立撑是相关联的练习动作，因此我将其归为倒立撑的变式。,"Tiger bends are a famous old-time exercise related to handstand pushups, and are seen as a variant."
8097,深蹲跳与跳箱子都属于爆发力式深蹲，因而我将其归为深蹲的变式。,"Jumping squats and box jumps are explosive versions of squats, and are considered to bevariants."
8098,通过实习，可以完全达到无意识、快速和精确地进行标记的程度。,"With practice, landmarking can be completed unconsciously, very rapidly and accurately."
8098,放弃、再定位和核查是一种机械的动作，确保皮肤表面记号没有偏离骨骼的骨性标志。,"The releasing, relocating and checking is automatic assuring the surface of the skin does not distort the location of the landmark."
8098,在定标过程中，都要使用双手。,Both hands are used in the process.
8098,在标定某些不典型人群时，我们概括了一些细微的差别。,We have included some nuances in how to locate landmarks on atypical subjects.
8099,标准倒立撑是标准的“囚徒”倒立撑，它可以强化肩部、肱三头肌、肘部、斜方肌、胸肌及双手——其实整个上半身的力量都会得到发展。,"The handstand pushup is the full Convict Conditioning handstand pushup, which develops and strengthens the shoulders, triceps, elbows, trapezius, pectorals and hands—in fact it has a power-building effect on the entire upper body."
8099,很多训练者都认为，倒立撑应该是“自由”的，即离开墙做。,"A lot of athletes feel the handstand pushup should be free—that is, clear of the wall."
8099,但这对平衡能力的要求极高。,But this is a test of balance as much as strength.
8099,所有老派倒立练习者都相信，要想拥有超凡的平衡能力，首先应该培养力量。,"All the old school hand-balancers believed that if you want balance, you should build strength first."
8100,标准深蹲是经典的自身体重练习动作。数千年来该动作始终流行于世，是有一定原因的。,"Full squats are the classic bodyweight leg exercise, used productively the world over for many thousands of years."
8100,标准深蹲能够强化膝关节，并增强大腿肌肉、臀部肌肉、脊椎肌肉和髋部肌肉的力量和运动能力。,"And not without reason; full squats strengthen the knees, and add power and athleticism to every muscle in the thighs, as well as the glutes, spinal muscles and hips."
8100,另外，这个动作也能使小腿部的胫骨前肌、脚踝，甚至包括脚掌得到相应的锻炼。,"The entire lower leg is conditioned, including the calves, anterior tibialis (shin muscles), ankles and even the soles of the feet."
8100,标准深蹲有助于让双腿保持年轻活力。,Full squats help legs retain their youthful vigor.
8101,标准引体向上是锻炼上背部与肱二头肌的经典练习。,The  full pullup is the classic muscle and power exercise for the upper back and biceps.
8101,掌握这个动作后，你将具有出众的行动能力与运动力量。,The master of this exercise will possess superior functional mobility and athletic strength.
8101,人类天生就善于把自己拉起来，一个男人要是连引体向上都做不了，那就称不上真的强壮。,The human body evolved to pull itself up well—a man who cannot do pullups cannot be considered to be truly strong.
8102,病毒需要借助你的身体逬行复制。,
8102,一种病毒通过侵入你的细胞并劫持你的细胞来起作用——基本上通过截取遗传密码。,A virus works by invading one of your cells and hijacking it —essentially taking over its genetic code.
8102,当病毒利用好细胞的自身复制工具时，它就像去了速递公司那里做了几万份的拷贝，然后通过你的血液全部传输出去。,"When the virus uses the good cell's replication machinery, it's like the virus had gone to kinko's and made millions of copies to send all throughout your bloodstream."
8103,勃起功能障碍像皱纹一样，伴随着衰老而生。,"Erectile dysfunction, like wrinkles and parfaking in early-bird dinner specials, increases as you age."
8103,它影响了5%的40-50岁的男性和高达25%的65岁男性。,"It affects 5 percent of men in their forties, up to 25 percent of men by the age of sixty-five, and over 50 percent of men who have reached eighty."
8103,80岁的男性半数有勃起问题，但这不说明你一定也会有同样的烦恼——特别是只要你能遵守本书第2章中提出的动脉健康行为准则，就会避免勃起问题。,"And while half of men experience some kind of erectile problem between the ages of forty and seventy, it doesn't mean you have to be one of them, even after eighty—especially if you follow our guidelines for optimum arterial health in Chapter 2."
8103,事实上，超过60%的70岁以上的男性都声称，自己的性健康状况良好。,"In fact, more than 60 percent of men in their seventies report that they're swinging the clubs just fine."
8104,还有一个脑部锻炼途径是人人都喜欢的——度假。,Here's one of our favorite ways to stretch your mind: vacations.
8104,度假对缓解压力和提高性生活质量都有很大帮助，而且度假还有助于提高认知能力。,"Sure, vacations are great for both your stress levels and your sex life.But they can also help improve your cognitive skills."
8104,是怎样提高的？,How?
8104,通过阅读地图。,Maps.
8104,当我们驾车、步行，或研究一座陌生城市的地铁系统时，就需要同时用到人脑的许多不同部分。,"When you're driving, walking, or studying the subway system of a new city, you're using many different parts of your brain at once."
8104,我们用空间想象能力读地图，然后再把获得的信息转换为语言符号，传达给驾车人。,"You're using visual-spatial skills to read a map, and then you need to translate it into verbal code to whoever s driving."
8105,客观性（测试者间信度）可以藉由以一位以上的测试者来收集资料而建立。,The degree of objectivity (intertester reliability) can be established by having more than one tester gather data.
8105,将此分数以组内相关方法分析，可以取得测试者间信度系数 。,Then the scores are analyzed with intraclass correlation techniques to obtain an intertester reliability coefficient.
8105,在一次分析中就可以评估许多不同来源变异量，这些变异量可以是来自测试者、测试、不同日期、参与者、以及误差所造成的变异量( 这些计算的讨论参见Safrit，1976)。,"It is possible to assess a number of sources of variance in one analysis, such as variance caused by testers, trials, days, participants, and error (for a discussion of the calculations involved, see Safrit, 1976)."
8106,附录中的表2显示了常态曲线的常态分布单位（z）。,Table 2 in the appendix shows a unit normal distribution (z) for a normal curve.
8106,字段z代表了平均数的位置。,The column z shows the location of the mean.
8106,当平均数在数据分布的正中间时，它的z等于.00；因此，.50 (50%）的分布高于平均数（在平均数右方），剩下.50 ( 50% )的分布则是余数(平均数左边）。,"When the mean is in the center of the distribution, its z is equal to .00; thus, .50 (50%) of the distribution is beyond (to the right of) the mean, leaving .50 (50%) of the distribution as a remainder (to the left of the mean)."
8106,当数据分布的平均值往常态曲线的右侧移动时（例如移到z为+ ls )，.8413 ( 84%)的分布在平均数左侧(余数），.1587则在平均数右侧（大于平均数）。,"As the mean of the distribution moves to the right in a normal curve (say, to a z of +ls), .8413 (84%) of the distribution is to the left of the mean (remainder) and .1587 is to the right of (beyond) the mean."
8106,这个表格能让你计算平均数加上任何标准偏差后，所包含的常态分布百分比。,This table allows you to determine the percentage of the normal distribution included by the mean plus any fraction of a standard deviation.
8107,有时候，研究生或教职员无意中也可能牵连抄袭。,"On occasion, a graduate student or faculty member can inadvertently be involved in plagiarism."
8107,这种情况通常发生在合著的研究。,This situation generally occurs on work that is coauthored.
8107,如果其中一位作者抄袭他人资料，其他作者也须承担同样罚责，即使他或她并不知道有抄袭。,"If one author plagiarizes material, the other could be equally punished even though he or she is unaware of the plagiarism."
8108,说“太胖的人不适合运动”就和说“太瘦的人不适合吃饭”一样没道理。,Saying you're too overweight to exercise is like saying you're too skinny to eat.
8108,我们的身体就像需要食物一样需要运动。,Your body needs exercise just the way your body needs food.
8108,不论你的体重多么超重，都可以做运动减肥，强筋健骨，给承担体重的关节减负。,"No matter how overweight you are, you can do something to start the process of losing fat, strengthening your bones, and relieving your joints of the load that they're carrying."
8109,费尔斯（Fels)法基于与TW法相同的20块骨骼并加上豌豆骨和内收肌籽骨。,The Fels method is based on the same 20 bones as the TW method plus the pisiform and adductor sesamoid.
8109,作者对每一块骨骼的成熟指标和特殊标准加以定义。,The authors defined their own maturity indicators and specific criteria for each.
8109,它是依据手和腕部一系列骨骼 形态变化以及长骨骼线性测量数据之间的比值建立的。,They are based on a variety of shape changes and several ratios between linear measurements of the long bones of the hand and wrist.
8109,通过与附有文字描述的标准X线片对照，对每块骨骼的标志进行定级。,Grades are assigned to the indicators for each bone by matching the film being assessed to the described criteria.
8109,评定的等级与比值输入计算机，计算出骨龄和标准误（SE)。,The assigned grades and ratios are then entered into a microcom puter which calculates an SA and an SE.
8110,在结束这个话题之前，我们应该把这点也加上去，即除了出生日期，出生地似乎也很重要。,"Before leaving this point, it should be added that in addition to birth date, location of birth also seems to be important."
8110,如果你想成为一个明星运动员，那你需要在Austin (奥斯汀）长大，而不是在纽约或者Miller’s Comers (米勒斯•康勒斯）。,"If you want to be a star athlete, grow up in Austin, not New York City or Miller’s Corners."
8110,好吧，这是有一点夸张的成分，但是关键点是，研究显示了一个不成比例的专业运动员的数量，他们都出生在 拥有少于500000而多于10000人口的城市。,"Well, that’s a bit of hyperbole, but the point is that studies indicate a disproportionate number of professional athletes grow up in cities with populations less than 500,000 but greater than 10,000."
8111,如果你还达不到该练习的初级标准，那就试着使用比篮球高的物体，椅子或矮咖啡桌都是不错的选择。,"If you can’t reach the beginner standard of this exercise, continue your unilateral training but try pressing off an object higher than the basketball.A chair seat or a low coffee table could be good choices."
8111,相比于使用篮球，这些物体可以在更大的运动范围内为你的手臂提供支撑。,This will free your arms to provide more support over a longer range of motion than is possible when you use a basketball.
8111,一旦你借助更高物体能完成该动作，就可以换用矮一些的物体，就这样循序渐进地练习，直到你准备好再次尝试用篮球做该动作。,"Once you master the exercise with a higher object, work with progressively smaller objects until you are ready to try the basketball again."
8112,垂直引体是动作非常轻微的引体向上动作。,Vertical pulls are a very gentle exercise.
8112,对那些背部和手臂力量正处于恢复阶段的训练者来说，这是非常理想的练习。此外，这个动作对肩部、肱二头肌或肘部受过伤的训练者而言更适合，因为它可以增加血液流动，并让他们的身体找回“拉力”的感觉。,"They are ideal for athletes rebuilding their back and arm strength, particularly following on from a shoulder, biceps or elbow injury.They increase blood flow and re-train the pulling “groove”."
8112,对初学者来说，这也是上好的练习。,This is also an excellent exercise for any beginner.
8112,由于该动作强度较小，可以使初尝拉力训练的人，在进入难度更大的动作之前真切地感受肩部和上背部肌肉的“发力” 。,"Its low intensity allows athletes new to pulling to really feel the muscles at work in the shoulders and upper back, before things get too heavy."
8113,自从能够正确追踪有生物学活性激素的较 新的第三代LH检测法得到应用以来，人们发现在青春发育期的所有阶段都有促黄体生成激素的脉冲释放。,"Pulsatile release of luteinizing horm one (LH) is found at all stages of pubertal development, especially since the newer, third generation LH assays that faithfully track biologically active horm one have been used."
8113,应用这些测定技术，真正的脉冲性LH(和FSH)的释放能够在青春期前(阶段I)和青春期早期的儿童中测试到。,With these assays truly pulsatile LH (and FSH) release can be detected in prepubertal (stage I) as well as early pubertal children.
8113,这样，可以将激素分泌正常与患永久性低促性腺激素性腺机能低下症的儿童加以区别。,
8113,,Such secretion could be distinguished from that in children with permanent hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism.
8114,使用0.15-0.3 mg的小剂量共轭雌激素的替代疗法应该尽可能延后进行，因为即使小剂量的雌激素也有可能加速骨骼的发育。,Low dose replacement therapy with 0 .15 —0.3 mg of conjugated oestrogens should be delayed as long as possible since even small doses of oestrogen may rapidly accelerate skeletal development.
8114,在 6~12个月后，在每月的12~25天添加醋酸甲孕酮（5~10 mg)来引导月经周期。,After 6—12 months medroxyprogesterone acetate ( 5 - 1 0 mg) is added on days 1 2 —25 of the month to induce menstrual cycles.
8114,随后，在每月的1~25天雌激素的剂量增加到 0.6~1.25mg。,"Subsequently, the oestrogen dose is increased to 0.6—1.2 5 m gon days 1 —25 of the month."
8115,作为进化树顶端的优势之一，动物逐渐表现出更髙级的大脑结构，特别是大脑皮层。,"As one examines ascendancy of the evolutionary tree, animals progressively exhibit extensive development of higher brain structures, particularly the cerebral cortex."
8115,因此，可以预测，大脑内更高的控制点将作为CPGs发挥作用。,"It might be expected, then, that higher controlling sites within the brain would begin to play a role as CPGs."
8115,猴子和其他非人类灵长类动物在这一点上提供了一些信息。,Monkeys and other nonhuman primates provide some information on this point.
8116,大腿中点（mid-thigh)。,Mid-thigh.
8116,可以用几种方法来定位大腿中点。,There are several methods for locating the mid-thigh.
8116,一种是在受试者取坐位时，取从腹股沟线到髌骨前缘之间距离的一半。,One is to use half the measured distance in a seated subject from the inguinal line at mid-thigh to the anterior margin of the patella.
8116,这是与测量大腿中点皮褶的估计技术是一致的。,This is consistent with the technique for estimating the site for obtaining mid-thigh skinfolds.
8116,对于围度测量，我们喜欢采用受试者在站立时，从大转子最高点 (前面提到的）起到胫骨茎突最远端之间的测量距离的一半来确定大腿的中点。,For girth measurement we prefer defining the mid-thigh as half the measured distance from the previously located trochanerion to the tibiale laterale when the subject stands erect.
8117,单臂半俯卧撑是俯卧撑系列的第八式。,Half one-arm pushups are Step 8 of the pushup series of movements.
8117,通过这个练习，训练者可以逐步从双侧练习转为单侧练习。,"With this technique, the athlete finally moves from bilateral (two-sided) exercises to unilateral (one-sided) work."
8117,该动作可以提高你的平衡能力，而这对做单臂俯卧撑极其重要。,This is an important stage in the series.Working on half one-arm pushups will teach the athlete the balance and positioning necessary to master full one-arm pushups.
8118,在引体向上系列中，这是第一个用单臂拉起全部体重的动作。,This is the first step in the series where the student pulls his total bodyweight with one hand.
8118,该动作可以帮助训练者高平衡能力，熟悉标准单臂引体向上所要求的发力方法。单臂半引体向上还会发展肱二头肌和背部的力量，练就粗壮的手臂。,"As well as teaching the balance and technical groove required for full one-arm pullups, 1/2 one-arm pullup develops huge biceps and back power and builds big arms."
8118,但由于运动幅度只有一半，所以练习该动作之后，你需要补充一些完整幅度的动作，比如偏重引体向上或窄距引体向上。,"It doesn’t train the muscles in the stretched position though, so add a full-range motion such as uneven pullups or close pullups afterwards."
8119,单臂倒立撑是锻炼肩部和手臂的终极动作。,The  one-arm handstand pushup is the ultimate shoulder and arm exercise.
8119,忘掉卧推吧——它只能给你带来伤痛和不幸。,Forget bench presses—all they cause is injury and grief.
8119,谨慎练习整个倒立撑系列，直至掌握最终式，你的力量会比你碰到的所有练卧推的都大——这里说的是纯粹、有用、能把人抓起来扔出去的力量。,"Work your way carefully through the handstand pushup series right up to this Master Step and you will be stronger—in terms of pure, functional, pick someone up and throw them power—than any bench presser you meet."
8120,姿势正确的单臂俯卧撑是检验胸部与肘部力量的黄金标准，而且能够让人一见难忘。,"The one-arm pushup when performed with pure form, is the gold standard of chest and elbow power, and it’s an impressive sight to see."
8120,许多健身者都声称自己能做单臂俯卧撑，但你千万不要被他们蒙骗。,"Many athletes claim to be able to do this exercise without any problems, but don’t be fooled."
8120,当你让他们动真格的时候，你就会发现，他们所谓的单臂俯卧撑就是个笑话：双腿朝两边分开，上身丑陋地扭曲——这是为了更容易做动作，然后他们会用摇摇摆摆、虚弱无力的胳膊猛地将自己推起，而且他们只能完成少数几次反复。,"When you ask them to put their money where their mouth is, their pushups are a joke—they splay out their legs, twist their torsos into ugly shapes to make the exercise easier, and violently strain for shallow reps on wobbly, weak arms."
8121,不靠“蹬腿”的完整幅度的单臂引体向上，可能是最伟大的背部与手臂练习，它可以赋予你强悍的力量与块头。,"One-arm pullups, performed deeply and without “kipping” are the greatest back and arm exercise possible.They confer mighty strength and size."
8121,掌握单臂引体向上后，你的背阔肌就会像一对翅膀一般，上背部也会发展出如蟒蛇盘绕交错般的肌肉。,The master of this exercise will earn lats that look like wings and his upper back will be sprouting muscles like coiled pythons.
8121,此外，你的抓握力、上臂及前臂力量会比健身房里的那些寻常鼠辈不知强多少倍——你很可能在摔跤比赛中把那些所谓健美人士的手臂扯下来。,"Plus, he’ll own a grip, arms and forearms vastly more powerful than the average gym rat—in fact he could probably rip a bodybuilder’s arm off in an arm wrestling match."
8122,第一式肩倒立深蹲最容易，第十式单腿深蹲最难。,"Step 1, the shoulderstand squat, is the easiest version of the movement; Step 10, the full one-leg squat, is the hardest variation."
8122,几乎人人都能做肩倒立深蹲，即使他的身体很弱。相反，几乎没人能够第一次就完成单腿深蹲，不管他多么健康、多么强壮。,"Almost everybody will be able to do shoulderstand squats straight away, no matter how weak or infirm they are; hardly anybody will be able to do one-leg squats on the first time of asking, no matter how fit or strong they are."
8122,我之所以构建这样的体系，就是为了让健身者做自己的教练，从而在没有器械辅助的情况下，慢慢到达能够做上20-50次单腿深蹲。,"The purpose of this structure is to allow the individual trainee—training alone as his own coach, and with no special equipment—to work his way up gradually to be able to do one-leg squats for sets of twenty to fifty reps."
8123,食道与胃部的相接角度很小，以减轻反胃现象，但是一旦相接处被打开（交角增大），我们就会由于胃食道反流而产生胃部灼热和消化不良。,"The esophagus makes a sharp angle as it enters the stomach to reduce this regurgitation, but if the junction is opened (the angle is reduced), we get burning and indigestion from GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disorder)."
8123,胆囊储存着胆汁，当食物团通过胃部的时候，胆汁就会分泌到小肠里。,"The gallbladder stores bile, which can be secreted into the small bowel once the food bolus has passed through the stomach."
8123,有时，储存的胆汁会硬化，形成胆结石，人会感觉很疼。,The stored bile can harden and form painful gallstones.
8124,食物经过胃部后，就来到了小肠，与绿色的胆汁混合在一起。胆汁是由肝脏产生的液态物质，能够包裹乳化脂肪。,"After the stomach, food moves into the small intestine and mixes with green bile --the liquid material made by the liver that surrounds and emulsifies the fat you gobbled down at last night's movie."
8124,胆汁工作的情况像肥皂分解油溃一样，这种绿色的液体令脂肪溶解在水中，便于人体更有效地消化食物。,Bile works the way soap dissolves grease; this green fluid makes fat soluble in water so you can digest food more efficiently.
8124,胆囊储存着人体的胆汁，当食物从胃里涌到小肠处时，胆囊就喷出胆汁。,The gallbladder stores your bodys bile so it can be squirted as a bolus when food comes gushing around the corner from the stomach.
8125,高脂饮食会导致胆囊收缩，更增加了结石带来的痛苦。,"Fatty meals, which cause your gallbladder to contract, can increase the pain from your existing stones."
8125,这里有一个方法可以检验自己的腹痛是否是由胆结石引起的。,So there's a way that you can actually test yourself to see if your belly pain is caused by gallstones.
8125,去快餐店吃少量高脂饮食，比如一两块肯德基原味炸鸡（不错，这是惟一一次医生向你推荐这种食品）。,"Go out and eat a small amount of a highly fatty fast-food meal, like a piece or two of original Kentucky Fried Chicken (yes, this is the only time you hear us recommend that)."
8125,如果你吃起来不觉得腹痛，可能没有胆结石；如果吃的时候感觉腹痛，这就可能是胆结石的信号，你就得去看看消化科大夫怎么说了。,"If you can eat it without pain, you likely don't have gallbladder disease.If you have pain when you're eating it, that's a probable sign of gallbladder disease, and you'll need to see a gallbladder surgeon."
8126,此外，大的动作幅度会使肱骨扭转，并刺激肩袖，但练习倒立撑时不会这样。,"In addition, very deep motions—which would twist the humerus and irritate the rotator cuff—are impossible during handstand pushups."
8126,倒立撑就如同反过来的肩部推举，但是在头部接触地板后身体就不能再下降了。,You can’t lower yourself until the floor is on your shoulders—the inverted equivalent of a shoulder press—for the simple reason that the head gets in the way.
8126,此外，倒立撑中手掌平放的姿势比杠铃抓握的姿势更安全，平放的手掌可以均匀分布压力，从而以健康和谐的方式强化前臂（对俯卧撑也是如此）。,"Plus, the flat hand position is safer than the barbell grip; the flat hands distribute pressure evenly, allowing the forearms to strengthen in a healthy, harmonious way."
8126,推举时抓握杠铃，会引起前臂和肘部出现类似网球肘的问题。,Gripping the bar during presses is what causes forearm and elbow problems like tennis elbow.(This is as true for the standard pushup as it is for the handstand variety.)
8126,只要方式正确，倒立撑相当安全。,Handstand pushups—done properly—are incredibly safe.
8127,蹬腿会给关节带来不必要的压力，造成一种很有力量的错觉，动作也容易走形。,"Kipping puts unnecessary stress on the joints, gives a false sense of strength and encourages sloppy form."
8127,因此，初学者在做引体向上时千万不要蹬腿，应该坚持标准的姿势——经2秒钟拉起身体，暂停1秒钟，再经2秒钟放低身体，再暂停1秒钟。,"For that reason, it should never be used by beginners, who should stick with perfect form—two seconds up, a one second pause then two seconds down, followed by another one second pause."
8127,记住，千万不要用惯性。,No momentum should be used.
8128,"如果需要治疗，通常是用促性腺性类固醇激素治疗，每天5~20μg,治疗几个月。最常用的是每天0.3~0.6 mg复合雌性激素或乙基雌二醇。","If therapy is needed, it is usually with gonadal steroid horm ones, often 0 .3—o.6mg daily conjugated equine oestrogens or ethinyl oestradiol,5 —20 μg daily for several months."
8128,"如果治疗需要延长，可以慎重使用醋酸甲孕丽（medroxyprogesterone acetate),每月 10~14天，每天10mg,来诱导月经周期。","If prolonged therapy is necessary, the addition of medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg daily for 10 —14 days of each month to induce menstrual periods is prudent."
8128,后者极少用于体质性的发育延迟的女孩，但是必须用于低促性腺激素性功能低下症（hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism)的女孩（见后)。,"The latter is rarely necessary for girls with constitutional delay, but is required for those with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism (see below)."
8129,我们也以较哲学性的讨论科学与求知的方法 ，提出从事研究的另类方式。,We also present alternative approaches for doing research relative to a more philosophical discussion of science and ways of knowing.
8129,尤其是 ，我们探讨使用质性研究、实地研究，与以内省的方法做为回答研究问题的策略。而非依赖传统的科学典范架构做为研究问题探讨的唯一方法。,"In particular, we address qualitative research, the use of field studies, and methods of introspection as strategies for answering research questions instead of relying on the traditional scientific paradigm as the only approach to research problems."
8130,但是接下来发生的事情我并没有预料到。,But what happened to me next was unexpected.
8130,在麦肯齐的CFE讲座视 频中，他否定了长久以来训练长距离跑步的定律，例如，保持高跑量、 注重长距离训练和配合周期训练。,"I continued watching MacKenzie’s CFE lecture videos as he ticked through the long-held tenets of distance running, such as doing high mileage, focusing on long runs, and incorporating periodization."
8130,他彻底否定了以上定律，取而代之的训练重点变成如技巧训练、力量训练和体能训练，肌肉耐力的重要 性取代了心血管耐力。,"He systematically rejected them all, supplanting them with priorities such as skill work, strength and conditioning, and replacing cardiovascular endurance with muscular stamina."
8130,虽然我仍然持保留意见，但是在继续听讲座的过程中，我发现自己很难反驳他的观点。,"I flinched with each swap, but I kept listening, and in each case, I found I had a hard time refuting his argument."
8131,由于人体在跑动过程中要应对重心平衡和冲击力的问题，越来越多的教练开始注重训练正确的跑步姿势。,"More and more coaches are looking closely at the mechanics of proper running form as the body deals with gravity, balance, and impact force during the running movement."
8131,这种新观点的拥护者们相信，优秀跑者是创造出来的，而不是天生的。,"Advocates of this newer approach believe that good runners are made, not born."
8131,想要拥有正确的跑步姿势和避免受伤，跑者应该有规律地进行动作训练和练习，以提高臀部和腘绳肌的力量、加强腿部的灵活性和增加动作的幅度。,"To obtain proper form and avoid injury, runners should routinely perform movement drills as well as exercises to develop hip and hamstring strength, elasticity in the legs, and range of motion."
8132,冷损伤可以是表浅的（冻疮）和全身的（体温过低）。,Cold injuries may be superficial (frostbite) or systemic (hypothermia).
8132,冻疮的早期体征和症状包括局部疼痛和皮肤发红，随着严重程度的增加皮肤可以由红变白。,Early signs and symptoms of frostbite include local pain and red skin which may become white with an increase in severity.
8132,根据作者的了解，还没有报告过儿童在寒冷中运动时有体温过低（直肠体温<35°C）的体征。,"To the author's know ledge, there are no reports of hypothermia (rectal temperature < 35°C) among children during exercise in the cold."
8132,这是由于大多数体育活动都可引起代谢率的上升，足以代偿身体热量在外周的丢失。,"This is due to the fact that the elevated metabolic rate, which characterizes most athletic activities, compensates for the body heat lost to the periphery."
8133,用下肢来推动整个身体，这是开始脊柱训练最温和的方式。因为在日常生活中，我们通常都是通过腿部带动脊柱活动的，比如散步、弯腰等。,"Pushing through the lower limbs, and are the gentlest way to begin spinal training because in everyday life we usually activate the spinal muscles via the legs.We do this simply by moving around, bending down, etc."
8133,在短桥的最高处保持躯干伸直的动作，会刺激脊椎和髋部的肌肉，同时几乎不会给脊椎骨造成任何压力。,The act of keeping the trunk straight at the top of the short bridging movement stimulates the spine and hip muscles with hardly any pressure running through the vertebrae.
8133,所以，对椎间盘有伤的人来说，这是极好的治疗动作。,As a result this exercise is wonderful therapy for those who have suffered disc injuries.
8134,如果儿童运动生理学研究的领域要发展，至关重要的是要熟悉和应用定标的原理。,"If research in the area of paediatric physiology of exercise is to develop, it is vital that the principles of scaling are embraced and applied."
8134,这可能牵涉到：放弃比值标准的优先使用，比值标准只有在坦纳（1949)所指出的特殊情况被找到和证实的时候才能使用。,This will probably involve: Abandoning a priori use of ratio standards and restricting their use solely to when Tanner's (1949) special circumstance has been sought and verified.
8134,限制线性建模，通过ANCOVA处理对数转换数据基础上进行组群间比较。,Restricting linear modelling via ANCOVA to comparisons of groups based on logarithmic transformations.
8134,优先使用异速生长模型来建立标 准对个体进行比较，并作为组群间比较的基础。,Preferential use of allometric modelling to construct standards against which individuals can be compared and as a basis for comparisons between groups.
8134,在纵向的、反复测试的设计中应用多级模型。,The application of multilevel modelling to longitudinal repeated measures designs.
8135,评估多元回归（模式）的基本方法跟仅有两个变项的回归模式相同：相关性的大小。,The basic procedure to evaluate multiple regression is the same as that used in regression with only two variables: the size of the correlation.
8135,相关系数越高，则预测越准确。,"The higher the correlation, the more accurate the prediction."
8135,但也应该提到其它的因素。,But some other factors should be mentioned.
8136,需要纵向研究数据来说明训练对生长、发育的作用。,Longitudinal data are needed to address the effects of training on growth and maturation.
8136,两项针对男孩的纵向研究表明，虽然不活动的男孩体重偏大，但是参加活动和不参加活动男孩在身高（图 1.8)、PHV出现的年龄和PHV本身没有任何区别。,"Data from two longitudinal studies of boys indicate no differences in the statures (Fig. 1.8 ), ages at PHV and PHVs of active and inactive boys,, although inactive boys tend io be slightly heavier."
8136,比利时男孩中参加活动和不参加活动者在骨龄上也没有差别（Beimen et al.，1992b)。,"SAs of active and inactive Belgian boys also do not differ (Beunen et al., 1992b)."
8136,相反，波兰和捷克正规参加运动的男孩普遍比他们各自国家的不活动的男孩身材高，并且PHV的年龄出现早 (图1.8)。,"Conversely, Polish and Czech boys regularly active in sport are consistently taller than respective reference data for each country, and also attain PHV at an earlier age (Fig. 1.8)."
8137,只在色拉里加几片西红柿是不能产生抗癌效果的，西红柿需要煮熟以提供最多的营养。意大利面条里的番茄酱其实是提供番茄红累的最佳食品。首先，它是煮熟的；其次，为了能很好地吸收番茄红素，你同时需要摄入少量脂肪，而意大利面条里的番茄酱正好也含有脂肪。,"But you can't just slice a few tomatoes into your salad to reap the effect; the tomato needs to be cooked in order to provide the most nutrients, Spaghetti sauce is actually the optimal food for lycopene; first of all, it’s cooked，and second, for good absorption you need toconsume a little fat with the lycopene, and tomato sauce contains that as well."
8138,研究还发现，在体育竞赛的参与者中，男孩和女孩的学习成绩不同。,Differences were found in the academic achievement of boy and girl participants in competitive sports.
8138,比尔曼指出，男孩运动员的学习成绩通常比女孩运动员高。,Buhrmann (1972) reported that boy athletes are usually higher in academic achievement than girl athletes.
8138,邓克尔曼在 1981年对运动参与者和非参与者的比较研究中发现，不参加体育运动的学生中，女孩的学习成绩比男孩高，而在学生运动员里，则是男孩比女孩高。,"Dunkelman (1981) who compared groups of participants and non-participants in sport, found that nonparticipant girls are higher in academic achievement than boys, while among the student athletes boys have higher academic achievement than girls."
8138,她认为这一发现与男孩比女孩更加积极参加运动这一现象存在着必然联系。,She related this finding with the fact that boys participate in sports more actively than girls.
8139,引发心血管胸痛的另外的重要原因是由未被发现的肥厚性心肌病引起的心肌缺血或冠状动脉供血不全。,Another important cardiovascular cause of chest pain is unrecognized hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with its resultant ischaemia and coronary insufficiency.
8139,这些人通常需要靠心脏病科医生的帮助来作出正确的诊断。,These individuals often require the help of a cardiologist to make the proper diagnosis.
8139,主动脉狭窄（瓣膜下的，瓣膜的和瓣膜上的）也能够引起胸痛，胸痛可以在用力时发生，也可以在安静时发生。,"Aortic stenosis (subvalvular, valvular and supravalvular) also may cause chest pain, with or without exertion."
8139,对这些患者进行听诊时常常会发现相应的杂音。,Appropriate murmurs are often present.
8140,开放式的题目有时是为了拟订封闭式题目而设计的。,Sometimes open-ended questions are used to construct closed questions.
8140,例如用来评量教学品质的项目，常常是从学生们对于课程喜欢和不喜欢的事项中整理出来的。,Student course evaluations are often developed by having students list all the things they like and dislike about a course.
8140,学生们所提出的答案，经过归纳的过程，才形成各项封闭式的题目。,"From such lists, closed questions are constructed by categorizing the open-ended responses."
8141,对利迪亚德训练方案的挑战并不是从麦肯齐开始的。,Challenges to the Lydiard method did not start with MacKenzie.
8141,最早的挑战之一起源于20世纪80年代，来自教练彼得•科埃。他为儿子——中长跑运动员塞巴斯蒂安•科埃，制定了一套高强度间歇训练方案（HIIT）。,"One of the first came in the 1980s from coach Peter Coe, who adopted a type of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) for his son, middle-distance runner Sebastian Coe."
8141,这套方案保证塞巴斯蒂安•科埃的周跑量在80千米以内，并结合200米一组、间歇为30秒的速度跑训练。,Their plan kept Seb’s total mileage under 50 miles per week and included fast 200-meter repeats with 30 seconds of recovery between the fast segments.
8141,整套训练方案中还包括负重训练和增强式训练，和今天我们在训练馆里看到的传统CrossFit训练组合类似。,They also included weight training movements and plyometric exercises in a routine that looked similar to the typical CrossFit workouts one might see in a gym today.
8142,辛格显然没有“内心不甘”，他必须“承受暴力再保持沉默”。,"Harbhajan has clearly not ""seethed within,"" having to ""listen to abuses and keep quiet."""
8142,后殖民主义复仇叙事从来不被允许在这之中采用，尤其考虑到殖民统治者“分而治之”的策略。,"The postcolonial revenge narrative can never be permitted to be directed within, especially given the divide-and-conquer strategies of colonial powers."
8142,这内外的二元结构清晰地勾勒了辛格对与斯里山特发生肢体冲突后的反应。,This outsider-insider binary structure is clearly delineated in Harbhajan's reflection on the physical confrontation with Sreesanth.
8143,另外，复合维生素能够推迟这一变性，或在某些情况下防止有些人的早期湿性黄斑变性转变成失明。,We also know that multivitamins can delay or in some cases prevent early wet macular degeneration from becoming ''eye blinding' in some people.
8143,我们知道黄斑变性是由基因引起的，但更是由生活方式所造成。,We know that macular degeneration isn't as much of a genetic condition as it is one of lifestyle.
8143,所以，选择正确的生活方式，保持血管年轻，你将会减少这两种形式的黄斑变性的发生几率。,So making lifestyle choices that keep your arteries young will reduce your chances of developing both forms of macular degeneration.
8144,加强腹肌力量以支撑背部的最简单的方法之一就是保持良好的姿势。,One of the easiest ways to strengthen your abdominal muscles and support your back—is through good posture.
8144,你自己可能觉得已经站得很直了，但实际上，我们大多数人的站姿都像比萨斜塔。,"You may feel like you’re standing straight, but in reality, most of us stand like the Leaning Tower of Pisa."
8144,要训练良好的体姿，就要让头和脖子往后靠。,Practice good posture by bringing your head and neck back.
8145,高敏C反应蛋白衡量的是人体发炎的程度，包括了慢性瘘管炎 、尿道感染或牙龈发炎等各种情况。,"HsCRP (hs stands for high sensitivity) measures the level of inflammation in your body, including anything from a chronic sinus infection to urinary-tract infections or gum inflammation."
8145,这种蛋白质的含量越高，人体患上心脏病的几率也越高。因为体内发生的明显炎症都会增大血管发炎的可能。,"If it is high, your risk of heart disease is higher, because any significant inflammation in your body increases inflammation in your blood vessels."
8146,干细胞研究是最近几年最热门的。,One of the hottest political issues of the last few years has revolved around stem cell research.
8146,干细胞是原始细胞，所有其他细胞的生成都是来自原始细胞。这些细胞的生成有多种可能，一个干细胞可以变成心脏细胞或血细胞。,Stem cells are the initial cells from which all other cells can be made—they have multiple potentials: A stem cell can turn into a heart cell or a brain cell or a blood cell.
8147,在任何一所健身馆的举重间里，只有一件事比更衣室的气味更让人难以忍受，那就是炫耀男性气概。,"In the weight room at any coed gytn, there's only one thing that smells worse than the locker room—the machismo."
8147,小伙子们像烦躁的公牛一样嘟嘟囔囔，掀起衬衫比比看谁的腹肌更像车轮印。,"Guys grunt like agitated bulls, and lift their shirts to see how closely their abs resemble tire treads."
8147,不是每个健身馆都是这样，但是只要把一群充满男性激素的小伙子与杠铃摆到一起，就总有引人入胜的戏码上演。,"Not every gym is like that, but there's always a fair share of one-upsmanship when you mix together a bunch of testosterone-filled guys with barbells."
8148,高低桥是桥系列中第一个标准的“头手并列”姿势的练习。,
8148,,Angled bridges are the first exercise in the bridging series to utilize the full “hands alongside head” position used in advanced bridging.
8148,这种姿势会强化训练者的腕部，打开其肩部与胸部，为之后的动作打下基础。,This position will strengthen the wrists and open up the shoulders and chest in preparation for later exercises.
8148,相比于之前的几式，此动作要求脊椎上部有更高的柔韧性和收缩力。,This motion also requires greater flexibility and contractile strength in the upper spine than the earlier steps.
8149,如果父母一方或其他近亲在年轻时就患有心脏病或动脉硬化，你患病的几率就会比一般人大得多。,"If a parent or other close family member developed heart disease or hardening of the arteries relatively early in life, your chances are significantly higher than the average person of developing it also."
8149,类脂分泌异常的问题也可能遗传，也就是说，有含量过高或HDL含量过低的趋势。,"Abnormalities in lipid production can be inherited—that is, a tendency to have higher HDL or lower HDL levels."
8149,其他危险因素如高血压或高半胱氨酸含量高也会遗传。,Other risk factors like high blood pressure or high homocysteine levels can be inherited as well.
8150,"进行工作分析的方法步骤也不太一致,换句话说,差异很大。",The procedures in conducting a job analysis vary.
8150,"但是不管如何,工作分析的目的就是为了尽量去获取与工作相关的一些资讯,以及成功担任此工作所必须具备的一些条件。",The objective is to obtain as much relevant information as possible about the job and the job requirements.
8150,一个办法就是对从事某职业的某人进行观察。,One method is to observe someone in the occupation.
8151,年龄还会影响到代谢和生物力学指标，而这又会对运动时的能量消耗、做功量和工作效率发生作用。,"Metabolic and biomechanical performance parameters are also influenced by age.These factors, in turn, contribute to the differences in energy cost, work and efficiency during exercise."
8151,与成年人比较，儿童个子矮、腿短，致使在走步或跑步时的步幅较小、步频快。,"Children are typically smaller, have shorter legs, causing their stride frequency during walking or running to be greater and their stride length to be shorter than in adults."
8151,然而，在任何特定年龄，步幅与腿长的比值却很相近。,"However, the ratio of stride length to leg length may be similar at any given age."
8152,如果你真的在某个动作上碰到了问题，根本做不了几次，可以尝试巩固训练。,"If you are really having a problem getting just a handful of reps on a particular exercise, try consolidation training."
8152,这是我从一位狱友那里学来的。,Consolidation training is a handy little trick I learnt from a fellow prison athlete.
8152,大多数时候，我们的训练应该集中于大约 10~25 次反复的范围内，这对关节、肌肉以及力量的发展都有好处。,"Most of the time, you should focus on moderate to high repetitions, somewhere in the ten to twenty-five range.This is good for building strength, muscle, and joint integrity."
8152,此外，能做更多次反复也意味着当你升级到更难的动作时，感觉会更轻松。,"Higher reps also mean that when you move to harder exercises, they will seem easier by contrast."
8153,巩固训练是处理这种状况的好办法。,Consolidation training is an excellent way of coping with this situation.
8153,不是一周锻炼一两次，每次都努力增加次数，而是尝试每天都练习这个新动作，有时甚至是一天练习两三回。,"Instead of working the new exercise once or twice a week and struggling to improve your reps every time, try working the new exercise every day—sometimes even twice or three times a day."
8153,放松，然后每回不是尽可能做更多次，而是最多只做一两次。,"Loosen up, then instead of doing as many reps as possible, only do one—two at the very most."
8154,实验设计的方式有时也可用来证明构念效度。,An experimental approach is occasionally used in demonstrating construct validity.
8154,例如，一个心肺适能的测验如果能反映体能训练后的适能进步，就会被认为是具有构念效度。,"For example, a test of cardiorespiratory fitness might be assumed to have construct validity if it reflected gains in fitness following a conditioning program."
8154,相同的，动作技能测验的编制者，可借由其测验得分能有效区别有接受教导与无接受教导的学童团体，因而证明此测验具有构念效度。,"Similarly, the originator of a motor skills test could demonstrate construct validity through its sensitivity in differentiating between groups of instructed and noninstructed children."
8155,骨豁宽度测量夹子（bone clipers)。,Bone calipers.
8155,用于测量肱骨和股骨宽度的Mitutoyo骨骼夹子最先是由卡特（1980)接受和推荐的。,Adapted Mitutoyo bone calipers first described by Carter (1980) are recommended for humerus and femur widths.
8155,这类夹子的夹臂较长，有15mrn直径的压力金属板。,These calipers have extended branches with round pressure plates of 15 mm diameter.
8155,Mitutoyo夹子的两臂间距较大，连动装置牢固，容易操作。,The inside diameter branches of the Mitutoyo caliper are removed and the locking device is fixed to permit easy manipulation.
8155,罗斯等 (1993)详细说明过类似性质的电子装置，在非专业的机械商店里出售，但是，这种承接定做的夹子的价格令人望而却步。,"An electronic version based on similar design features for replication in non-specialized machine shops has been specified by Ross et al. (1993), however, cost for such custom calipers may be prohibitive."
8156,沃尔夫氏定律也同样适用于骨骼的密 度。,Wolff's law also applies to the density of bone.
8156,"大量的研究证实，运动员的骨骼矿物质密度（BMD)大于非运动员（Nilsson & Westlin, 1971; Bailey et al.，1986)。","Numerous studies have observed higher BMD values in athletes compared to nonathletes (Nilsson & Westlin, 19 71; Bailey et al., 1986)."
8156,"长期 从事网球训练的运动员用力侧手臂的骨骼 矿物质含量高于非用力侧手臂（Huddleston et al.，1980; Pimay et al., 1987)。","Lifetime tennis players have significantly greater bone mineral content in the dominant arm in contrast to the non-dominant arm (Huddleston et al., 1980; Pirnay et al., 1987)."
8156,"对有活 动和没有活动人群的横向比较研究显示， 骨骼矿物质密度与体力活动之间存在着正相关的关系（Snow-Harter & Marcus, 1991)。","Cross-sectional studies examining active and sedentary populations indicate a positive relationship between physical activity and BMD (Snow-Harter & Marcus, 1991)."
8157,通常情况下，人体可以循环利用陈旧的骨元素来更新骨骼。在更新过程中，人体新近吸收的钙和镁等物质也会存储在骨头里，令骨质坚硬紧密。,"Normally, your body recycles old bone components to make new ones, and it also deposits new calcium and other minerals into your bones to make them hard and dense."
8157,不过，人一过35岁，骨骼生长就停顿下来，骨密度逐渐降低，这就意味着骨头的硬性物质减薄，而那些小孔则会增大，骨骼会因此变得越来越空洞，越来越脆弱，更易于受到外部伤害而发生骨折。,"But after you turn thirty-five, your bones stop growing and you gradually lose bone density, which means that those holes get larger while the hard substance gets thinner.So your bones become more porous, weaker, and more susceptible to injury and fractures if you don't do things to protect them from aging."
8158,骨软骨炎导致骨骺异常骨化区域的分离。,Osteochondritis causes separation of abnormal ossification areas within the epiphysis.
8158,骨软骨病是一种发育紊乱并与软骨骨化有关。,Osteochondroses are developmental disorders associated with anatomical sites undergoing transition from cartilage to bone.
8158,此种紊乱的发生形式各异，帕帕斯（1989）指出生物力学因素在其中起重要作用。,"These disorders occur in different forms, but biomechanical factors can play a role in the course of the disorder as described by Pappas (1989)."
8159,但并不是所有的癌症都是肿瘤或肿块，这使得它们更难诊断。,But not all cancers are tumors or lumps—making them even more difficult to diagnose.
8159,血液类癌症，比如白血病就不是通常意义上的肿瘤，而是在骨髓中所积累的不正常的白细胞。它们聚集在一起，使得健康的白细胞和红细胞濒临饿死，即使你的身体无法保证不被感染，也不能输送你所需要的氧。,"Blood-borne cancers such as leukemia are not like tumors in the usual sense.Instead, abnormal white blood cells accumulate in bone marrow and crowd or starve out healthy white and red blood cells—making your body unable to protect itself against infection and unable to deliver as much oxygen as you need."
8160,骨的再成型虽然多见于青年人，但也是变更成人骨骼形态和重量的主要过程。,"Remodelling, although present in young individuals, is the predominant bone process modifying shape and mass in adults."
8160,与骨成型不同，骨再成型对骨质的储存库（bone bank)没有作用。,"Unlike modelling, remodelling does not make a contribution to the 'bone bank'."
8160,"骨再成型的主要功能是修复日常的正常应力造成的骨豁微细的骨折（micro-fractures) (Prost, 1989b)。","The primary function of remodelling is to repair micro-fractures that occur with normal everyday stress (Frost, 1989b)."
8160,在正常的骨再成型过程中，骨豁再吸收成骨细胞（osteoblasts)和形成骨髂的破骨（osteoclasts)的作用同时发生，因此，随着再吸收就出现骨骼的形成作用。,"In normal remodelling, the bone resorbing osteoclast cells and the bone-forming osteoblast cells are coupled so that formation follows resorption."
8161,骨质疏松与其他疾病的根本不同之处在于病人根本不知道自己患上了骨质疏松。,What makes osteoporosis different from so many other conditions is that you may have no idea you even have it.
8161,大多数情况下，骨质疏松没有任何症状出现，病人等到发生骨折时才会发觉。,"In most cases, there aren't any symptoms until you break a bone."
8161,在冰上滑了一跤，手臂骨折，你根本不会往得病那方面想，因为这样的意外造成骨折，是完全可以理解的；但是当你撞在门框上就会折了胳膊，这就是向你敲响警钟了：你骨骼已经很脆弱，可能是得了骨质梳松。,"Break an arm when you slip on the ice, and you think nothing of the way it happened—you know that the trauma was significant enough to cause a break.But break an arm when you bump into the doorway, and it s a tip-off that your bones are much weaker than normal and that you may have osteoporosis."
8162,慢性的病痛需要由医生诊断，而髋部疼痛并不意味着你患了关节炎。,"Any chronic pain needs to be addressed by a doctor, but hip pain does not automatically mean you have arthritis."
8162,如果疼痛来自髋部的前面——腹股沟区域，那可能就是某种关节炎的信号了。,"If the pain is coming from the front of the hips, in the groin area, it's probably a sign of some form of arthritis."
8162,但如果是体侧感觉疼痛，那很可能就是肌腱炎或滑囊炎。治疗的方法有很多种，主要是消炎药和物理疗法。,"But if you’re experiencing some tenderness along the sides, your pain more likely stems from tendonitis or bursitis, which can be treated in a number of different ways, including anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy."
8163,对人施测取得的测验分数称为观察分数。,A test score obtained by a person is the observed score.
8163,此分数不确定是否为此人能力或表现的真实评价 。,It is not known whether this is a true assessment of this person’s ability or performance.
8163,测量误差可能会因测验指示、测量工具 、评分 、或是受测者情绪或生理状态而发生。,"Measurement error may occur because of the test directions, the instrumentation, the scoring, or the person’s emotional or physical state."
8163,因此 ，观察分数理论上是由受测者的真实分数以及误差分数组成。,"Thus, an observed score theoretically consists of the person’s true score and error score."
8164,关于过度训练的情况。,Overtraining concerns.
8164,这是损伤的外因。,These constitute extrinsic factors for injury.
8164,运动残疾常过度使用主要肢体或非假肢肢体，或截肢者使用替代假肢行走造成过度使用损伤。,Motor disabilities often result in either excessive use of a dominant or nonprosthetic limb or the use of alternative limbs for ambulation.
8165,影响残疾儿童全面的身体素质水平的各种因素包括：1.残疾的性质。2.,A variety of factors affect the overall fitness levels of children with a disability including: 1 The nature of the disability.2
8165,残疾的严重程度。3.,The severity of the disability.3
8165,与社会文化因素有关的过分保护和运动机能的减退。,Overprotection  and hypokinesis  associated with sociocultural factors.
8166,"更为灵敏的影像技术，包括软组织X线照相技术，超声波技术，CT和核磁共振影像技术都曾经用于研究儿童力量训练对肌肉大小的影响（Vrijens，1978; Mersch & Stoboy, 1989; Kamsay et al., 1990; Fukunaga et al., 1992)。","More sensitive im aging techniques, including soft tissue roentgenography, ultrasound, computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging have also been used to investigate the effects of strength training on muscle size in children."
8166,"在两项研究中 (Vrijens, 1978; Blimkie et al，1990)，只 有前者发现发育期前的男孩的力量有显著的增强，但无肌肉肥大的证据。","Two of these studies, of which only the former resulted in a significant increase in strength, found no evidence of muscle hypertrophy in preadolescent boys."
8166,但是，另外两项最新的研究报告发现抗阻训练引起发育期前的儿童的肌肉肥大。,"Two other recent studies, however, have reported resistance traininginduced muscle hypertrophy in preadolescents."
8166,"默施和施托博伊（Mersch & Stoboy, 1989)报告说，在两名双胞胎男孩中力量训练引起双膝等长伸展力量明显增长以及通过核磁共振确定的股四头肌横截面积加大。",Mersch and Stoboy (1989) reported significant strength training-induced increases in both knee extension isometric strength and quadriceps muscle cross-sectional area determined by magnetic resonance im aging in two preadolescent twin boys.
8167,后手翻动作快如闪电，需要亲身体验才能真正领会，所以动口不如动手，但我至少可以给你一些指点。,"Back handsprings are a lightning fast move that need to be experienced to really be understood, so describing how to do them is kind of artificial, but I can at least give you a few pointers."
8167,用力跳起，但不单单向上跳，而是既向上又向后跳。,"Jump hard, but don’t jump up; jump up and back."
8167,手臂随之尽快上摆，越过头顶向后摆。,"Coordinate your arms with the movement, swinging up, overhead and back as fast as you can."
8167,后背收紧成弓形，头部始终处于两臂之间，在地面上找个点放置双手。,"Arch your back tight and keep your head back between your arms, looking for a place to plant your hands."
8167,在发现这个点的同时，双腿也顺势上摆，惯性会完成其余的工作。,"When you find one, continue swinging your legs as momentum carries you over."
8168,前面引用的化石证据表明，我们人类祖先大约是在一百五十万至三百万年前，首次具备了长跑能力。,The fossil evidence cited previously suggests that our human ancestors first became equipped for distance running between 1.5 and 3.0 million years ago.
8168,原始人类进化分支与其他灵长类分离出来是在五百万到八百万年前。,"Now, the hominid evolutionary branch diverged from that of other primates 5 to 8 million ago."
8168,重点是，进化的力量，使得现代人类成了可以长跑的动物，也在我们最近的祖先进化中扮演了重要角色（相对而言）。,"The point is, then, that whatever Darwinian forces acted to make modern-day humans into distance running animals must have acted specifically on our closest ancestors (relatively speaking)."
8168,如果参考其他有氧耐力动物，这是显而易见的。,"When thinking about other aerobic endurance animals, this is evident, too."
8169,就女性而言，最重要的内部结构是子宫颈——向下开口，与阴道相通的子宫的颈部。宫颈在杯孕中发挥着重要作用。人体伸长宫颈让胚胎留在子宫里，然后宫颈缩短扩张，便于分娩生产。,"On the female side, one of the most important internal structures to think about is the cervix—the neck of the uterus that opens downward to the vagina-The cervix plays an important role in pregnancy; it lengthens to hold the fetus in the uterus and then shortens and dilates to allow laborand delivery."
8170,为了更好地预防损伤的发生，我们必须要知道，有相当部分的受伤儿童（32%)在过去一年曾在同一部位发生过损伤 。,"With a view to prevention, it is very important to realize that a substantial number of the injured children (32%) had experienced the injury before at the same site within the past year (Nielsen & Yde, 1988)."
8170,女孩更容易发生再损伤。,Girls had the highest risk of reinjury.
8170,踝关节扭伤与髌骨软化病是最容易复发的损伤。,"Ankle sprain and chondromalacia of the patella reoccurred most frequently (DeHaven & Lintner, 1986; Backx, 1991)."
8171,它带来的问题是能抑制瘦素分泌，因此人的大脑就无法收到已吃饱的信息。,"The problem is that HFCS inhibits leptin secretion, so you never get the message that you’re full."
8171,与此同时，饥饿激素的分泌则会源源不绝，所以，尽管胃里已有食物，大脑还是不断地收到饥饿的信息。,"And it never shuts off ghrelin, so, even though you have food in your stomach, you constantly get the message that you're hungry."
8171,这两种人体激素出现的反常现象产生了巨大影响，很大程度上造成了美国全民普遍身形壮大。,The double whammy on our hormones has contributed enormously to our collective enormity.
8171,许多美国女性每日摄入的热量，有多达50%来自色拉调料（其中含有高果糖玉米糖浆），原因显而易见。,"When you consider that many American women often obtain as much of 50 percent of their daily calories from salad dressing (which contains HFCS), you can see the problem."
8172,目前，通常将应力性骨折分为两类：(1) 机能不全骨折；（2)疲劳性骨折。,"At the present time, stress fractures can be appropriately divided into two general categories:(i) insufficiency fractures; and(ii) fatigue fractures of bone."
8172,此种分类方法最早由彭特科斯特等人提出 (Pentecost et al.，1994)。他指出：正常或生理性应力作用于结构缺陷的骨骼上时引起的是机能不全骨折；而过多的循环性应力作用于结构正常的骨骼上引起的是疲劳性骨折。,"This division, first suggested by Pentecost et al. (1964), describes an insufficiency fracture as being produced by normal or physiological stresses applied to bone with deficient structural characteristics, while a fatigue fracture occurs when excessive cyclical stress is applied to bone of normal structure."
8173,基于相同有氧功率水平，儿童要比成人在相同情况下付出更大的努力。,Based on similar levels of aerobic power children should be able to match adults in events that demand extended effort.
8173,可是，儿童有氧能力比预期的髙要低。,"However, the child is less of an aerobic performer than might be expected from the high V o 2max."
8173,能力的差异与儿童的机械效率低有关，特别是行走和跑步是如此。,"Differences in performance have been attributed to the mechanical inefficiency of children, especially in walking and running activities."
8174,但是，至今还没有开展两性之间以及青少年与成年人之间对同样训练计划引起肌肥大的比较研究。,"There are no studies to date, however, which permit a valid comparison between sexes of the relative hypertrophy responses to identical training programmes during adolescence, or between adolescents and adults."
8174,肌肥大现象的共性是，肌肉力量的增幅往往要大于相应的肌肉形态的增幅。,
8174,,"Whatever the hypertrophy response, the magnitude of this morphological adaptation is small in comparison to the reported strength gains."
8174,除了肌肉体积变化之外，一定还有其他因素参与了力量的增长过程。,Other factors besides changes in muscle size must also contribute to the strength gains.
8175,最后，有两个想法突然浮现在脑海中，关于为什么自行车运动在节奏与经济性这个问题上是反常的。,"And, finally, a couple of other ideas spring to mind as to why cycling may be an anomaly in this question of cadence and economy."
8175,首先，因为自行车是台机器，也许它以递增负荷运转时，影响到人类的肌肉功能。,"First, because the bicycle is a machine, maybe it operates outside of evolutionary forces that have influenced human muscle function."
8175,其次，或许这解释在某种程度上是事实，即自行车不允许你增加步幅，只有节奏。,"And, second, perhaps the explanation is somewhere in the fact that a bicycle does not permit you to increase stride length, only cadence."
8176,在过去的十几年里，类似迪查理的说法开启了新一轮关于灵活性——脚部的、腿部的和臀部的——的讨论。,"Over the past decade, voices like Dicharry’s have opened up a new discussion regarding the power of mobility—in the feet, legs, and hips."
8176,人们指出，为了恢复灵活性和弹性，跑者需要对脚部、腓肠肌、腿绳肌、股四头肌和臀部肌肉进行按摩，然后训练使用臀部和下脊椎保持良好的姿势。,"To restore mobility and elasticity, they say, runners need to spend time massaging their feet, calf muscles, hamstrings, quads, and hips, and then do exercises to develop and sustain good positions with the hips and lower spine."
8176,我们在这里所讨论的灵活性训练课程是包含在CFE计划中的，目的是通过功能性力量练习训练良好的肌肉控制方式，更好地使用腿部的弹性机能。,"A mobility program, like the one outlined here within the CFE model, trains good muscle recruitment patterns through functional strength exercises to make better use of the spring like elasticity that we can tap from our legs."
8177,然而，CPGs不应该与大脑运动中枢混淆，后者的功能是发出肌肉收缩的信号并有目的地控制肌肉活动。,"However, CPGs should not be confused with brain motor centers, which signal muscle contraction and control purposeful motor activity."
8177,它们有不同的任务。,Theirs is a different task.
8177,CPGs被分配给潜意识的特殊作用，是控制活动的节律和节奏。,CPGs are assigned the specific role of subconsciously controlling the rhythmicity and tempo of that activity.
8177,它们与来自大脑皮层的运动控制区域不同，我们可以随意指挥它们的活动。,They are distinct from motor control areas in the cerebral cortex that we can willfully command.
8178,在某种程度上，应用性研究的优势为基础性研究的弱势，反之亦然。,"To some extent, the strengths of applied research are the weaknesses of basic research, and vice versa.Considerable controversy exists in the literature on social science (e.g."
8178,有关到底研究应该要更基础性一点还是应用性一点，在社会科学(与身体活动心理学里一直都有争议。,", Creswell, 2009; Jewczyn, 2013) and physical activity (e.g., Christina, 1989) about whether research should be more basic or more applied."
8178,而生态效度旨在处理下列二个问题，研究参与者所知觉的研究环境是否和实验者原先的想法一致？,"This issue, labeled ecological validity, deals with two concerns: Is the research setting perceived by the research participant in the way intended by the experimenter?"
8178,研究的情境是否和真实情境有足够的相似度而能将研究的结果类推到真实的环境中？,Does the setting have enough of the real-world characteristics to allow generalizing to reality?
8179,我采用了一个衍生训练计划，包括基础训练阶段、坡度跑训 练阶段和速度训练阶段。,"I used a derivative plan that included a base-building phase, a hill phase, and a speed phase."
8179,训练计划规定每隔一周进行一次长距离慢跑训练，每次逐渐增加距离到32干米以上。,"The plan prescribed a long run every other week, which slowly increased to more than 20 miles."
8179,速度训练阶段包括一系列 1.6千米等距离间歇跑，每次训练最多为10组。,"The speed phase included a session of mile repeats, peaking with a total of more than 10×1 mile for a single workout."
8180,人类可以推动自己在l00m直线跑道上最快到多少？,What’s the very fastest that humans can propel themselves down a  100-meter straightaway?
8180,为了解决这一问题，研究人员绘制了不同比赛日期的短跑世界纪录，将点连接起来，推断未来，并试图得出结论。,"So, investigators plot world-record sprinting  times against race competition dates, connect the dots, extrapolate to the future, and attempt to draw conclusions."
8180,这个问题并不是微不足道的。,The issue is far from trivial.
8180,事实上，它可以从许多角度观察，数学、生理学、 社会学，甚至是哲学。,"Indeed, it can be viewed from a variety  of mathematical, physiological, sociological, and even philosophical perspectives."
8180,它直接关系着一些重大问题，像性别平等，基因工程伦理学， 以及人类的本质是什么。,"It has bearing on such weighty questions as sexual equality, ethics of genetic engineering, and the essence of what it means to be human."
8181,肌腱与韧带一同支撑着整个脊柱，每块椎骨有个孔，这些孔连成一线，形成了长长的管道，管道内含脊髓，由大脑基部向下一直延伸至脊柱末端。,"Tendons and ligaments hold the entire spine together, and an opening in each vertebra line up form a long hollow canal that houses the spinal cord from the base of the brain down the spine."
8181,脊髓中的小神经元通过椎骨间的间隙伸出脊柱。一旦脊柱受到过大扭力，椎间盘就会被挤出，这就造成了椎间盘突出，就好比用力压面圈，果冻会被挤出一样。,"Small nerves from the spinal cord jet out the spine through the space between the vertebrae.A bulging or herniated disc happens when too much torque is put on the spine and the disc bulges out, like pinching the doughnut so the jelly oozes out."
8182,就绦虫而言，它们生活在你的肠道中，能长到6米多长（大约两层楼高）。,"In the case of tapeworm, it lives in your intestine—and can grow up to twenty-two feet long (about the height of a two-story building)."
8182,寄生虫常见子不卫生的食物和水 源，并在全世界每年造成四百万例的痢 疾。这对每个人都不是个好消息（但这对 卫生纸厂来说也许是个好消息）。,Parasites are most common in unsanitary food and poor water supplies and are responsible for 4 billion cases of diarrhea around the world every year—bad news for everyone (except maybe Charmin).
8183,最早的加速度测量仪是在自动手表的基础上改良的，在加速度测量仪上转子是直接与手连接的。,The first accelerometers were based on a modified automatic wrist watch in which the rotor was directly connected to the hands.
8183,动作强度越大，转子旋转也就越快。,The stronger the movement the faster the turning of the rotor.
8183,在儿童中，佩戴在踝部的加速度测量仪在步行和 跑步时，其读数确实能够反映能量消耗量的差别，精度合适（Saris & Binkhorst，1977) 。,"For accelerometers worn on the ankle, readings do reflect the differences in energy turnover during walking and running in children with reasonable accuracy (Saris & Binkhorst, 1977)."
8184,甲状腺位于脖子后面的两侧基部 (见图11.2)。它呈蝴蝶状，接收到从脑垂体总部那里发出的信号之后，就会分泌甲状腺素。,"Located at the base of the neck on both sides (Figure 11.2), the butterfly- shaped thyroid gland produces, tada, thyroid hormone after receiving chemical signals from General Pituitary."
8184,"甲状腺素的主要功用是调节你的细胞的新陈代谢,也就是造成细胞生存、生长和死亡的化学变化。","The main function of the thyroid hormone is to regulate the metabolism of your cells, that is, the chemical changes in your cells that cause them to live, grow, and die."
8185,甲状腺位于脖子后面的两侧基部 (见图11.2)。它呈蝴蝶状，接收到从脑垂体总部那里发出的信号之后，就会分泌甲状腺素。,"Located at the base of the neck on both sides (Figure 11.2), the butterfly- shaped thyroid gland produces, tada, thyroid hormone after receiving chemical signals from General Pituitary."
8185,"甲状腺素的主要功用是调节你的细胞的新陈代谢,也就是造成细胞生存、生长和死亡的化学变化。","The main function of the thyroid hormone is to regulate the metabolism of your cells, that is, the chemical changes in your cells that cause them to live, grow, and die."
8186,第一式肩倒立深蹲最容易，第十式单腿深蹲最难。,"Step 1, the shoulderstand squat, is the easiest version of the movement; Step 10, the full one-leg squat, is the hardest variation."
8186,几乎人人都能做肩倒立深蹲，即使他的身体很弱。相反，几乎没人能够第一次就完成单腿深蹲，不管他多么健康、多么强壮。,"Almost everybody will be able to do shoulderstand squats straight away, no matter how weak or infirm they are; hardly anybody will be able to do one-leg squats on the first time of asking, no matter how fit or strong they are."
8186,我之所以构建这样的体系，就是为了让健身者做自己的教练，从而在没有器械辅助的情况下，慢慢到达能够做上20-50次单腿深蹲。,"The purpose of this structure is to allow the individual trainee—training alone as his own coach, and with no special equipment—to work his way up gradually to be able to do one-leg squats for sets of twenty to fifty reps."
8187,已知髙度的盒子配合分段人体测量器可以用于测量延伸身高。,A box of known height is part of the protocol for measuring some of the projected heights in conjunction with the segmometer.
8187,有提手口的长方形盒子能够让测试者依据受试者的不同身材随意转动。,The oblong box with slotted handholds enable the anthropometrist to turn the box to accommodate subjects of different size.
8187,此外，它可以当做座位或者让受试者站在上面，便于测量。盒子还可以让检测者站在上面测量身材高大受试者的伸展身高和肩峰间距。,"In addition to providing a place for seating or elevating standing subjects for convenience of measurement, the box also serves as a step for the anthropometrists who may stand on it to obtain stretch stature or biacromial breadth in tall subjects."
8188,戴维斯并未对此差别进行解释。,The discrepancy is not discussed by Davies.
8188,伊卡和藤永测量的是手臂的屈肌力量，而戴维斯测量的是小腿三头肌。,Ikai and Fukunuga measured strength in the arm flexors and Davies the triceps surae muscle.
8188,差异可能就是由此产生的，还可能是测量最大自主收缩力量和肌肉横截面积的方法上的差异引起的。,"The discrepancy may be due to this, and/or to methodological differences in the assessment of either maximal voluntary force or CSA of the muscles involved."
8189,在运动肌肉中，Po2和pH值较低，而乳酸水平较高。,"In exercising muscle, Po2 and pH are low and lactate concentrations are high."
8189,伤口的内环境具有类似的条件。,Similar conditions can be found in the interior milieu of wounds.
8189,正在愈合的伤口特征是形成新毛细血管和胶原蛋白。大量研究人员对pH值和呼吸气体浓度的变化可能对促生长作用进行了研究。,"The healing wound is characterized by new capillary and collagen formation, and a number of investigators have focused on possible growth-promoting effects of the changes in pH and respiratory gas concentrations."
8189,在组织水平上，伤口愈合和运动引起的合成代谢之间是否存在着共同的机制？,Might there be common mechanisms at the tissue level linking wound healing with exercise-induced anabolism?
8190,肥胖的少年利用运动来减肥能够增强自尊和社交的自信心。,The obese adolescent who uses exercise to lose weight may improve in self-esteem and social confidence.
8190,依据成年人的模式，很可能体力活动可以缓解压力、焦虑和抑郁，这些都是青少年人群的主要问题。,"It is possible, based on adult models, that physical activity can help relieve feelings of stress, anxiety and depression, major problems for the teenage population."
8190,"参加体育活动能够不同程度提高自我观念 (self-concept)，提高教学的协作效果 (teaching cooperation)和自我约束的能力 (self-discipline),可以预防青少年的不良行为（delinquency)和提高学习成绩（Segrave， 1983; Sonsstroem, 1984; Kirkendall, 1986) 。","Participation in sports has been variously promoted as a means of improving self-concept, teaching cooperation and self-discipline, preventing juvenile delinquency, and improving academic performance (Segrave, 1983; Sonstroem, 1984; Kirkendall, 1986)."
8191,我们的目标是要评估经过挑选的有关波特兰和查特曼教练生涯的新闻报道，来了解在故事情节中，异性恋主义和新自由主义意识形态是如何展现 的。,Our goal was to evaluate selected news coverage from the coaching careers of Portland and Chatman to understand how heterosexual and neoliberalist ideology manifested in storylines.
8191,我们不会试图分析所有有关这些教练的报道，而是会选择性地分析一些主流新闻媒体的报道，如ESPN、《纽约时报》和其他有影响力的或者流传度比较高的信源，以及来自他们执教过的大学的信息。,"We did not seek to analyze all coverage of these coaches but instead chose for analysis coverage from major news outlets, such as ESPN, The ~Ne<w York Times, and other influential or high-circulation sources, and from the universities at which they coached."
8191,我们总共阅读了45 篇有关查特曼和5 0篇有关波特兰的故事，因为波特兰的职业生涯比查特曼更长。,"In total, we read 45 stories about Chatman and 50 about Portland, whose career lasted far longer than Chatman's."
8192,儿童下肢损伤的常见部位之一是股骨远端骨骺（Grana，1990)。,"One of the most common locations of lower extremity injury in children is the distal femoral epiphysis (Grana, 1990)."
8192,篮球和足球急转动作时强大的扭转应力，以及接触性运动中屈膝外翻应力常是导致股骨远端骨骺损伤的原因。,This injury is often the result of a severe torsional stress that may be produced in a cutting movement observed in such sports as basketball and soccer or a valgus force directed at the flexed knee often seen in contact sports.
8192,此种力量或撞击在青少年中常导致骨骺骨折，而非成年人中常见的内侧副韧带损伤，则是因为青少年靭带的强度比邻近的骺板和关节软骨大。,"The force or impact usually results in a fracture through the epiphyseal plate instead of a sprained medial collateral ligament more commonly seen in adults.As opposed to the adult sprain, an epiphyseal fracture is seen in children because the knee ligament of the child is stronger than the adjac­ ent femoral physeal plate and articular cartilage."
8193,然而，CPGs不应该与大脑运动中枢混淆，后者的功能是发出肌肉收缩的信号并有目的地控制肌肉活动。,"However, CPGs should not be confused with brain motor centers, which signal muscle contraction and control purposeful motor activity."
8193,它们有不同的任务。,Theirs is a different task.
8193,CPGs被分配给潜意识的特殊作用，是控制活动的节律性和节奏。,CPGs are assigned the specific role of subconsciously controlling the rhythmicity and tempo of that activity.
8193,它们与来自大脑皮层的运动控制区域不同，我们可以随意指挥它们的活动。,They are distinct from motor control areas in the cerebral cortex that we can willfully command.
8194,在不同年龄时出现不同的节奏定型动作，并且在不同年龄时某些节奏定型动作突出。,The different rhythmical stereotypies appear and peak at different ages.
8194,在婴儿1岁末时，节奏定型动作的数量增加了，但是实际出现的频率却减少了。,The number of patterns increases while the actual frequency of expression declines toward the end of the first year.
8194,人们认为，这些节奏定型动作是固有动作的不成熟感知动作的表现，它们为协调动作的发展提供了基础。,It has been proposed that these rhythmical stereotypies are manifestations of immature sensorimotor integration of inherent motor patterns and that they provide the temporal substrata for coordinated movements.
8195,结果应该以病例定义的方式说明（如：国际疾病伤害及死因分类标准第十版的编码），以及描述数据如何取得 。是否为医院纪录、死亡证明 、身体检查或自陈式报告。,"The outcome should be identified by a case definition (e.g., ICD-version 10 codes) and a description of how data were obtained, whether from hospital records, death certificates, physical exams, or self-reports."
8195,作者应对疾病结果提供一个病例定义，以引导研究者有关疾病结果的状态分类。,Disease outcomes should have a case definition that the authors use to guide the researchers in the classification of the outcome status.
8196,茎突间线（mid-stylion line)。,Mid-stylion line.
8196,受试者右侧肘关节屈曲，手掌向上。,"The subject flexes at the elbow and presents the right wrist, palmar surface upward."
8196,1.在掌侧，用左拇指和食指将软尺围绕手腕，将尺子的近端边缘固定在尺骨和桡骨茎突最末端。,1 Wrap the tape around the wrist pinning it distal to the stylion ulnare and stylion radiale on the dorsal surface with your left thumb and second digit.
8196,2.在腕部掌侧中部尺子的近端边缘画一条短线。,2 Draw a small line on the palmar surface at the proximal border of the tape in the midportion of the wrist.
8196,3.放开尺子，估计受试者手腕的中部并在上面与前面的线画一个十字交叉。,3 Release the tape and estimate the mid-portion of the subject's wrist and make a cross on the previous line.
8196,4.核查该十字交叉是否位于手腕中部，并同指尖在一条线上，指尖是指在手 和手指同时伸展时第三指骨的最远端。,"4 Check that the cross is in the mid-portion and in line with the dactylion, the most distal point on the terminal phalanx III when the hand is extended with the fingers together."
8197,角膜是有弹性的，能保护晶状体不受擦伤。,The resilient cornea protects the lens from getting scratched.
8197,晶状体会把我们看到的影像翻转投射到视网膜。晶状体接触过阳光，就会产生白内障。,"The lens, which is prone to cataracts from sun exposure, projects a lipped version of what we really see onto our retina."
8197,而如是青光眼，一种负责排干眼内液体的小梁就会关闭，造成液体堆积和液体压力增大，从而损坏视神经。,"In glaucoma, the trabecula that usually drains fluid from the eye can dose, causing a buildup of fluid and pressure of that fluid that then damages the optic nerve."
8197,在眼睛后面的膨胀突出的脂肪会使眼睛更突出。,Fat bulging behind the eyes makes them seem more prominent and attractive.
8198,FFB是从密度、水分和骨骼矿物质的测量进行计算的（公式33.2)。,"FFB was computed from density, water and bone mineral measurements (eqn 33.2)."
8198,将H2/R、体重和性别作为独立变量进行分析。,"The analysis was carried out utilizing H2/R, body weight and gender as independent variables."
8198,"正如预料的那样，两种仪器估测FFB的精度是一样的,只是在所使用的公式方面有一点的不同。","As expected, the precision of estimating FFB was similar for both instruments, with slight variation noted in the actual prediction equations as indicated below."
8199,颈前深蹲将杠铃放置在肩膀上方。,Front SquatPlace the barbell on the front of your shoulders and across your chest.
8199,保持重心在身体的前部，这项练习会比空蹲调动更多的股四头肌力量。,"With the weight racked in front of your body, you’ll engage more of the quads than you do in an air squat."
8199,在整个颈前深蹲的练习中，重点使用臀部力量，向上起运动员时钟：生物学和时间因素如何影响运动表现注意肘部发力。,"Throughout the front squat, concentrate on driving with the hips and powering upward with your elbows."
8200,同时，巨噬细胞从外来细胞那里获取信息，以便免疫系统能够认识它。,"At the same time, the macrophage takes down information about the foreign cells so that the immune system can recognize it."
8200,这一信息其实就是把这种细菌列在你身体里的“通缉要犯”的名单上。巨噬细胞由此让别的细胞知道该攻击什么。,"Essentially, that information is what puts the bacteria on your body’s Most Wanted List, as the macrophages let other cells know what to attack."
8200,所有这些信息被传递给免疫细胞之后，后援免疫细胞开始到达感染现场，他们会寻找信号——嫌疑犯照片——来确认并除去有害细菌。,"As all of this information is being relayed, the backup immune cells are starting to arrive on the scene of the infection.They'll look for the code—the mug shot—to identify and obliterate harmful bacteria."
8201,使用决定系数诠释相关系数时，亩以明显了解相当程度的相关是达到大量共同变异量的前提 。,"When we use the coefficient of determination to interpret correlation coefficients, it becomes apparent that a rather substantial relationship is needed to account for a great amount of common variance."
8201,若要说明另一项测验中一半的变异量，相关系数为.7 1有其必要性；而相关系数.90 只能够解释另一项测验中81%的变异量。,"A correlation of .71 is required to account for just half the variance in the other test, and a correlation of .90 accounts for only 81%."
8201,在一些预测学业成就的标准化测验中，相关系数经常是相当低的，通常落在.40。,"In some of the standardized tests used to predict academic success, correlations are generally quite low, often around .40."
8201,从决定系数可以看出在相关系数为.40时，只能够解释16%影响学业成就的因素；因此，仍有大量未解释的变异量 。,"You can see by the coefficient of determination that a correlation of .40 accounts for only 16% of the factors contributing to academic success; therefore, unexplained variance is substantial."
8202,当女性乳房发现肿块时，常常会产生最大的健康问题。,The primary health concern —cancer—usually starts when a woman (or her partner) finds a lump in her breast.
8202,这种肿块约有80%是囊肿，不会癌变。,About 80 percent of these lumps are cysts—benign lumps that do not become cancerous.
8202,但是在囊肿被初次发现时，很难区分它与癌症之间的差别（直到做了活体组织检査后才能判断确定）。,But they're hard to differentiate from cancers when they're first found (until a biopsy is performed).
8202,在月经来潮前，囊肿会变大变软，绝经后就停止生长。,"Cysts, which stop with menopause, are larger and more tender just before periods."
8202,激素含童失衡是一种可能的原因。为了防治囊肿，应避免食用含中基黄嘌呤的食品，比如咖啡、红茶和可乐。,"A hormonal imbalance is the likely cause; to help prevent cysts, avoid methylxanthines, which are found in coffee, black tea, and colas."
8202,（第11章将对乳腺癌作进一步讨论。）,(See more on breast cancer in Chapter 12.)
8203,来自呼吸仓研究的结果说明，相关系数甚至更高 (r= 0.92) (Schutz et al，1988)。,"Results from a respiration chamber study showed even better results (r = 0.92) (Schütz et al., 1988)."
8203,在 25 项以上的研究中，采用不同技术（从心率记录到问卷调查）来验证Caltrac加速度测量仪的有效 性，结果表明Caltrac的仪器间的变异性很低，在有控制的实验室条件下其有效性很好。,"In over 25 studies using different techniques ranging from H R recording to questionnaire to validate the Caltrac, that the interinstrument variability of the instrument was low and its validity was good under controlled laboratory conditions."
8203,用三轴向加速度测量仪取代单一平 面的加速度测量仪的初步结果表明，能够 稍稍提高对每天能量消耗量的评估。,Initial results with the use of triaxial accelerometer instead of the single-plane instruments suggest a little better estimate of daily energy turnover.
8204,抗胆减能药物（anticholinergic agents) 由于迷走兴奋能增加安静时支气管活动张力，所以抗胆碱能药物像阿托品一样能使一些人的支气管扩张。,"Anticholinergic agents.Since vagal input increases resting bronchomotor tone, anti­cholinergic agents like atropine may cause bronchodilatation in some people."
8204,溴化异丙托品 (ipratropium bromide) (Atrovent)是阿托品的一种季铵衍生物，当用定量-剂量吸入器吸入时，吸收量很少，因此阿托品样副作用（口干，视觉问题等）减少了。,"Ipratropium bromide (Atrovent) is a quartemary ammonium derivative of atropine, and when taken by metered-dose inhaler, is absorbed only poorly, thus reducing atropine-like side-effects (dry mouth, visual problems, etc.)."
8204,溴化异丙托品对某些患者有用，但预防运动性哮喘的作用稍差（Lemanske & Henke，1988）。,"Ipratropium bromide has become a useful agent for some patients, but has only moderate effectiveness in preventing EIA (Lemanske & Henke, 1989)."
8205,体内的入侵者被巨噬细胞吞下并处理掉，巨噬细胞送出的化学信息（细胞活类素）吸引着别的白血球。,An invader into the body is ingested and processed by macrophages that send chemical messages (cytokines) that attract other white blood cells.
8205,（这种细胞分裂素有的时候会引起发烧、头疼和肌肉疼。,"(The cytokines can sometimes also cause fever, headache; and muscle pain.)"
8205,）做出反应的白细胞紧贴着巨噬细胞以获取更多关于入侵细菌的信息，并生成一种特殊的防御机制——把T细胞和B细胞召集到被感染区。,Responding white cells attach to the macrophage so they can learn more about the invaders and develop specialized defense mechanisms—in the form of calling T cells and B cells to the area.
8205,T细胞直接杀死入侵细菌或者帮助调整免疫系统的反应。,The T cells directly kill the invader or help coordinate the immune response.
8205,B细胞制造抗体像子弹一样摧毁入侵细菌。,The B cells create antibodies that act like bullets to destroy the invaders.
8205,当他们完成任务，多余的白细胞将会杀死它们自己(细胞自杀机制），以使它们不会误杀我们自身健康的细胞，造成自体免疫性疾病。,"When done, the excess white blood cells kill themselves (apoptosis) so that they won't kill our own healthy cells by mistake and cause an autoimmune disease."
8206,在第7章中你会看到，适当的统计分析需要具备统计考验力(power)。,"As you will see in chapter 7, appropriate statistical analysis demands statistical power."
8206,考验力受到样本大小的影响;较大的样本大致上会具有较强的考验力，来辨别关联性或差异性。,Power is influenced by sample size; larger samples generally have more power to detect relationships or differences.
8206,当研究者所计画的研究是将原有单位（前一个例子中的班级或学校）分派到不同处置时，就必须提早考虑适当的分析单位对于考验力的影响。,"In planning studies in which intact units (classes or schools in the previous example) are assigned to a treatment, the effect of the appropriate unit of analysis on power should be considered early."
8207,我们也以较哲学性的讨论科学与求知的方法，提出从事研究的另类方式。,We also present alternative approaches for doing research relative to a more philosophical discussion of science and ways of knowing.
8207,尤其是，我们探讨使用质性研究、实地研究，与以内省的方法作为回答研究问题的策略。而非依赖传统的科学典范架构作为研究问题探讨的唯一方法。,"In particular, we address qualitative research, the use of field studies, and methods of introspection as strategies for answering research questions instead of relying on the traditional scientific paradigm as the only approach to research problems."
8208,可信性被用来决定研究是否具一定水准。,Trustworthiness is used to determine whether the study was competent.
8208,伦理问题，也就是研究如何进行的相关议题(例如确实性、可转换性、可靠性、可确认性)，在决定可信性时扮演重要的角色。,"Ethical issues are important in determining trustworthiness, as are issues related to how the study was conducted (i.e., credibility, transferability, dependability, confirmability)."
8208,"资料搜集与分析的过程中，我们会运用许多方法来提升资料与结论的品质，包括延长相处时间、回首来时路、丰富、深度描绘、研究偏见的厘清、三角检证、负面案例检证、成员检证与对同侪简报,在单一研究中并非所有方法都会用到，但提升读者对于结论的信心而使用大部分方法是很常见的，也可提升将研究结果移转到其他情境的信心。","Many techniques are used during data collection and analysis to enhance the quality of the data and the conclusions.Among these are prolonged engagement, keeping an audit trail, providing a thick and rich description, clarifying researcher bias, triangulation, negative case checking, member checking, and peer debriefing.Not all of these can be used in one study, but using most or many is common to enhance the faith that readers can place in the conclusions and the transferability to other settings."
8209,然而值得一提的是，若不是因为Muhammad Ah在拳击上的成就，他也不会有如此大的影响。,It is important to note that Muhammad Ah would not have had such an impact were it not for his boxing ability.
8209,因此，“拆解”跟“组合”对于历史学家而言，是同等重要的。,"Thus, it is critical for historians to be aware of both splitting and lumping."
8209,体育运动史学家需要能够获得证据、具批判性地确定其可信性，并了解这证据是如何影响我们对现象的理解。,"A sport historian needs to be able to obtain evidence, critically ascertain its trustworthiness, and then understand how it adds to our greater understanding of the phenomenon being investigated."
8209,这一部份揭露的是：历史学家所追求去获得更多了解的方式，与研究人员所采取何种理论观点，有着直接的关系。,"As this section will reveal, the way historians have sought to gain a greater understanding is directly related to the theoretical perspectives taken by researchers."
8210,荷尔蒙和生殖疾病影响10%的女性。,The hormonal and reproductive disease affects 10 percent of women.
8210,它会导致肥胖、经期不规律、痤疮，需要打蜡剃胡须，和/或导致血糖升高，不良胆固醇（和低健康胆固醇）升高，或血压（代谢综合征）升高。,"It causes obesity, irregular periods, acne, the need to wax your mustache, and/or ele¬vations in blood sugar, lousy cholesterol (and low healthy cholesterol), or blood pressure (metabolic syndrome)."
8210,口服避孕药可以有效治疗这些症状，但如果你想怀孕，药物二甲双胍和克罗米特（克罗米芬）可以有所帮助。,"Oral contraceptives are very effective at treating symptoms, but if youVe trying to get pregnant, the medications metformin and Clo- mid (clomiphene) can help."
8211,每天睡大约7个小时可以对大脑和心脏产生深远影响，能让你年轻3岁。,Getting about 7 hours of sleep a night can make a profound difference on your brain and your heart and make you up to three years younger.
8211,相反，缺乏睡眠会让你大脑注意力不集中，令你更加疲倦，让你吃得更多，发生意外的危险增高。,"Lack of sleep makes you less mentally aware and more fatigued, causes you to eat more, and places you at a higher risk of accidents."
8211,如果你患有睡眠呼吸暂停综合征，这说明你无法经历快速动眼期睡眠和慢波睡眠，不能通过睡眠完全恢复精力。,"But if you have sleep apnea, it means you're simply not getting enough of the rejuvenating REM and slow-wave sleep."
8212,大范围伸展的夹子。,Wide spreading caliper.
8212,大范围伸展的夹子是用于测量胸廓的厚度的，但是，人体测量器或者宽范围的滑动夹子带有内弯的双臂可以作为替代之用。,"The large wide spreading caliper (Siber-Hegner, GPM) is the instrument of choice for anteroposterior chest depth.However, anthropometers or wide sliding calipers with recurved branches may be used as a substitute."
8212,新型的Campbell 10型夹子有备用的橄榄枝样的指示器，用于测量胸廓的宽度。,The new Campbell Caliper 10 has optional olive-tipped pointers that attach for this purpose.
8213,第二部分的案例研究从一个广泛的维度考察了个人体育项目中英雄的坠落以及团队体育项目中当个人成为焦点而团队被忽略的情形。,Case studies in the second section consider a wide range of offenses that have brought down heroes in individual sports where the athlete becomes a brand and where responsibilities to team are not featured.
8213,安德鲁•比林斯考察了高尔夫巨星泰戈尔• 伍兹在他的婚姻和性关系中是如何“粗鲁着地”，并且由于辩解书策略的错误行为导致问题复杂化的概要。,"Andrew Billings examines the headline case of how golf great Tiger Woods landed ""in the rough"" with his marriage and sexual relations and compounded this by mishandling strategies of apologia."
8213,李•哈林顿和金•施梅尔通过安德鲁• 阿加西对形象、重构与忏悔的协商来图解“网球名流的潮涨潮落”。,"Lee Harrington and Kim Schimmel chart the ""tides of tennis celebrity"" in Andre Agassi's negotiations of image, reconstruction, and confession."
8213,林茜•米恩对径赛明星玛丽安•琼斯的研究展示了传媒对于人们理解她首先作为“黄金女孩”，然后通过个人关系中的欺骗行为和服用有助于提高成绩的药物的框架演变史中性别和种族等问题所起到的作用。,"Lindsey Mean's study of track star Marion Jones shows the role that gender and race played in the evolution of media framing her first as ""Golden Girl"" and then as flawed and fraud in her personal relations and drug-aided performance."
8214,★老年斑:能够漂白的退色素乳霜可以淡化色斑的颜色。,★ Liver spots: Fading creams that bleach can soften their color.
8214,★眼袋：眼袋是遗传性的，是由眼睹周围的脂肪堆积造成。,★ Eye bags: They're hereditary and caused by a collection of fat around your eyes.
8214,缺乏睡眠和酒精摄人过量会加剧这一现象。,Lack of sleep and too much alcohol exaggerate the problem.
8215,每天应该至少吃一把坚果。,Eat at least one handful of nuts a day.
8215,坚果是健康脂肪和健康蛋白质的理想来源。坚果还富含类黄酮化合物，这是一种解毒剂。,"Nuts are an excellent source of both healthful fats and healthful protein; they also can be concentrated sources of flavonoids, an antioxidant (see below)."
8215,“爱荷华州保健调查”和三次其他调查表明，每日食用28克坚果，会使心脏病发生的几率减少20%至60%。,"In the Iowa Nurses Study and three other studies, one ounce of nuts a day decreased the incidence of heart disease between 20 and 60 percent."
8216,HDL的含量是越高越好，因此一名55岁女性的HDL含量60mg/dl与39mg/dl相比，能年轻4岁。实际上，你应该确保在每日摄入的热量中，健康脂肪要占到大约25%。,"When it comes to HDL, higher is better—so an HDL level of 60 versus one of 39 will make the average fifty-five-year-old woman four years younger In fact, you should make sure that healthy fat makes up about 25 percent of your daily calories."
8216,植物和类黄酮化合物，还有刚才告诉你的窍门都已被证实能提升HDL含量。,"Vegetables and flavonoids, in addition to the tricks we told you above, have also been shown to raise HDL."
8217,通常 ，若效果量无法服从一样的形态，也许可以考虑加入其他的特征到模型里（例如：发表或未发表的研究）。,"Often, the ESs that do not follow the same pattern may suggest other characteristics that can be added to the model (e.g., published vs. unpublished studies)."
8217,除此之外，某些效果量也许是离群值（非代表性的分数）。,"Moreover, some ESs may represent outliers (unrepresentative scores)."
8217,在这两个情况下，离群值技术的使用对于确认这些效果量就有帮助。,"In either case, the use of outlier techniques is helpful in identifying these ESs."
8218,李克特氏类型的量表最大的好处是意见反馈选择范围更大，而不是像总是或从不、是或否这种回应。,"A principal advantage of scaled responses such as the Likert type is that they permit a wider choice of expression than responses such as always or never, or yes or no."
8218,使用五点、七点、或更多间隔有助于增加工具的信度。,"The five, seven, or more intervals may help increase the reliability of the instrument."
8218,"（对李克特氏量表、语意差异量表、以及其他量表更全面的信息请参见Edwards,1957, Nunnaly, 1978.)","(For more comprehensive information concerning the Likert-type scale, semantic differential scale, and other scales, see Edwards, 1957, and Nunnaly, 1978.)"
8219,"“虽然许多过程可以在历史中辨别出来，但将历史本身视作一个过程来讨论，又是另一回事。《从仪式到纪录——现代运动的本质》发表在理论尚于形成阶段的时期中，在当时，受到现在后现代学者所鄙视的发展叙说，还处于一个模糊的阶段”(2001, p. 13)。Booth虽然曾高度赞扬《从仪式到纪录——现代运动的本质》这本书，不过也指出Guttmann的研究仅提供了一个“现代化的进程和现代化本质的有限概念，且缺乏足够的政治和辩证分析”（2001，p.22)。","“While many processes are identifiable in history,” wrote Howell, “it is another thing altogether to understand history itself as a process. From Ritual to Record was written at a time of grand theorizing, when the grand narratives of development that postmodernist scholars now disdain were clearly in vogue” (2001, p. 13), Booth generally had high praise for the book, but claimed that Guttmann’s work provides a “limited conceptualization of the process of modernization and the nature of modernity” and “lacks adequate political and dialectical analyses” (2001, p. 22)."
8220,图3.1中显示了我在2013年 10月 24 日进行CrossFit “ met-con” 训练时的心率数据。,"Figure 3.1 shows the heart rate profile of a CrossFit “met-con” workout that I did on October 24, 2013."
8220,“ met-con” 是 “ metabolic conditioning” 的缩写，意味着在这个测试过程中持久力和耐力会达到最大值》这是 一组高重复性训练，包括4 组立卧撑跳和哑铃抓举，重复次数按照 24— 12—6— 24安排。,"“Met-con” is short for “metabolic conditioning,” a term indicating that stamina and endurance are pushed hard in the session.It was a high-repetition workout consisting of 4 sets of burpees and dumbbell snatches, in this repetition pattern: 24-12-6-24."
8220,这组训练中不包含跑步。,There was no running involved.
8221,例证总是与坠落的体育名流这一主题相关联。在有限的事实中，这些个体能被放置到任意数量的戏剧性的事件里。,Exemplification relates to the subject of fallen sports celebrities in that individuals can be situated within any number of dramatic occurrences given a limited set of facts.
8221,相反，尽管它们在故事中有很多相同的属性，那些不适合叙事的事件仍然可能被排除在外。,"Conversely, those who do not fit a narrative may be left out even when they share as many similar attributes as those included in the story."
8222,随机试验的焦点在于个人层次的健康改变，又称为临床试验 (clinical trials)。,Randomized trials that are focused on changing health at the individual level are referred to as clinical trials.
8222,由于拒绝提供能获致健康效益的介入处方是不合法的。因此，与身体活动有关的随机试验通常会提供对照组某种形式的身体活动。但该活动与介入的活动不同，无法提供相同的生理效果。或借此比较不同种类处方的效果。,"Because denying treatment that is known to cause health benefits is illegal, randomized trials for physical activity often provide a form of physical activity to the comparison group that does not have the same biological effect as the intervention treatment provided to the intervention group, or that compares different types of treatment."
8223,灵活性训练包括改善动作范围和建立新的、理想的运动模式。,"Mobility practice involves improving range of motion and establishing new, ideal motor patterns."
8223,这项训练可帮助跑者克服那些制约良好体态的限制因素和问题，如紧张的臀部或受限的脚踝运动范围。,It does this by overcoming the restrictions and problems—like tight hips or compromised ankle range of motion—that may prevent good body position.
8223,训练内容包括改善日常习惯，而且更关注非跑步时的动作和一天的日常姿势，如怎么站立、走路和坐。,"Pursuing these targets may include changing daily habits, requiring that closer attention be paid to non-running movements and positions throughout the day, such as how you stand, walk, and sit."
8224,运动员群体的流行数据是有限的。,Prevalence figures in athletic populations are limited.
8224,首先，有关进食障碍问题的研究是非常少的。,"First, very few studies have addressed the issue of eating disorder prevalence in athletes."
8224,其次，有关该问题研究的样本非常小并且有限。,"Second, of those studies that have attempted to address this issue, most have had very small and restricted sample sizes."
8224,最后，大多数的研究没有采用严格的DSM-III-R标准。,"Finally, most of these studies have failed to use the strict DSM-III-R criteria."
8224,最后一点是最重要的，因为很多运动员有易饿症的行为，但并不符合DSM神经性易饿症的诊断标准。,"This final point is an important one, for there may be many athletes who demonstrate bulimic behaviour, yet who do not meet the DSM criteria for bulimia nervosa."
8225,"不同的测量有不同的目的,因此也有不同的效度。","There are different purposes for different measures.Consequently, there are different kinds of validity."
8225,"我们将讨论四种基本的效度类型:逻辑效度(logical validity)、内容效度、 效标效度 , 以及构念效度 。","We consider four basic types of validity: logical, content, criterion, and construct."
8225,"虽然我们将逻辑效度列为一个独立的效度类型,但美国心理学会与美国教育研究学会认为逻辑效度是内容效度的特例。","Although we list logical validity as a separate type of validity, the American Psychological Association and the American Educational Research Association consider logical validity a special case of content validity."
8226,20世纪90年代，细井获得了大量的媒体报道，在小众杂志的照片和短标题中出现频率最高。,"Hosoi received a lot of media coverage in the 1980s in niche magazines, most frequently in photographs and short captions."
8226,当他在接受采访时，例如在1 9 8 5 年4 月发行的《脱粒机》中，谈论的焦点主要是滑板，话题通常是他最爱的技巧、有影响力的滑手、他使用何种设备等。,"When he was interviewed, as in the April 1985 issue of Thrasher, the focus was primarily on skateboarding, with such topics as Hosoi's favorite tricks, influential skaters, and what type of equipment he used."
8226,大多数话题明显是用来促进滑板行业发展的。,Most topics were clearly used to promote skateboarding.
8227,简而言之，在从体育名流的英雄到恶棍的转变中，数十年来关于阿加西的生活故事的媒体建构最好被描述为：从英雄到恶棍到英雄再生到… …什么呢？,"In short, in a volume on the hero-to-villain arc in sports celebrity, the decades-long media construction of Agassi's life story might best be described as hero-to-villain-to-reborn-hero-to ... what?"
8227,承认吸毒似乎把他重塑成一个恶棍，事实上确实有一些同僚运动员是这样谴责他的，但这不是关于《开放》占主导地位的媒体回应（戴假发和服用冰毒一样被提到），在撰写本章时他的政客地位似乎完好无损。,"The admission of drug use would seem to recast him as a villain, and indeed some fellow players condemned him as such, but this has not been the dominant media response to Open's revelations (again, the hairpiece was as remarked upon as was the meth use), and as of this writing his statesman status appears intact."
8227,《开放》自身的暗示既没有引起英雄的比喻，也没有引起恶棍的比喻— 相反，安德鲁把他的人生旅程讲述为从没有人到某个人。,"Open's own suggestion invokes neither the villain nor hero trope—rather, Andre has storied his life journey as from no one-to-someone."
8227,这确实是一个不同的叙事模式。,A different narrative arc indeed.
8228,"儿童和青少年的磷酸果糖激酶（PFK）活性低于成年人这一事实也支持上面的研究结果（Eriksson etal., 1973; Eriksson, 1980）。PFK是调节糖醇解的一个主要的酶。","Consistent with these observations is thefact that the activity of the enzyme PFK, a major regulator of glycolysis, is lower in children and adolescents than in adults (Eriksson et al., 1973; Eriksson, 1980)."
8228,"除此之外，儿童和青少年根本无法产生或承受文献所报道的成年人那样高的酸中毒（acidosis）水平（血液PH值增高或碱基减少）（Kindermann et al., 1975; Metejkova et al., 1980; Bar-Or, 1985）。","In addition, children and adolescents are not able to generate or sustain levels of acidosis (as indicated by blood pH or base excess) as high as those reported in adults (Kindermann et al., 1975; Metejkova et al., 1980; Bar-Or, 1985)."
8229,我们不得不成天与有毒物质生活在一起，这正是当今现代化社会高速发展的一个特点。有毒物质包括污染、一氧化碳和早上飞驰而过的带音响的摩托车。,"It’s just part of today’s society that we’ll be exposed to such toxic substances as pollution, carbon monoxide, and some morning-drive DJs."
8229,然而，我们是有办法完全避免接触许多室内污染物的，例如氡、石棉和霉菌。,"But you can take steps to avoid being exposed to many indoor pollutants like radon, asbestos, and mold."
8230,把我们所有的防护细胞储存在一个区域是不明智的，所以骨髓（包在骨头里面），会产生新的免疫细胞加入战斗。,"It would be unwise to house ail of our protector cells in one area, so the bone marrow—the inner portion of the bone throughout the body一 produces the young generations of immune cells that go to battle."
8230,尤其是B细胞 ，它能够通过产生一种从细菌和被病毒感染的细胞的侧面挤进去的小分子抗体，对感染做出反应。,"In particular, the B cells respond to infections by creating antibodies—the small molecules that ram themselves into the side of bacteria and virus-infected cells."
8230,一旦病菌的保护罩被攻破，这些细胞就像吹起来的气球一样会爆裂，一种叫免疫球蛋白的蛋白质就会在白血球的引导下钩住被感染细胞并杀死它们。,"Once their protective shields are broken, these cells burst like swollen balloons.Small protein bullets called immunoglobulins work under the direction of white blood cells to hook up to infected cells and kill them."
8231,我们此处提到的抑郁，可不是指你在全美棒球联赛彩票中输了20美元后产生的情绪。,"When we say depression, we're not talking about how you feel after losing twenty bucks in the office Super Bowl pool."
8231,抑郁是指更为被动的长期负面情感状态，与心脏病联系很密切。,A more passive negative emotional state over the long term is strongly associated with heart disease.
8231,事实上有统计表明，抑郁症患者得心脏病的可能性是正常人的4倍。一种无助感似乎能击垮免疫系统。,"In fact, people with depression are statistically four times more likely to have a heart attack than people who are not depressed, A feeling of helplessness appears to weaken the immune system."
8232,参与者样本可能是从较大的群体或母群体 (population) 中随机选择出来的。,"The sample of participants might be randomly selected from some larger group, or a population."
8232,举例来说，如果你所在的学院或大学有10000位学生，你 可以随机地选取200位来进行研究。,"For example, if your college or university has 10,000 students, you could randomly select 200 for a study."
8232,你指派给这10000位学生每个人一个数字编号，第一个数字编号是0000，第二位是0001、第三位是0002，直到最后一位(第10000位)的编号是9999。,"You would assign each of the 10,000 students a numeric ID.The first numeric ID would be 0000, the second 0001, the third 0002, up through the last (the 10,000th), who would be 9999."
8233,反思这些教练的命运动员时钟：生物学和时间因素如何影响运动表现，体育记者埃里克• 布雷迪（Brady，2 0 1 0 ) 叹息道，“很久以前，教练们都是受人尊重的，他们被视为社群的支柱。他们最佳的体育形象就是被视为永不退缩的船长一一透着坚毅的眼神，虽然严厉 但却公平。你可以信任你的孩子们跟他们在一起”（第1 段）。,"Reflecting on the fates of these coaches, sportswriter Erik Brady (2010) lamented, ""Once upon a time, coaches were respected and revered as pillars of their communities. The best of them sported images as never-flinching captains of their ships—flinty-eyed eminences who were tough but fair. You could trust your kids with them"" (para. 1)."
8233,布雷迪的感悟被体育媒体广'泛共享，很多媒体都惊讶地发现身为美德和领袖名流典范的教练们显然滥用了权威职.,"Brady's sentiments were shared widely across the sports media, many of which were surprised to see that their celebrated paragons of virtue and leadership were evidently abusing their authority as coaches."
8233,权。然而，正如我在本章中所探讨的，曼吉诺、里奇和莱维特并不应被视为异象；相反，他们是已经建立起来的大学橄榄球文化的逻辑产物，他们将继续制定出白人男性气概领导权的神话标准。,"As I argue in this chapter, however, Mangino, Leach, and Leavitt should not be viewed as unusual; rather, they are the logical products of a college football culture that has been built upon, and continues to valorize, a mythology of white masculine leadership."
8234,外表可能具有欺骗性。,And appearances can be deceiving.
8234,轻度脑外伤的表象可能会对长期失忆产生重大影响。,What might seem to be minor head trauma can actually play a major role in long-term memory loss.
8234,尽管我们所说的脑外伤通常是指110万患脑震荡等严重损伤的人所遇到的健康问题，但是，头部受伤导致眼冒金星这种轻度问题也可能会在之后引发失忆。,"Though we usually associate brain trauma with the 1.1 million people who suffer concussions or worse, even seeing stars after a minor head injury can lead to later memory loss."
8235,使用组内相关R来表示信度系数而不探用相关系数r的原因，以及如何计算组内相关R的方式都有说明。,The rationale for using intraclass R instead of r for reliability and the computational procedures for intraclass R were presented.
8235,描述了估计信度的各种方式，例如稳定性、复本、以及内部一致性。,"Various methods of estimating reliability were mentioned, such as stability, alternate forms, and internal consistency."
8235,了解测量标准误的概念是重要的。,An understanding of the concept of standard error of measurement is vital.
8235,任何测验分数应该仅被视为一个人真实分数可能落入的分数区间的估计值。,Any test score should be viewed as only an estimate of a person’s true score that probably falls within a range of scores.
8236,骨的生长是在内分泌系统的控制下按照遗传程序发生的整个骨架变大的过程。,Growth is the expression of the genetically programmed process of enlargement of the entire skeleton under the control of the endocrine system.
8236,生长时，不会发生有选择性的某些骨骼的增大或某个骨骼特殊区域的增粗。,There is no selective enlargement of individual bones or specific regions within a single bone.
8236,骨骼生长会涉及到整个的骨架。随着长骨骨骺的愈合，纵向的生长就终止了。,Growth involves the entire skeleton and longitudinal growth ceases with the closure of the epiphyses of the long bones.
8237,内在效度与外在效度，和研究设计与所采用的研究控制有所关联。,Internal validity and external validity relate to the research design and controls that are used.
8237,内在效度指的是结果能归因于研究处理的程度。,Internal validity refers to the extent to which the results can be attributed to the treatments used in the study.
8237,换句话说，研究者必须尽其所能去控制会影响结果的所有其他变数。,"In other words, the researcher must try to control all other variables that could influence the results."
8238,成瘾是最严重的脑部失调问题之一，与脑内化学物质机能失常有关。,One of the more serious brain-related disorders that’s attributed to chemical malfunctions in the brain is addiction.
8238,某些物质能在人脑内释放或增加某类化学物质，引发我们上瘾的感觉。,We become addicted to substances that in­crease or release certain chemicals in our brain.
8238,特定的一些物质，如尼古丁，会释放多巴胺，那是一种引起愉悦感的化学物质，让人体想要更多的尼古了。由此引发的习惯性行为会让多巴胺源源不断地注入人体系统中。,"Certain substances like nicotine re­lease dopamine, the pleasure chemical, and your body craves more of it—which leads to a habitual behavior to keep pumping dopamine into your system."
8239,人体感知到有异己物质进入，就将免疫细胞派往该区域。,"In response to the foreign matter, your body sends immune cells to the area."
8239,免疫细胞接触到花粉，就像手榴弹一样爆炸了，发出信号叫来更多的白血球细胞逬行侦察。,"When they attach to the pollen, they explode like a grenade and call in more white blood cells to investigate."
8239,白血球细胞大批向该区域移动，导致局部发炎，将黏液转移到肺内，化学物质转移到发炎区域，包括靠近肌肉的部位。,"That migration of white blood cells to the area causes the area to inflame and move mucus into the lung and chemicals into the immediate area, including near the muscles."
8240,如果你经常乘飞机，就应该每隔两小时起身四处走动一下，或坐在座位上活动腿部。,"If you fly a lot, you should gef up and walk around every two hours, or move your feet with exercises at your seat."
8240,这样能够避免产生深静脉血栓（或腿部静脉阻塞）。,Doing so will help you prevent a condition called deep vein thrombosis (or clotted leg vein) that occurs when you're sitting in the same position for a long time.
8240,在固定位置上久坐会出现这种健康问题：腿部不活动，凝血累积就会形成。,"The danger is that without movement, a blood clot can form in the leg."
8240,这种凝块还有时能进入肺部，阻住血液输往肺部（那就糟糕了）。,That clot can then slip up into the lungs ond block off their blood supply (that's a bad thing).
8241,我们可以说，这一事件发生在联盟成立的第12个年头，WNBA大体上是通过促进联盟成为女权和好女孩的堡垒来反驳黑人女性不守纪律和道德上有缺陷的挥之不去的刻板印象。,"Suffice it to say that at the time of this incident in the league's 12th year of existence, the WNBA had generally countered lingering stereotypes of Black women as undisciplined and morally deficient by promoting the league as a bastion of both girl power and good girls."
8241,也就是说，WNBA联盟中充斥着才华横溢、大概道德高尚以及和蔼可亲的运动员，她们都是因为对篮球的热爱才在场上拼搏，她们都可以作为正确的角色模板。例如参与诸如“WNBA关怀”(WNBA CARES) 一类的活动来加人社区服务。,"That is, the WNBA appeared to be stocked with talented, presumably morally superior, and gracious athletes who all played for the love of the game and served as appropriate role models, for example, by engaging in community service via such vehicles as WNBA CARES."
8242,呕吐本身能够成为愉快和成瘾的行为。,Vomiting itself can become a pleasurable and addictive behaviour.
8242,易饿症患者把他们的呕吐称为“一种快感”或“一种真正的快感”。,Bulimics have referred to their vomiting episodes as 'a rush' or 'a real high'.
8242,呕吐可以每天发生20次或更多，但是易饿症患者的牙釉质不一定会受到呕吐物的破坏而经常去看牙医。,"Vomiting can occur as frequently as 20 or more episodes a day, and it is not unusual for bulimics to have excessive disruption of tooth enamel from the acid in the vomitus, requiring extensive dental repair."
8242,易饿症很少会致死，但是，排泄行为会引起电解质的紊乱，特别是低钾血症，从而导致致命的心率紊乱。,"Bulimia seldom results in death, however, severe electrolyte disturbances from purging behaviours, particularly hypokalaemia, can lead to lethal cardiac arrythmias."
8243,即使努力尝试保证公平竞争，在青少年运动参与者中，体型、力量与技术的不匹配也在所难免。,"Size, strength and skill mismatches are rather common in many youth sports in spite of efforts to equate participants for competition."
8243,此种对抗不匹配所造成的不公平竞争，以及由此导致的损伤发生率升高，在接触性或冲撞性运动中表现得非常突出。,The potential competitive inequity and increased risk of injury associated with such mismatches are especially evident in contact and collision sports.
8243,"许多学者建议：青少年在体型与生物学成熟度上与对抗匹配能有效减少由于体型、(Gallagher, 1969; Seefeldt, 1981; Caine & 力量与技术上不匹配所造成的影响Broekhoff， 1987)。","Matching participants by body size and biological maturity status is often indicated as an important means of reducing size, strength and skill mismatches in youth sports (e.g.Gallagher, 1969; Seefeldt, 1981; Caine & Broekhoff, 1987)."
8244,当紧张达到极大值肘，对身体就很危险了。,"When those stressors reach extremely high levels, stress becomes dangerous."
8244,这是由于紧张激素皮质醇在此发挥作用。,That‘s because of the effect of the stress hormone called cortisol.
8244,当机体处于不断的紧张之中时，皮质醇的含量就会升至极高水平。,"When you've constantly under stress, your cortisol is elevated too high."
8244,当分泌激素的腺体枯竭时，皮质醇的含量就会变低。,"When your glands become exhausted, you end up with low levels."
8244,此时，紧张会对人体造成最大伤害——它耗尽了人体分泌皮质酵的能力。,That's when stress is most damaging—when it exhausts your ability to increase your cortisol.
8245,研究族群(study population )应能适切回答研究问题。,The study population should be appropriate to answer the research questions asked in the study.
8245,作者应该描述研究的样本大小，说明招募了多少参与者进入此研究，多少人完成了研究所要求的工作，以及多少人被纳入资料分析中。,"Writers should describe their sample size to include how many subjects were enrolled in the study, completed the tasks as assigned, and were included in the data analysis."
8245,作者也应该对从研究开始到结束的过程中有关样本大小改变的原因，提出解释。,The writers also should provide an explanation of differences in the sample sizes from the start to the end of the study.
8245,这是避免产生偏误研究的一个重要议题。,This is an important issue for avoiding biased studies.
8245,招募样本的方法以及收录标准与排除标准，均应在此段落中予以说明。,The methods used to recruit the subjects and inclusion or exclusion criteria should be listed.
8246,为了把自己推起来，必须稳住篮球。如果不能以静力控制篮球，篮球就会向外滚动，这需要有力量极大的手臂与肩部，还有冠军级的肩袖。,"In order to press yourself up, the basketball must be stabilized—it will tend to shoot outwards if not isometrically controlled.This will require huge arm and shoulder power, as well as Olympian rotator cuff muscles."
8246,征服偏重倒立撑，你就会拥有超级强悍的关节和山地大猩猩般的肩膀。,The master of the uneven handstand pushup will earn shoulders like a gorilla and super-tough joints.
8247,偏重俯卧撑是第一个高级俯卧撑动作，它能够帮助健身者适应由双手俯卧撑向单臂俯卧撑的过渡。,The uneven pushup is the first of the advanced pushup exercises that will take the athlete from double arm pushups to the single arm variety.
8247,你也可以选用一个固定的物体（如砖块），而不用篮球，不过篮球是最好的选择。,"You can use stable objects—like bricks or a cinderblock—instead of a basketball, but the basketball is best."
8247,控制篮球的同时可以锻炼你的肩袖，这有助于你完成难度更高的动作。,"The act of stabilizing the ball brings the seldom-used rotator cuff muscles into play, strengthening them for the more intense exercises to come."
8248,偏重深蹲是到挑战单腿深蹲的第一步。,Uneven squats are the first big step towards mastering unilateral squats.
8248,到现在为止，深蹲系列中各式的动作都是对称的——都能够均衡地锻炼双腿。,"Up until now, the effect of the steps in the squat series has been symmetrical; they have developed both legs equally."
8248,练习该动作时，放在篮球上的那条腿位置相对较高，而且又必须控制篮球，所以无法完全发力。,"In this exercise, the leg on the ball cannot supply much power due to its raised position and the fact that it has to control the ball."
8248,踩在地上的那条腿需要承担大部分工作，要有足够的力量在另一条腿的辅助下把身体从最低点推起。,"The non-ball leg does most of the work, and acquires superior strength while still having enough help to push the athlete out of the difficult bottom position."
8248,这个动作还可以很好地改善你的平衡能力与协调能力。,The balance and coordination are also greatly improved as a result of this exercise.
8249,偏重引体向上的历史可以追溯到几百年前，但此动作再度流行则是因为电影《洛奇2》——史泰龙用该动作进行训练。,"Uneven pullups go back centuries, but they were made instantly popular again when Sylvester Stallone performed them during the famous training montage of Rocky II."
8249,由于手臂的位置不同，抓握横杆的那只手臂不得不承担大部分的工作，这将为做单臂引体向上打下基础。,"Due to the altered arm position, the arm gripping the bar has to do the majority of the work, preparing the athlete for the true unilateral pullup movements which follow in the series."
8249,该动作能够增强背阔肌、肱二头肌以及背部肌肉的力量，同时也会极大地锻炼抓握能力。,"The lats, biceps and back gain in strength as a result.The grip in particular gets a great workout."
8250,掌握坐姿屈膝之后，接着练习平卧抬膝可以进一步强化训练者的腰部。,"This exercise continues where  knee tucks leaves off, further strengthening the waist."
8250,平卧抬膝训练脊椎肌肉、腹部肌肉、腹斜肌和腹横肌，使之协调工作，同时也能够锻炼大腿前侧肌肉。,"Flat knee raises train the spinal muscles, abdominal muscles, obliques and transversus to function in a coordinated way.The muscles of the frontal thigh are also toned."
8250,由于该动作要求训练者平躺在地上，所以髋部屈肌也必须更多地参与其中，这会使训练者适应之后强度更大的平卧动作和悬垂动作。,"The position on the floor requires increased hip flexor involvement, which will condition the athlete for the more intense floor and hanging exercises which come later in the leg raise series."
8251,评价量表有很多不同型态。,There are different kinds of rating scales.
8251,有些使用数字评分，有些使用检核表，有些使用语文线索结合数字评分，也有使用强迫选项，或是使用排序的方式。,"Some use numerical ratings, some use checklists, some have verbal cues associated with numerical ratings, some require forced choices, and still others use rankings."
8251,有些量表很简易，但有些则很复杂。,"Some scales are simple, whereas others are complex."
8252,儿童总吸氧量比较高的原因可能有几个。,There are several possible mechanisms for the higher total O2 costs in children.
8252,"底物利用本身就可以改变VO2的与工作速率之间的关系。因为脂肪P:0比率 (高能磷酸盐与O2的比率）是2.82,葡萄糖是3(McGilvery，1983)。","Substrate utilization itself can modify the relationship between VO2 and work rate because the P : O (high-energy phosphate to O2) ratio is 2.82 for fats and 3 for glucose (McGilvery, 1983)."
8252,如果运动时儿童代谢的主要是脂肪，而成年人仅仅是葡萄糖，则吸氧量的差异不应超过6%。,"If children metabolized solely fat and adults only glucose (which is highly unlikely), then the difference in O2 cost could be no more than 6%."
8252,"但研究发现，儿童吸氧量几乎平均比成年人高40%,因此，儿童与成年人吸氧量的差异与儿童和成年人底物代谢水平差异不一致。","But the difference we observed was, on average, almost 40% greater in children, and, therefore, inconsistent with a growth-related difference in substrate utilization."
8253,七鳃鳗通过肌肉活动产生波动，从头到尾依次收缩来游动。,"The lamprey swims by producing waves of muscle activity, contracting sequentially from head to tail."
8253,脊髓的神经细胞引起每个节段肌肉的收缩。,Contraction of each of the segmental  muscles is triggered by nerve cells located in the spinal cord.
8253,虽然每一段都与下一段完全地协调，但必须有个时间差以创造波动。,"While  each segment has to be coordinated with the next one down the line,  there must be a time lag to create a wave."
8254,因此，图像在视网膜的运动速率似乎对于速度估计没有多大作用。,"So, rate of image movement in the retina of the eye would not seem to be helpful in estimating velocity."
8254,反而，为获得恰当的时机掌控而估算飞过来的物体 的速度时，很可能是通过计算物体大小的变化来实现。,"Instead, estimating the speed of the incoming object to permit coincidental timing is probably achieved by figuring out relative changes in the size of the object as it nears."
8254,也就是说，当投出的球接近于击球手时，球在他的视野内变得更大。,"That is, as the pitched ball approaches the batter, it gets larger in his field of vision."
8254,球来的越快，它变大的速度也越快。,
8255,相对而言，青少年运动员很少发生骨盆与髋部的应力性骨折。,Stress fractures about the pelvis and hip in young athletes are relatively unusual.
8255,在跑步或跳跃项目的年轻女子运动员中较多见。,These have been much more commonly reported in young female runners or athletes involved in jumping sports.
8255,有报道认为，年轻运动员发生髂嵴应力性损伤是因反复训练所致。,Iliac crest stress injuries have been reported in young athletes as a result of repetitive training.
8255,图13.3显示，对此年龄段而言，骨盆应力会导致明显的骨突撕脱 (Micheli，1990)。,"Much more commonly in this age group, stresses about the pelvis will result in frank apophyseal avulsions (Micheli, 1990) (Fig. 13.3)."
8256,其中之一就是体操垫的柔软性，若垫子太软则会因为腕关节过度背伸而容易损伤。,One such factor is the compliance of the landing mats.Mats that are too soft or compliant can contribute to injuries due to excessive dorsiflexion of the wrist.
8256,另一个因素是跳跃转体时腕关节过伸和尺偏。,Another contributing factor is the hyperextension and ulnar deviation of the wrist which result from twisting motions as observed during vaulting activities.
8256,当进行支撑和翻转动作时，手部固定，而前臂反复承受扭转应力易导致骨的最薄弱部位骨骺的损伤。,"In beam and tumbling workouts, the hands are fixed as the forearms undergo repetitive torsional stress possibly predisposing the epiphysis, the weakest part of the bone, to excessive stress."
8257,最后，前列腺肥大的患者会整夜频繁起床，排尿困难。,"People with BPH end up getting up frequently throughout the night to urinate, and they have difficulty initiating a stream of urine."
8257,病情如果进一步恶化，排尿会变得更加痛苦，患者永远没办法排净膀胱里的尿。（尿液还可能回流至肾脏，慢慢地损害肾脏功能，因此患者必须坚持起床，站着排尿。）,"As the disease progresses, the difficulty worsens—and you can never get all of the urine out of your bladder (The fear is that the urine can get backed up in the kidneys and slowly kill them over time—to keep getting up to urinate.)"
8258,热身之后，在技巧训练中选择3个技巧训练项目，每个技巧训练项目间跑步20米。,"After warming up, perform three drills from the drill section, with 20 meters of running between each drill repeat."
8258,（例如，以前倾跳跃开始，然后跑步20米，再做提腿练习，然后跑步20米，最后以交替提腿练习结束。,"(For example, start with hop with forward lean, run 20 meters, do the pulling wall drill, run another 20 meters, and finish with the alternating foot drill.)"
8258,）接下来，进行以节奏为重点的30秒跑步训练。,"Next, perform four 30-second runs with an emphasis on cadence."
8258,用一个便携的节拍器，设定节奏为每分钟94下，记录每一次左脚踏中节奏的次数。,"Using a portable metronome set at 94 beeps per minute, time each pull of your left foot with the beep."
8258,每次跑步练习后休息1分钟。,Rest 1 minute after each run.
8258,之后再次重复整组练习。,Then do the whole set a second time.
8258,接下来，用稍慢的节奏跑一组更长的距离。,"Next, run a longer distance at a slightly slower cadence."
8258,节拍器设定每分钟91下，跑步时间为2 分钟，让左脚跟上这个节奏。,"Set the metronome for 91 beeps per minute and run for 2 minutes, pulling your left foot in sync with the beat."
8258,休息2分钟，然后重复4次30秒跑步和2分钟跑步。做2组。,Rest 2 minutes; then repeat the four 30-second runs and the 2-minute run.
8258,最后进行赤足力量练习。,"Finally, it’s time for barefoot strength work."
8258,在沙地或草地上以舒适的配速跑50米，注意保证正确的动作和快速的节奏。之后步行回到起跑线。,Run 50 meters in sand or grass at a comfortable pace while focusing on maintaining good mechanics and a fast cadence.Walk back to the starting line after each repetition.
8258,重复这项练习10次。,Perform this routine 10 times.
8259,体育运动员受伤，大多会成为媒体报道的头条新闻。女性运动员前十字韧带撕裂的几率是男性运动员的8倍。,"Athletes get all the headlines when they get injured, but women are up to eight times more likely than men to tear their ACL."
8259,女性膝部的生理结构较男性松散，女性的骨骼也从整体上比男性脆弱，这就对稳定性造成了负面影响，致使女性的韧带更易于撕裂。,The looser construction of the female knee—and overall weaker skeleton—can compromise stability ond predispose women to ligament tears.
8260,我们可以把丘脑（见图3.1)想象成大城市里的火车站，它是总站，从这里出 发，可以到达许多小城镇。人脸的许多不 同部位都经过丘脑。,Think of the thalamus（pictured in Figure 3.1）as a train station in a major city that acts as a hub for many other smaller locations.
8260,丘脑从脊柱获取感 觉信息，然后在人体还没开始运动前，就 对要做的动作进行微凋，让人活动更自 如（丘脑出现问题，会引起四肢颤抖或运 动不自然）。,"That's because many different parts of the brain run through it; the thalamus takes sensory information from the spine and then fine-tunes what movements you make before they even start.It s really responsible for making actions smooth (problems with the thalamus can result in tremors, or nonsmooth motor movements)."
8261,尽管一些业余联赛中强制规定使用无拇指拳击手套，但此举并不足以保护眼睛。,"While thumbless boxing gloves have been mandated in some amateur leagues, this regulation is inadequate for eye protection."
8261,高危险性项目及推荐使用的保护措施详见表15.1。,Examples of high risk sports and recommendations for protective eyewear are shown in Table 15.
8261,美国儿科协会和美国眼科协会正着手制定更明 确的体育项目分类方法以及使用保护性眼罩的建议。,1. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Ophthalmology Association are developing a more definitive sports classification schema and recommendations for use of protective eyewear.
8262,"图37.4是多元纵向设计的一个例子， 采用的是3个出生组别（1980，1981和1982）,在连续4年期间（1993 — 1996) 测试。","In Fig. 37.4 an example is given of a multiple longitudinal design using three birth cohorts (1980, 1981 and 1982) that will be measured during four consecutive years (1993—1996)."
8262,由于存在年龄的重叠，各组别可以在不同年龄进行相互比较（图37.4的横向比较）。,"Because there is an overlap in age, the cohorts can be compared with each other at different ages (horizontal comparisons in Fig. 37.4)."
8262,在该年龄的组间的系统差异称为“群体效应” （cohort effect)。,A systematic difference between the cohorts at these ages is called a 'cohort effect'.
8262,同时， 在纵向研究中，可以将其他混合因素（即测试时间因素）区别开来（Veling& Van't Hof，1980)。,"At the same time, it is possible to distinguish another confounding factor in a longitudinal study, namely the factor of time of measurement (Veling & Van 't Hof, 1980)."
8263,计时赛本身也是一项很好的训练。,A TT is also effective training on its own.
8263,把每次计时赛训练当作一次正式比赛——准备热身，进行动作训练，开始轻松慢跑，然后进行冲剌跑，在整个过程中保证身体处于活跃状态。,"Treat one as you would a race—take time to warm up, starting with drills and working your way up to striders and sprints to ensure that your engine is hot."
8263,训练结束后进行等量的冷身，认真进行放松慢跑和拉伸。,"Cool down with the same level of focus, giving attention to slow running and stretching."
8263,最后的放松阶段有助于防止受伤，并帮助循环和淋巴系统及时排出废物。,This helps prevent injury and gives your circulatory and lymphatic systems time to clear out waste products.
8264,在下个段落里，当你针对一个困难的规范性问题进行反思时，你将需要决定你在认识论上的立场。,"When you begin your reflections on a difficult normative problem in the next section, you will have to decide where you stand on this matter of epistemology."
8264,图13.2在一个连续体上标示了三个约略的位置：信心从最少到最大。,Figure 13.2 shows three broad positions along a continuum: from minimal to maximal confidence.
8264,我们从那些对哲学推论的力量抱持最少信念的人为开端，也就是相信客观是不可得的与寻找真理不是哲学的目的的那些人。,"We begin with those who place minimal faith in the power of philosophical reasoning, those who believe that objectivity is not available and that truth finding is not philosophy's purpose."
8265,媒体不断地把某些行为、能力以及习性与某些群体联系在一起，由此形成了认知框架。,"Cognitive frames can be shaped by media reports that repeatedly link certain behaviors, abilities, and propensities with certain groups."
8265,"举个例子来说，体育社会学的研究表明，黑人男性运动员往往被描述为，或由传媒塑造”为性欲过剩以及具有暴力潜质的个体 (Davis & Harris, 1998, pp. 157-165)。拉丁裔男性运动员往往被认为是脾气火爆、意气用事和不可预知的(Hoose, 1989) 。","Research in the sociology of sports, for example, has found that Black male athletes tend to be characterized, or ""mediated,"" as oversexed and potentiallyviolent individuals (see Davis & Harris, 1998, pp. 157-165), with Latino athletes considered hot- tempered and, by extension, emotional and unpredictable (Hoose, 1989)."
8266,如果你能达到悬垂屈举腿的升级标准，那做5次悬垂蛙举腿应该不在话下。,"If you can meet the progression standard for  hanging bent leg raises, five reps of hanging frog raises should be well within your capabilities."
8266,训练者难以从悬垂屈举腿升级到悬垂蛙举腿，通常是因为身体柔韧性较差，而非力量不足。,"When students have difficulty moving from bent leg raises to frog-type movements, the issue is usually lack of flexibility rather than strength."
8266,其实这很容易解决：练习之前先做几分钟体前屈动作，拉伸下背部和腘绳肌。,This can be easily cured by bending forwards and stretching out the lower back and hamstrings for a few minutes before attempting this exercise.
8267,乳酸阈是以 Úo2max 函数的百分率来表示，这个百分率因人而异，即使在参加耐力训练的运动员中也是如此。,"Often lactate threshold is expressed as the percentage of the V o2 max at which it is observed, and this percentage varies m arkedly across individuals, even among endurance-trained athletes."
8267,运动员参加长时间运动项目比赛，一般都是在乳酸阈的强度下进行的。,Athletes typically perform long duration sport events at intensities approximating the lactatethreshold.
8267,所以，维持高速率消耗有氧代谢能量的能力可以通过增强 Úo2max 函数或乳酸阈或同时增强二者来取得。,"Therefore, ability to sustain a high rate of aerobic energy expenditure can be enhanced by increasing either or both of V o2 max and lactate threshold."
8268,近年来，相对选择性β2-激动剂(β2-agonists)的发展，具有使支气管平滑肌松弛的作用，而对心脏的作用较小。,"Recent years have seen the development of relatively selective β2-agonists, that have potent bronchial smooth muscle relaxant effect, with little cardiac stimulation."
8268,"这些药物，包括（美国）阿布特罗或（世界其他地方）沙丁胺醇,奥西那林，特布他林，比托特罗,非诺特罗和沙米特罗是治疗哮喘中支气管痉挛的主要药物。不论是对慢性的或急性的支气管痉挛，也包括运动性哮喘有效。","These agents, including albuterol (USA) or salbutamol (rest of the world), metaproterenol, terbutaline, bitolterol, fenoterol and salmeterol, are the mainstay in the treatment of the bronchospastic component of asthma, be it chronic or acute, including EIA."
8269,如果你曾经从滑板上摔下来，或者撕掉过倒刺皮，你就肯定了解自然界的急救措施。,"If you've ever crashed a skateboard or peeled a hangnail, you're sure to know about nature's Band-Aids."
8269,措施的一种就是伤痂，伤痂会很快覆盖伤口。,"One is the scab, which covers the wound almost immediately."
8269,如果帮助凝血的蛋白从血液中出来保护伤口，就会形成伤痂，这实际也是加速痊愈的过程。,A scab is formed when proteins that help coagulate blood come out of the bloodstream to protect the wound—and actually accelerate the healing process.
8270,文化名流的概念开始与我们相伴是从1 2世纪欧洲作家和画家的第一幅肖像开始的。肖像后来被销售给他们潜在的赞助商— 这就是前资本主义社会中作者的商品化。,"The idea of cultural celebrity has been with us since the first portraits of writers and painters in 12th century Europe, which marketed their subjects to potential sponsors—a precapitalist commodification of authorship."
8270,到了 17世纪，肖像成为教学方法。,"In the 17t h century, portraits became methods of instruction."
8271,一旦你的手臂已经完全伸直，就落下来并重复以上动作。,Drop back down and repeat the exercise once your arms are straight.
8271,刚开始练习的时候，你主要是靠跳起来的惯性完成动作转换，但随着你不断变强，对跳跃的依赖就会越来越少。,"In the early days, you’ll find yourself jumping hard to achieve the transition, but you’ll do this less and less as you get stronger."
8271,我是在圣昆汀学到这个动作的，那儿的囚徒们将其称之为“哨兵引体向上”，但我在其他地方从没听过这样的称呼。,"In San Quentin, where I first learned this technique, the convicts called them “sentry pullups,” although I’ve never heard the name anywhere else."
8271,我不知道为什么叫这个名字，但我想可能是因为该动作就像一个家伙爬上高处，窥探远方一样。,"I don’t know for sure, but if I had to guess, I’d say that they were called this because it looks like the guy doing them is pulling himself up on something, to spy out into the distance."
8271,如果我没有猜对，并且有人知道其真正原因的话，烦请相告。,"If I’m wrong and someone else knows the real source of the name, please write in and tell me."
8272,资料分析必须要说明个人层次与社区层次在行为上的变化。,Data analysis must account for community-level and individual-level variations in behaviors.
8272,社区介入的优点在允许研究者看著群体因介入方案而有所改变。,An advantage of community trials is that they allow researchers to see the population changes in behaviors as a result of interventions.
8272,但这项优点也许会被难以改变个人行为，以及需花费更多时间(有时需要很多年)才能看到社区行为的改变等情况而抵销。,But this benefit is tempered by the difficulty of changing individual behaviors and the amount of time that may be required (sometimes many years) to see changes in community behaviors.
8273,这些能量因素之间的关系是互相协调的。,There is a synergistic relationship between these energy factors.
8273,"在保存骨质方面，缺乏负重性活动时补充钙剂是无效的（Kanis，1991),而一生中足够的钙的摄入量有助于运动增强骨骼的作用（Kanders et al.，1988; Halioua & Anderson, 1989)。","Calcium supplementation in the absence of weight-bearing is ineffective in terms of bone maintenance (Kanis, 1991) while adequate lifetime calcium intake augments the bone-building effects of exercise (Kanders et al., 1988; Halioua & Anderson, 1989)."
8273,香戈尔德等（Shangold et al.，1990)证明，如果膳食中钙的摄入量不足，运动对骨骼的作用是无法实现的。,Shangold et al. (1990) have stated that the beneficial effects of exercise on bone cannot be realized if dietary calcium is inadequate.
8274,Alexander Leaf博士这样描述他的观察：“像祷告文一样枯燥乏味的生活方式。,Dr. Leaf describes his observations as “a monotonous litany of similar lifestyles.”
8274,”他在三个地点目睹了以下状况：•贫穷的农耕文化和每日繁重的体力劳动是常态。•每日剧烈的身体活动开始于童年时代，然后持续一生。•素食。•对上了年纪的人的帮助和尊重。,"He witnessed the following in all three locations: Poor, agrarian culture in which daily hard labor was the norm ⦁Vigorous daily physical activity beginning in childhood and persisting throughout life ⦁A vegetarian diet ⦁Strong support for the elderly"
8275,"很多新的证据说明，身体脂肪含量及其分布，特别是在腹部的分布与雌性激素水平增高和雄性激素水平降低有关：血浆雌激素比值（de Ridder et al., 1990)。","Considerable recent evidence suggests that body fat content and its regional distribution, especially to the abdominal area, are related to increased oestrogen levels and lower androgen: oestrogen ratios in plasma (de Ridder et al., 1990)."
8275,提早成熟女孩的腹部有脂肪堆积 (Frisancho & Flegel，1982)。,"The earlier maturing girl has an abdominal accumulation of fat (Frisancho & Flegel, 1982)."
8275,青春期发育 速度是否与身体成分和脂肪分布的方式有 关的问题尚未得到充分的研究。,Whether the tempo of puberty contributes to body composition and fat patterning has not been adequately studied.
8276,神话有助于文化的发展，帮助人们理解他们身处的世界。,Myths contribute to the development of culture and help humans make sense of their world.
8276,运动员个人所取得的成就可以被视为当代美国神话的基础。,The individual achievements of athletes can operate as the foundation for American contemporary myths.
8276,体育神话能让运动员通过竞争、男性化以及种族认同来展现更大范围的文化神话。,"Sports myths allow athletes to embody the larger cultural myths of competition, masculinity, and racial identity."
8276,这些文化不同于传统的、基于文献的神话，只作用为社会日常生活的一部分。,"Unlike traditional, literature-based myths, these myths function uniquely as part of everyday society."
8277,我们处理外界信息，一般是将信息从感觉器官直接送至脑皮层，我们可以在这里处理感知到的信息。,"We usually process outside information by passing it directly from the sensory organ to the cortex, where we process what we have learned."
8277,人眼将图像信息送至丘脑，人耳将声音和平衡信息送至顶骨叶。,The eyes send images to the occipital lobe; and the ears send sound and balance information to the parietal lobe.
8277,但是，嗅觉的情况比较特殊。,But smell is unique.
8277,气味通过位于鼻梁顶端的檇状软骨，刺激嗅球神经。,An odor passes through the cribiform plate at the top of the nose and stimulates the olfactory nerve.
8277,这种神经绕过能过滤信息的脑皮质，将信息送至人脑最初始的部分（杏仁核），在这里，情感反应几乎都是由潜意识产生的。,"This nerve bypasses the cortex, which filters information, and sends the information to the most ancient part of our brain (amygdala), where emotional responses occur almost subconsciously."
8278,也有一些其他的暗示，如核心体温的昼夜节律可能是驱动其他相同表现的生物节律的力量，因为体温对他们中的大多数有直接影响。,"Some have suggested, too, that circadian rhythms of core temperature may be the driving force behind other physiological rhythms that peak at the same time of day, since body temperature has a direct influence on a number of these."
8278,此外，在多数的例子中，这种联系似乎可以提髙运动表现。,"Moreover, in a number of cases, such a link might be expected to improve motor performance."
8278,例如神经传导速度，当体温每升高1℃，神经传导速度可提髙2.4m/s。酶的催化活动在新陈代谢过程中是随着体温的升髙而加速的。,"Velocity of nerve conduction, for example, increases by 2.4 meters per second for each rise in body temperature of 1 degree C. Enzymatic activity in metabolic processes is accelerated as temperature increases."
8278,体温的高低会明显影响肌肉和肌腱的柔韧性和收缩性。,Elevations in body temperature may positively influence flexibility and contractile function of muscles and tendons.
8279,神经性厌食症特征如下：1.拒绝保持按年龄和身高计算的最低体重标准。,Anorexia nervosa is a disorder characterized by: 1 A refusal to maintain body weight over a minimal level considered normal for age and height.
8279,2.身体形象变形。,2 A distorted body image.
8279,3.虽然体重不足，但是仍然强烈惧怕肥胖和增加体重。,"3 An intense fear of fatness or gaining weight while, in fact, remaining underweight."
8279,4.闭经。,4 Amenorrhoea.
8280,（好了，如果你喝无糖汽水，那么就至少不会吸收到无用的热量了，不过茌本书里我们说的饮水，还是指喝普通水。低糖饮料的甜味可能导致摄入糖分的其他行为——那些饮用低糖饮料的人比饮用黑咖啡、茶和水的人更容易得糖尿病。,"(Okay, if you like diet sodas, at least you won't consume the empty calories in the cola but we mean water here. And maybe the sweet taste of diet drinks encourages other sweet consumption—those who consume “diet drinks” are more likely to develop diabetes than those who consume black coffee, tea, or water)"
8280,）另外，由于引发肾结石的主要原因是失水，所以每天身体需要补充2000毫升的水。,"Also, since the main cause of kidney stones is dehydration, it's essential to keep your body hydrated with sixty-four ounces (eight glasses of eight ounces) of water a day."
8281,当脑垂体腺分泌过量时，肾上腺也会反映出分泌过量的皮质醇。,"When excess pituitary secretion happens, the adrenal glands respond by secreting excess cortisol."
8281,（这个过程就像一个激素的多米诺骨牌游戏，一种分泌诱发一连串的反应。,(The process is like a game of hormonal dominoes; one secretion triggers a chain of others.)
8281,）皮质醇控制着身体处理碳水化合物、脂肪、蛋白质的过程，还帮助身体减少发炎症状。,"Cortisol also controls the way the body processes carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, and helps the body reduce inflammation."
8282,当然，肾脏一天的工作就是把含水的代谢废物从身体中漓除出去，但是它们更是主要的分泌激素的器官。,"Sure, the kidneys' day job is removing water waste from your body, but they double as key hormone-producing organs as well."
8282,你的肾脏能分泌一种激素，这种激素通过防止红色血细胞过早死亡，从而刺激它们的生成。,Your kidneys are responsible for producing a hormone that stimulates the production of red blood cells by preventing their premature death.
8282,这种激素还能帮助保存其他细胞，像由于缺乏血液流动而受到伤害的心脏和脑细胞。,This hormone also helps preserve other cells like heart and brain cells that have been injured by lack of blood flow.
8283,人休肠道与下列哪种器官相似？,Your intestines are most similar to what other organ?
8283,A.心脏，因为两者都是将营养输送到全身各处。,"a.Your heart, because it pumps nutrients through the body."
8283,B.大脑，因为两者释放相似的化学物质。,"b. Your brain, because it releases the same chemicals."
8283,C.声带，因为人饥饿的时候两者都会叫。,"c. Your vocal cords, because they growl when you're hungry."
8283,D.教堂的大风琴，因为两者都能发出各种奇妙的声音。,"d. The big one at the back of the church, because it makes all kinds of majestic sounds."
8284,你的视力会因为几个原因而改变，比如说，你可能注意到，早上的视力会较差，这也许是因为角膜缺水造成的，而不是因为屈光问题引起的。,"Now, your vision can change for several reasons.For instance, you may notice worse vision in the morning—but that could stem from dehydration of the cornea, not from true refractive problems."
8284,你的眼睛需要有较好的润滑从而准确聚焦。眼球通过泪腺及副泪腺和眨眼保持润滑。,Your eyes need to be well lubricated to focus; they stay lubricated through your three-layer tear supply and by blinking.
8285,这些仅仅是运动员关于时差轶事的一小部分。,
8285,在上述例子中，时差真的是肇事者吗？,"In the preceding  examples, was jet lag really to blame?"
8285,或者仅仅是运动员的一个随意的借口？,Or was it just a handy excuse?
8285,当要跨越多个时区去参加比赛，非本地运动员就会打乱他们有规律的生物节律。,"When traveling across multiple time zones to compete, international  athletes can disturb their regular biological rhythms."
8285,这种生理失调可能会导致他们在世界竞技舞台上灾难性的后果。,This physiological offset might lead to disastrous impairment in their performance on the world athletic stage.
8285,在这方面，他们都会经历一些由时差引起的不太美好的片断：呕吐，昏厥，由时差导致的判断力下降。,"(In this regard, they would share  infamous episodes of vomiting, fainting, and questionable judgment  induced by jet lag that have also embarrassed political leaders during  international voyages.)"
8286,你可以很容易地用关于时间的本质的书填满整个图书馆。,You could easily fill an entire library with what’s been written about the nature of time.
8286,如果谁想要简洁易读的资源，可以阅读英国作家G.J.惠特罗的书《时间是什么》（What is Time），这本书是1972年牛津大学出版社出版的。,"(Those who wish a concise, easily readable source can try the 1972 book What is Time? by the British author G.J. Whitrow from Oxford Press.)"
8286,其中有许多有趣的主题。,Among these discourses are many intriguing themes.
8286,例如，爱因斯坦相对论就反对时间的绝对性，他阐述了时间的推移取决于正在看时钟的人的位置和速度。,"For instance, Einstein’s ideas on relativity spoke against time as an absolute, stating that the passage of time depends on the location and speed of the person looking at the clock."
8287,我们似乎忘记了时间，在不知不觉中度过了周末。,"We were, it seemed, about to spend the weekend unaware of time."
8287,他的想法并不是原创的。,(His idea was not original.)
8287,18世纪哲学家卢梭，他扔掉手表挣脱时间的束缚，比电影《逍遥骑士》（开场中的PeterFonda(彼得•方达）)还早了几个世纪。,"The 18th-century philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, in a gesture of disdain for the constraints of time, is said to have tossed away his watch, predating Peter Fonda in the opening scene of Easy Rider by a couple of centuries."
8288,追纵研究(follow-upstudies)、前瞻性研究 (prospective studies)与纵贯性研究(longitudinal studies) 等名词，均是用于描述世代研究设计 ( cohort study design ) 。,"The terms follow-up studies, prospective studies, and longitudinal studies have all been used to describe the cohort study design."
8288,在 此种研究设计中，先界定出一个大型且未罹病的群体(称为世代)，并将相关的暴露因子加以测量。,"In this design, a large disease-free population is defined and assessment of relevant exposures is obtained."
8288,基线资料(baseline data)主要在依据暴露因子的类别将群体进行分组 (如 :低、中、高 )。,"Baseline data are used to categorize the cohort into levels of exposure (i.e., low, medium, high)."
8288,在基线测量完成后，追踪期间即开始计算。,"After this baseline assessment has been made, the follow-up period begins."
8288,因慢性病如：大肠癌与乳癌等，病例都相当少。所以 ，追踪期间所持续 的时间少至2年，多可长达至20年。,"Because chronic diseases such as colon and breast cancer are relatively rare, the follow-up period can last from as little as 2 years to more than 20 years."
8288,在追踪期间结束时，在此期间死亡且被诊断患有所欲探究疾病的人数，将予以统计制表。,"At the end of the follow-up period, the number of people within the cohort who died during follow-up and were diagnosed with the disease outcome of interest is tabulated."
8289,青光眼会使你眼睛的排水系统堵塞。（就像一个浴缸排水□被头发堵起来的情况。,"GLAUCOMA With glaucoma, the draining system of your eye clogs up (think of a bathtub drain being covered by hair)."
8289,）眼睛内的液体无法排出，就会对视神经造成很大压力，这将会导致失明。,"The fluid can't drain out, which creates a lot of pressure on the optic nerve, which leads to blindness."
8290,大多数人都认为我们的眼球只是用来向外看的。,Most of us assume that our eyes are just for looking out.
8290,但是就像窗户一样，眼睛一样可以用来向内看。,"But just like windows, they can just as easily be used for looking in."
8290,你的眼睛实际上是与大脑相连的。医生可以通过看你的眼睛看到视神经中的代表性脑神经，这也就使眼腈成为通向你大脑的一扇窗户。,Your eyes are actually a link to your brain —doctors can see representative brain cells in the optic nerve when they look into your eyes—making them a window into your brain.
8291,蜘蛛看世界的方式与我们人类相同，但是它们的视觉系统的工作方式却稍有区别。,"Spiders see like we do, but their systems work a little differently."
8291,它们移动视网膜以便聚焦，如果它们想要看得更远些，它们就把视网膜靠得更近些，而它们的晶状体却是固定的。,"They move their retinas to focus; if they want to see father away, they push their retina closer, while the lens stays fixed."
8291,动物之间视力的最主要的区别就在于——捕食者拥有望远镜式的视线，以便聚焦于猎物，而被捕食者则拥有广阔视野，以便更好地找到潜在的捕食者所处的位置。,"One of the key differences in animals is that hunters have binocular vision to focus on prey, while the hunted have peripheral vision to better locate potential predators."
8292,男孩从儿童期早期到大约13岁时，肌肉等长收缩力量随年龄增长呈线性增加，在这期间，出现一个青春期髙峰，即力量增长的加速。,"In boys, isometric strength increases linearly with age from early childhood to approximately the age of 13 years, when there is a clear adolescent spurt, i.e.an acceleration in strength development."
8292,"有些对女孩的研究发现，女孩力量随着年龄增加，一直到15岁，却未发现在青春期有明显的快速增长现象（Jones, 1949；Asumssen，1962；Malina & Bouchard, 1991)。","In girls, strength increases linearly until 15 years in several studies though there is less evidence of a clear adolescent spurt (Jones, 1949; Asmussen, 1962; Malina & Bouchard, 1991)."
8292,然而，在一项大规模横向的对佛兰德CFlemish) 女孩的研究中发现，在12〜14.5岁阶段，她们的手臂肌肉拉力的增长加速了（图1.1）。,"However, in a large cross- sectional population study of Flemish girls an acceleration was observed in arm pull strength between 12 and 14.5 years (Fig. 1.1)."
8293,首先，让我们看看入们的平均寿命吧。在1900年美国人的平均寿命是47岁，而2000年则达到接近80岁。,"For starters, look at the average life expectancy: forty-seven in 1900, and nearly eighty in 2000."
8293,这增加的33岁寿命大部分要归功于公共卫生设施和医药的有效发展。,A lot of credit for these extra thirty-three years goes to public health and organized medicine.
8293,所以数字显示我们活得越来越长了。,So statistics show that we are going to live long.
8294,现在人们普遍认为，从事体力劳动的人，比长期伏案工作的人平均寿命要长。,"It is now well recognized that those who are physically active, on the average, survive longer than those living sedentary lives."
8294,研究数据清楚地显示，习惯性的能量消耗可以延缓继发性衰老，规律的运动减少健康的风险因素（血脂异常、髙血压、肥胖、骨密度下降）。,"The research  data clearly indicate that this is specifically an expression of the favorable effect of habitual energy expenditure on secondary aging.Regular exercise reduces health risk factors (dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity, reduced bone density)."
8294,另外，它还可能在对抗动脉硬化的过程中产生直接积极的影响。,"In addition, it may have direct protective effects against the atherosclerotic vascular process."
8294,那些在整个成人期都保持髙水平运动的运动员，其继发性衰老可能被延缓。,Athletes who maintain high levels of sport activity through their adult years can expect to benefit from limited secondary aging.
8295,许多家伙都害怕深蹲，因为他们认为深蹲将加重膝盖旧伤。,"Many guys are afraid of the squat, because they think it will aggravate old knee injuries."
8295,其实事实恰恰相反。,"In fact, the opposite is usually true."
8295,做全福的深蹲时，增加的血液流动可以移除累积的废物，恢复旧伤组织，缓解疼痛。,"The increased blood flow and range of motion in full squats removes waste build-up and stretches old scar tissue, alleviating pain."
8295,膝盖及其周围的矶肉与肌腱将变得更强、更柔韧，再受伤的可能性也大大减小了。,"The knees and surrounding muscles and tendons become stronger and more flexible, and the likelihood of future injuries is lessened."
8296,美国是一个狂热的国度：摇呼啦圈、穿灯笼裤、养美洲豹当宠物。,"America is a country of crazes: hula hoops, parachute pants, Chia pets."
8296,有的流行来了又走，有的潮流经久不衰。,"They come, they go, some stick around."
8296,有一种 潮流似乎在国内已待了有一段时间了，这就是高蛋白饮食。,One that appears to be around for a while is the high-protein diet craze.
8296,尽管高蛋白饮食像其他饮食结构一样对瘦身有效，但饮食蛋白质含量过高，会加速骨质流失。,"Although as effective for pure weight loss as other diets, the ultra-high-protein diets can accelerate bone loss."
8297,职业摔角从20世纪50年代开始赢得声誉，参赛选手们开始为他们的粉丝扮演英雄或是恶棍的角色。,"Since professional wrestling first gained prominence in the 1950s, its competitors have played the roles of heroes and villains for their fans."
8297,一些摔角选手的职业轨迹包括了在角色上从“坏人”到救赎再到崇拜的转变。,"The trajectories of some wrestler personae have included a journey from ""bad guy"" to redemption and adoration."
8297,其他的故事情节也包括，一个看起来是“好人”的家伙，经常莫名其妙地变得“邪恶”，并且伤害那些偶尔进入他地盘的人。,"Other storylines have told the tale of a seemingly ""good guy"" who, often inexplicably, turns ""evil"" and hurts those who were once in his corner."
8297,而关于摔角手克里斯•贝诺伊特的成名和陨落的真实故事，就像是后一个故事更令人毛骨悚然当然也更悲伤的版本。,"The real-life story of the rise and fall of wrestler, Chris Benoit, plays like a more gruesome, and certainly sadder, version of the latter."
8298,想要保持这个姿势，你的背部和双腿必须像铁板一样坚挺。,"To maintain this position, your back and legs have to be stiff as a board—hence the name “plank.”"
8298,若没有图片，你很难想象该动作是怎样的——下图能够帮助你了解这一点。,"This is an extremely difficult exercise to visualize without a picture, so I’ve included a photo below to help."
8298,水平俯卧撑是块难啃的硬骨头，攻克它的关键就是坚持练习十式，增强身体的力量。,The exercise is a tough one to pull off; the key is persistence along with the development of basic strength through practicing the ten steps.
8299,脂肪在咽喉后部积累，引起打鼾，在人入睡时，周边肌肉放松，还会引发睡眠呼吸暂停综合征。,Fat accumulates in the back of the throat and causes snoring and sleep apnea when the surrounding muscles relax during sleep.
8299,在舌后部的会厌不让食物进人气管（主通风管），避免呛噎。,"At the back of the tongue, the epiglottis protects the trachea (windpipe) from food and prevents choking."
8299,甲状腺就位于脖子上气管前部。有些人的甲状腺清楚可见。,"The thyroid gland, which is nestled just in front of the trachea in your neckr can be seen in some folks."
8300,这个松果体能够同你的眼睛一样感受光线。有些动物在感受到不同的光的时候能够改变皮肤的颜色，即使在它们眼睛闭着的时候，因为松果体实际上是能够“看见”光线的。,"That pineal gland actually senses light the way your eyes would.Some animals can change their skin color when they sense different light—even if their eyes are closed—because the pineal gland actually ""sees"" the light."
8300,在人类身上，松果体起着同样的作用，但利用其他原理来感光。,"In humans, the pineal gland may work the same way but through other mechanisms that sense light."
8301,通过研究发现，运动员不同的跑步速度，确定了比赛这部分的步频和步长对速度的贡献比例。,Studies of the athletes running at various speeds have been performed to determine the relative contributions of stride frequency and length to velocity during this portion of the race.
8301,在相对低的速度（低于7m/s）时，步频和步长随着速度的增加呈线性上升。,"At relatively slow speeds (below 7 meters per second, or m/s), both stride rate and stride length increase in a linear fashion with rise in velocity."
8301,当然，步长的增加一定伴有肌肉力量产生的增加。,"Increases in stride length are, as expected, accompanied by parallel rise in production of muscle force."
8301,然而，一旦超过这个速度，步频的增加会超过既定速度的增加。,"Above this speed, however, stride rate increases more for a given increase in velocity."
8302,"儿童和青少年的磷酸果糖激酶(PFK)活性低于成年人这一事实也支持 上面的研究结果（Eriksson et al.，1973; Eriksson, 1980)。PFK是调节糖酵解的一个主要的酶。","Consistent with these observations is the fact that the activity of the enzyme PFK, a major regulator of glycolysis, is lower in children and adolescents than in adults (Eriksson etal., 1973; Eriksson, 1980)."
8302,"除此之外，儿童和青少年根本无法产生或承受文献所报道的成年人那样高的酸中毒（acidosis)水平（血 液pH值增高或械基减少）（Kindermann et al., 1975; Metejkova et al., 1980; Bar-Or, 1985) 。","In addition, children and adolescents are not able to generate or sustain levels of acidosis (as indicated by blood pH or base excess) as high as those reported in adults (Kindermann et al., 1975; Metejkova et al., 1980; Bar-Or, 1985)."
8303,许多肥胖症患者已经通过胃绕道手术成功瘦身。,Many obese people have received attention for losing weight from gastric bypass surgery.
8303,病人术后食量无法与从前一样，是因为很大一部分胃不再参与消化作用。,"After the surgery, people simply can't eat as much food because a major portion of their stomach has been excluded."
8303,但是近日研究者发现病人不会觉得饥饿的原因并非胃部变小，而是胃部能分泌促进食欲的饥饿激素的部分被切除了。,But researchers recently found out that part of the reason why they're not hungry isn't necessarily because their stomachs are smaller but because the segment of the stomach producing the appetite-inducing ghrelin hormone was removed.
8304,当脑垂体腺分泌过量时，肾上腺也会反映出分泌过量的皮质醇。,"When excess pituitary secretion happens, the adrenal glands respond by secreting excess cortisol."
8304,（这个过程就像一个激素的多米诺骨牌游戏，一种分泌诱发一连串的反应。,(The process is like a game of hormonal dominoes; one secretion triggers a chain of others.)
8304,）皮质醇控制着身体处理碳水化合物、脂肪、蛋白质的过程，还帮助身体减少发炎症状。,"Cortisol also controls the way the body processes carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, and helps the body reduce inflammation."
8305,该研究没有设立对照组来排除生长本身的作用。,This study did not include a control group to tease out the effects of growth per se.
8305,在另外一项没有对照的介入研究中，对西班牙15-17岁女孩和男孩在一年短跑、爆发力和力量训练前后进行测试。,"In another, uncontrolled intervention study, Spanish 15—17-year-old girls and boys were tested before and after a year of intense sprint, power and strength training."
8305,"股外侧肌活检发现I型和II型纤维的直径，I型纤维的比例, 糖原的含量增加了。糖原分解酶（磷酸果糖激酶和丙酮酸激酶）和氧化酶（琥珀酸脱氢酶和氨基酸转化酶）的活性加强了。","Biopsies of the vastus lateralis muscle revealed an increase in the diameter of both type I and II fibres, the proportion of type I fibres, the contents of glycogen, as well as the activity of glycolytic (phosphofructokinase and primarily pyruvate kinase) and oxidative (succinate dehydrogenase and amino acid transferases) enzymes."
8305,同样，由于缺乏对照，无法确定上述变化在多大程度上来自生长本身以及多大程度来自训练的结果。,"Again, the lack of controls does not allow to determine the extent to which the above changes resulted from growth per se and from training."
8306,不过，从留存至今的文字与图像中我们所能了解的是，那些极富传奇色彩的战士和运动员使用的自身体重训练法与今天广为人们熟知的“体操”几乎没有一点儿相似之处，远不是一种软绵绵的有氧训练。而更像是力量训练。,What we do know from the surviving descriptions and images was that the bodyweight training performed by these legendary warriors and athletes bore little resemblance to what is known as “calisthenics” today.
8306,事实上，他们的锻炼方法的确更适用于增强力量和爆发力。,"Rather than being a relatively soft form of aerobic training, their systems would have looked more like gymnastics, and would definitely have been geared more solidly to the progressive development or power and strength."
8307,用这些测定的数据来扩大现有的数据库，将为我们详细说明不同年龄和人种儿童的身体成分提供参照标准。,Expanding the current database with this in mind will provide the opportunity to define more appropriately the reference body composition of children at various ages within gender and racial groups.
8307,理论上，这一参照标准有助于更好地确定最低体重和肥胖的标准。,"Conceptually, the reference body can assist in the better definition of standards for minimal body weight and obesity."
8307,以FFB和实际的脂肪含量确定的最低体重的概念和标准，对于评定营养状态以及在诸如摔跤运动（采用体重分级的项目）中的应用均具有十分重大的意义。,"The concept and measurement of minimal body weight, which is defined by FFB and essential fat, is important for the evaluation of nutritional status and for application in sports such as wrestling in which weight classification systems are used."
8308,带有微机的简单的线性体重计功能稳定，可以进行校正，计算机能够进行系统的称重数值的校正。,"With access to microcomputers, simple non­linear scales that behave consistently can be calibrated and a computer algorithm used to make systematic corrections of scale values."
8308,每一名研究人员和临床医生的责任是对体重计进行校正。,The onus on every investigator and clinician is to calibrate weighing machines.
8308,一种简单的方法就是用杠铃片来精确称重并进行校正。,A simple way to do this is to have a set of barbell weights accurately weighed and stamped.
8308,,Sometimes this is possible at a governmental agency or private company.
8308,使用标准重量包（从小重量到2kg）就可以对体重计进行即时的评估。,Intermediate values can be assessed using a kit of known of weight standards of up to 2 kg.
8309,如果你已明白了要补充奶制品这个道理，就要确保摄入的奶制品是低脂或无脂的，因为摄入多余的脂肪通常会导致每天吸收过多的饱和脂肪（每日超过20克会使人衰老）。,"If you do hit the mark, make sure that you choose low-fat or fat-free versions of dairy foods, because the extra fat often leads to too much saturated fat a day (more than 20 grams a fay ages you)."
8309,饱和脂肪会引发动脉发炎，提高免疫系统系乱和癌症的发生率，并造成体重增加。之前已经说过，体重增加对骨骼和关节会产生负面影响。,"That saturated fat causes inflammation in your arteries, increases your chance of immune fysfunctions and cancer, and causes weight gain—which, as you know, can have a negative effect on  your bones and joints."
8310,"虽然在技术上体重指数（body mass index, BMI)不能归类为身体成分测量，但是它在临床和流行病学方面在成年人中得到了广泛的应用。体重指数只需要测量身髙和体重。","While BMI （body mass index) cannot be technically classified as a body composition measurement, it has received widespread use with adults in clinical and epidemiological assessments.BMI only requires measurement of height and body weight."
8310,它的定义就是体重/身髙的平方，以kg / m2表示。,It is defined as body weight/height2 and expressed as kg/m2.
8311,加强腹部肌肉力量以支撑背部的最简单的方法之一就是保持良好的姿势。,One of the easiest ways to strengthen your abdominal muscles and support your back一is through good posture.
8311,你自己可能觉得已经站得很直了，但实际上，我们大多数人的站姿都像比萨斜塔。,"You may feel like you're standing straight, but in reality, most of us stand like the Leaning Tower of Pisa."
8311,要训练良好的体姿，就要让头和脖子向后靠。,Practice good posture by bringing your head and neck back.
8312,"如果你只是刚刚开始训练,并且有空间或者预算限制,那么请记住:军队部署的训练场地只有沙袋和其他现成的设备,士兵们也一样可以进行有效的CrossFit训练。","If you’re just getting started and have space or budget restrictions, keep in mind that military units deployed to the field have designed effectiveCrossFit workouts using nothing more than a sandbag and other available equipment."
8312,"在美国俄亥俄州马里恩,在监狱里士兵进行 CrossFit训练[美国全国有色人种协进会(NAACP)项目的一部分], 他们的器械无非是跳绳和一间训练室。","And there is a group called the Fit for Life Crew in Marion, Ohio, doing CrossFit in prison (part of an NAACP program) with nothing more than a jump rope and a room to train in."
8312,"换句话说,训练不需要借口。","In other words, no excuses."
8313,选择效标对同时效度而言是极为重要的。,Choosing the criterion is critical in the concurrent validity method.
8313,同时效度能告诉你的仅仅是测量值与效标的相关程度。,All the correlation can tell you is the degree of relationship between a measure and the criterion.
8313,如果你选的效标不适当，那么同时效度的相关系数就失去意义了。,"If the criterion is inadequate, then the concurrent validity coefficient is of little consequence."
8314,自Glass从1976年引入统合分析以来，数以千计的统合分析文章陆续被发表，特别是在社会科学、行为科学，以及医学科学领域。,"Since Glass introduced meta-analysis in 1976, thousands of meta-analyses have been published, especially in the social, behavioral, and medical sciences."
8314,在1986年由美国国家卫生研究院所赞助的随机控制试验概述方法学议题工作坊（Workshop on Methodological Issues in Overviews of Randomized Clinical Trials )，与会者在以统合分析进行健康相关与医学研究之应用，皆投入可观的注意力。,"At a national conference in 1986 sponsored by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, Workshop on Methodological Issues in Overviews of Randomized Clinical Trials, participants focused considerable attention on meta-analysis for health-related and medical research."
8314,由Cooper与Hedges在1994年编着的《研究整合手册（The Handbook of ResearchSynthesis)》，仍然是规划与实施统合分析综评( meta-analytical review) 中最有用的信息来源之一。,"The Handbook o f Research Synthesis, edited by Cooper and Hedges (1994), is still one of the most useful sources of information for planning and conducting meta-analytical reviews."
8315,在本章的开头，我们就提到一些能用来描述资料特性、检验关联性、考验差异性的统计技术。,"At the beginning of this chapter, we stated that statistical techniques allow the description of data characteristics, the testing of relationships, and the testing of differences."
8315,然而，当我们讨论描述和推论（inference)时，我们并不是在讨论统计技术，即便这两个词有时候会与统计技术混淆了9这样的混淆是由于我们用相关来描述关联性，以及用群组间的差异考验技术来推论因果关系和影响效果。,"When we discuss description and inference, though, we are not discussing statistical techniques, although those two words are sometimes confused with statistical techniques.This confusion is the result of saying that correlations describe relationships and that cause and effect are inferred by techniques for testing differences between groups."
8315,这些陈述未必完全真实。,These statements are not necessarily true.
8316,"肌营养不良时，体力活动受限主要是由肌肉耐力因素引起的，而不是由氧运输系统的缺陷引起（Bar- Or, 1986)。","In MD, limitations on physical capacities are due to muscle endurance factors rather than due to deficiencies in the oxygen transport system (Bar-Or, 1986)."
8316,患杜兴型肌营养不良儿童的平均无氧功率减低，低于平均值2-4个标 准差以上（Bar-Or，1983)，“代谢指数” (最大无氧功率与最大有氧功率之比）下降（Bar-Or 1983)。霍斯金等（1976) 也报告，肌营养不良患儿在抬头和举腿 45°测定时，肌肉耐力下降。,"Mean anaerobic power is reduced by as much as 2 —4 SD below the mean (Bar-Or, 1983) and there is a reduced ‘metabolic index' (ratio of peak anaerobic to peak aerobic power) (Bar-Or, 1983) in children with D uchenne's M D. Hosking et al. (1976) also reported reduced muscle endurance as measured by 450 head and leg lift in children with MD."
8317,考虑到这些青年退出运动问题的貌似合理的解释，研究人员意识到，单纯地去探讨退出原因不再重要。,"Given these plausible explanations for youth sport withdrawal, researchers have realized that simply identifying reasons for sport withdrawal may no longer be appropriate."
8317,相反，更好地理解影响儿童退出运动的因素应该成为研究的重点。,"Rather, a better understanding of the factors influencing a child's decision to drop out of sport should be the primary focus of youth sport withdrawal research."
8317,本章采用过程分析法重点分析可能导致儿童退出运动的因素。,This chapter is structured to examine youth sport withdrawal from a process-oriented approach focusing on factors that may contribute to the child's withdrawal from sport.
8318,"泰纳（Theiner,2003)解释伤病是造成尼卡宁失败赛季的原因，也是导致他退役的终极原因。",Theiner (2003) explained that injuries caused Nykanen's unsuccessful season and were the ultimate reason for Nykanen's retirement.
8318,在1991年世界锦标赛之前，尼卡宁接受了一次膝盖手术，导致他一整年不能参加训练。,Nykanen had a knee operation and could not practice during the year preceding the World Championships in 1991.
8318,在他的运动生涯中，尼卡宁一共接受了四次膝盖手术，在从跳台滑雪界退役之后他还接受了两次背部手术。,"During his career, Nykanen had four knee operations; he later underwent two back operations after retiring from ski jumping."
8319,在讨论昼夜节律、时差反应和运动表现时，不可能不提到褪黑素，它可能充当着视交叉上核内生物钟与明-暗循环之间的介质。,"No discussion of circadian rhythms, jet lag, and sports performance would be complete without a mention of melatonin, which may serve as the mediator by which the biological clock in the suprachiasmatic  nucleus (SCN) is linked to light-dark cycles."
8319,褪黑素是由松果体在由天模式下分泌的，它受光的影响非常强烈。,Melatonin is secreted by the pineal gland in a diurnal fashion that is very strongly influenced by light.
8319,在晚上黑暗时，褪黑素的分泌水平是白天的30倍。,Levels during the dark of night can be 30 times greater than  in the daytime.
8319,视交叉上核上遍布褪黑素受体，据推测，是为了与明-暗循环保持一致。,"And the SCN is equipped with melatonin receptors, presumably to stay in tune with light-dark cycles."
8320,学习调动核心肌肉发力。,Learn to engage your core muscles.
8320,麦肯齐建议，在日常生活中分配25%的时间使用核心肌肉支撑躯干活动。,MacKenzie recommends turning on the muscles supporting your trunk to about a constant 25 percent level of engagement.
8320,收紧臀部肌肉和腹部肌肉，就像你准备着在胃部挨一拳的感觉，保持该姿势15分钟后放松。,"Do this by squeezing the glute muscles and locking the ab muscles, as if you were bracing for a punch to the stomach, then dial it down to about a quarter effort."
8320,这套简单的动作可以帮助你纠正骨盆至一个健康的位置。,This simple sequence will brace the pelvis into healthy position.
8320,在你站立、走路或者跑步时，都可以做这个动作，在坐下之前注意保持下脊椎正直。,"Do this when you’re standing, when you are walking or running, and before you sit down with a well-braced lower spine."
8321,布里尔等（Brill et al.，1989)研究了参加高中或大学竞技运动队的345名25~60岁的男子。,Brill et al. (1989) studied 345 men aged 25-60 years who had participated in competitive sports teams in high school or college.
8321,当与75名非运动员对照组比较时，原运动员在成年期的经常体力活动的水平是没有差别的。,Level of regular physical activity during adult years was not different in the former athletes when compared to 75 non-athlete control subjects.
8321,两组之间的大多数冠心病的危险因素（体重指数，血清脂质状况和血压）是类似的。,"Most coronary risk factors (body mass index, serum lipid profile and blood pressure) were similar in the two groups."
8322,我们所知道关于预防癌症的显而易见的方法来自食物和营养。,Some of the clearest evidence we have about preventing cancer comes in the form of food and nutrients.
8322,也就是说，避免并不是第一种防御措施（像皮肤癌和肺癌），而是要通过营养。,"That is, in cases where avoidence isn't the first defense (like skin and lung cancer), nutrition is."
8322,除虫专家自有他们的药物、药剂和毒药来把害虫清除出你的房子，但是你的灭癌药剂却来自不同类型的营养和维生素。,"Exterminators have their own set of chemicals, potions, and poisons they use to keep citters out of your house, but your cancer-fighting potions come in the form of a variety of nutrients and vitamins."
8323,研究表明维生素的确降低了癌症的发生率，流行病学研究和试管实验都证明了这一点。,Research has shown that vitamin D does decrease the risk of cancer—in both epidemiological and test-tube stuides.
8323,有一种理论说某种形式的维生素D能够杀死基因突变细胞，也就是说维生素D也许对于潜在的癌细胞是致命杀手。第二个理论是说维生素D能够帮助纠错基因找到癌细胞，并置之于死地，这就像给纠错基因准备的放大镜。,Onr theory is that a form of the vitamin actually kills cell mutations—meaning that D might be toxic to potentially cancerous cells and cause them to die—sort of acting like a magnifying glass for the proofreader gene.
8324,复合维生素剂（同时摄取含有少含脂肪的食物），包含至少400亳克的叶酸；1000国际单位的维生素D；1200毫克的钙；400毫克的镁和日均值的其他维生素。一日分两次，每次服食总摄入量的一半。,"Multivitamin (taken with a little fat) that contains at least 400 micrograms of folate, 1,000 IU of vitamin D, 1200 milligrams of calcium, 400 milligrams of megnesium, and a daily value (DV) of all others; it's actually best for optimal body levels and absorption to take half of the total twice a day."
8324,如果你正在服用斯达汀（降E固醇药）就要减少维生素C和维生素E的量。,(Reduce doses of vitamins C and E if you are takig a statin.)
8325,如果人体补充维生素超过这一剂量，维生素A就不能起到抗氧化效果，而是会起相反作用，造成细胞氧化、基因受损。,"When you get more than that amount from supplements of vitamins, it doesn't serve its purpose as an antioxidant.In fact, it does the opposite and oxidizes tissue, which causes DNA damage."
8325,芬兰的一项研究表明，补充维生素A的人患肺癌、动脉粥样硬化的可能性升高，而补充维生素A的吸烟者则更易得中风。,"One study from Finland showed that people taking vitamin A had a higher risk of lung cancer, atherosclerosis, and, for smokers, stroke."
8325,因此，应将维生素A摄入量控制在每天1500到2500国际单位之间。,"So keep your vitamin supplement dose to 1,500 to 2,500 IU a day."
8326,进食后很快就躺下，会让胃酸向上流回食道，令你产生灼热感，强化胃食道反流的症状。,"Lying down so soon after eating encourages the flow of acid back up your esophagus so you get that burning taste, which will intensify the symptoms of GERD."
8326,进食时要避开那些促进胃食道反流发展的因素，例如辣味饮食、咖啡因和酒精。,"While you're at it, avoid GERD-promoting items like foods or beverages containing pepper or peppers, caffeine, and alcohol."
8326,有些药 片如果不伴水服下，也会引发胃食道反流（这些情况是因人而异的)。,Some pills can also cause GERD if you don’t take them with water (these are individual to the person).
8327,温盖特无氧试验结果显示，肌营养不良儿童的最大输出功率和平均输出功率均在正常值以下。,Both peak and mean power output as assessed by the Wingate anaerobic test are subnormal in children with MD.
8327,温盖特无氧试验结果并体重校正后显示，6-14岁儿童的无氧能力和耐力均明显减低。,Anaerobic power and endurance in children 6-14 years of age was significantly reduced on the Wingate anaerobic test when corrected for body wreight.
8327,中度和严重脑瘫患者最大功率输出和平均功率输出低于正常值3-4个标准差。,Peak and mean power output was 3-4 SD below normal in moderate to severe CP.
8328,沃尔夫氏定律的另一个人体例子是由休斯敦发现的，他研究了一名先天性胫骨缺失的男孩。,"Another example of Wolff's law, this time with a human model, has been documented by Houston in a case study of a boy born with only one instead of two bones in the lower leg (congenital absence of the tibia)."
8328,在2岁时，骨科医生为他移植了一根腓骨（腓骨通常是细小的支撑长骨），位于股骨之下以便负重。,"Orthopaedic surgeons operated on this handicapped infant when he was 2 years old and moved the fibula, which is normally a thin strut bone, centrally beneath the femur so that it could bear weight."
8328,男孩3.5岁时，经过18个月负重后，那个承担胫骨工作的腓骨在大小、形态和力量方面基本上与缺损的胫骨一样。,"When this boy was 3.5 years old, after 18 months of weight-bearing, the fibula which was doing the work of the tibia assumed essentially the size, shape and strength of the missing tibia."
8329,信度系数（coefficient of reliability）是真实分数的变异量与观察分数变异量的比率。,The coefficient of reliability is the ratio of true score variance to observed score variance.
8329,由于真实分数的变异量无法得知，因此要以观察分数变异量减去误差分数变异量来估计。,"Because true score variance is never known, it is estimated by subtracting error variance from observed score variance."
8329,因而信度系数反映的是测量值不受误差变异量影响的程度。,"Thus, the reliability coefficient reflects the degree to which the measurement is free of error variance."
8330,女士们经常会做膝盖俯卧撑，因为她们的上肢力量相对较弱，不易完成标准俯卧撑，不过这个动作对男士也大有好处。,"Women often do kneeling pushups because they lack the relative upper body strength to perform the full pushup, but this exercise offers great benefits to guys as well."
8330,对那些超重或身材走形的人来说，膝盖俯卧撑是不错的起点。因为采用这样的姿势推起上半身相对容易，所以在开始做更难的俯卧撑之前，膝盖俯卧撑是绝佳的热身练习。,"It’s a good starting exercise for somebody who’s maybe overweight or out of shape, and because you can pump up the upper body with relative ease in this position, kneeling pushups make an excellent warm up exercise you can do before attempting harder forms of pushup."
8331,最后，战斗消灭了细菌，但也牺牲了T细胞和B细胞，留下一摊垃圾（这被称作细胞自杀机制，是T细胞和B细胞的自我摧毀，为避免它们伤害健康的细胞）。,"Finally, that battle leaves the bacteria dead, but it also kills the T and B cells, leaving a pool of waste behind (its called apoptosis—the T and B cells self-destruct so they don't destroy healthy cells)."
8331,这一摊废物使皮下造成压力，从而形成了为这场战斗提供新血液的红色供给线和为此做出反应的白细胞所产生的白色脓液。,"This pool of waste builds up pressure under the skin, creating redness from new blood supply lines coming to battle and pus from the white blood cells responding to the scene."
8331,战斗剩下的废物就像火山一样升至皮肤表面形成丘疹。,"Like a volcano, the waste material rises to the surface to form the pimple."
8332,当然，要完成呼吸过程，肺的其他组成部分也是必不可少的。,"Of course, your lungs also have other parts that are integral to the breathing process."
8332,支气管负责清理肺部环境。,Your bronchial tubes are responsible for cleaning out your lungs.
8332,肺就像小块的生日蛋糕，表面包裹着黏液，黏附着灰尘和微生物。,"Typically, they’re like a four-year-old’s birthday cake covered with mucus, which dirt and germs stick to."
8332,肺部还有上百万根被称为纤毛的细小绒毛。,Your lungs also have millions of tiny hairs called cilia.
8332,纤毛的作用像小扫帚，将所有黏在黏液上的杂物统统扫走。,Cilia act like little brooms that sweep away all the stuff that s caught in your mucus.
8333,但是，完全性房室传导阻滞的患者在剧烈运动时，心率很少能够达到每分钟 90~110次。,"People with complete congenital heart block, however, rarely attain a heart rate of greater than 90—100 beats-m in ' 1 during vigorous exercise."
8333,一般需要进行运动试验来确定这些患者的运动限度。,Often an exercise test is required to establish the limits of their physical activity.
8333,具有心率反应特性的起搏器对于这些病人参加剧烈运动是非常有帮助的。,A rate responsive pacemaker is very helpful in allowing these individuals to participate in vigorous physical activity.
8333,在允许参加运动之前，他们必须得到医生的检查和治疗。,They should be under the care of a physician before being allowed to participate.
8334,"变项彼此相互影响的方式并非总是清楚的。例如,X—Y—Z或者X—Y—Z 。在第一个 情况,X 影响著Y ,Y接着影响Z ;但是在第二个情况下,Y 影响著X和Z。这是个简单的实例。","The way variables influence one another is not always clear; for example, X -» / - » Z, or X -» T Z. In the first case, X influences Y, which in turn influences Z, but in the second case, Y influences both X and Z. This is a simple example."
8334,路径分析和线性结构关系使得变项相互影响的模型方式可以变得更加复杂,Path analysis and LISREL allow a more complex modeling of the way variables influence one another.
8335,这其实就是内分泌系统所负责的工作。这个全身性腺体系统能释放基本的激素以保持身体调整到筋佳状态并工作正常，使你感到舒适。,That's really the job of your endocrine system: a system of glands throughout your body that releases essential hormones to keep your body fine-tuned to function well and comfortably.
8335,大多数激素的工作都类似祖母做的事：她们做了好事却不让任何人注意到，你的生活幸福全是因为她们。,"Most of these hormones do Grandma's work; they perform good deeds without anyone ever noticing, and you live a good life because of all they do."
8336,胜算比的解释如同在世代研究中所估算的相对风险。,The odds ratio is interpreted as an estimate of the relative risk that would have been calculated in the study group if a cohort study had been conducted.
8336,胜算比的虚无值是1.0。,"Like the relative risk, the null value of the odds ratio is 1."
8336,当值高于1.0代表风险增加;小于1.0表示风险下降。,"0. Values above 1.0 typically indicate increased risk, and values less than 1.0 indicate reduced risk."
8337,相关系数(coefficient of correlation)是两个以上变项之间的关系定量值，其范围可包含正或负的.00 到1.,The coefficient of correlation is a quantitative value of the relationship between two or more variables.The correlation coefficient can range from .00 to 1.00 in either a positive or negative direction.
8337,0 0 。因此，完美相关是1.0 0 ( +1.00 或 -1.00)，而完全不相关是.00。欲了解完美相关性和无相关性的例子，请参考充电站:「相关性：完美和没那麽完美」。,"Thus, perfect correlation is 1.00 (either +1.00 or -1.00), and no relationship at all is .00 (see the sidebar Correlation: Perfect and Not So Perfect for examples of perfect correlations and examples of no correlation)."
8338,知识测量很明显是体育、运动科学教育中的基础部分。,"Obviously, the measurement of knowledge is a fundamental part of the educational aspects of physical education, exercise science, and sport science."
8338,"同时,建构知识测验也与研究目的有关。",But the construction of knowledge tests is relevant for research purposes as well.
8338,"对多数在研究中使用的纸笔测量工具建立信效度的程序,与之前讨论的程序相似。","The procedures for establishing the validity and reliability of most pencil-and-paper measuring instmments used in research are similar to the procedures previously discussed.That is, we must perform item analysis."
8338,"也就是说我们必须进行项目分析 (关于知识测验方法论更详尽的讨论,请参阅 Mood, 1989) °","(For a more thorough discussion of measurement methodology for knowledge tests, see Mood, 1989.)"
8339,项目难度(item difficulty)的分析通常不难完成。,The analysis of item difficulty is usually accomplished easily.
8339,只要简单的以答对题目的人数除以回答题目的总人数便可得到。,You simply divide the number of people who correctly answered the item by the number of people who responded to the item.
8339,"例如,如果80个人回答题目,60个人答对,则此项目的难度指标为.75 (60/80)。一个题目越难,其难度指标越低。","For example, if 80 people answered an item and 60 answered it correctly, the item would have a difficulty index of .75 (60 / 80)."
8340,看看哮喘病人的肺部图片（见图5.1)，想象一下，如果在你深呼吸后，支气管夹上一把钳子，将肺部的气体全部抽空，这时的感觉如何？,Take a look at the picture of lungs affected by asthma (see Figure 5.1) and imagine what happens if you take a deep breath and then clamp a vise on the bronchus that drains air from the lung.
8340,空气挤在阻塞点处，想向下活动却毫无办法，如同一只倒置的装着水的瓶子。,The air stays bottled up at the point of obstruction.
8340,你会听到一声哨音，当气流穿过通风系统受阻时，这种声音还会变大。,You hear a whistling sound and the noise intensifies when the airflow has trouble making it through the ventilation system.
8340,这就是哮喘。,That's asthma.
8341,有些作者报告，有的哮喘患者不是即刻，而是在4-10小时后发生呼气气流迟发的下降，同时伴有胸闷、哮鸣或两者并存。,"It has been reported by some investigators that some patients with asthma will suffer not just an immediate but also a late reduction in expiratory airflow, 4-10 h later, associated with chest tightness, wheezing or both."
8341,有迟发反应的患者出现血中NCF水平增高，但即刻反应的患者只出现即刻NCF升高。出现这种迟发反应患者的循环NCF水平很低，而出现即刻反应的那些患者的NCF水平只在早期上升。,"Patients who experience these late responses have been shown to have increased circulating levels of NCF, while those patients who have only the immediate response have only an initial rise in NCF."
8342,像台阶冲刺跑和推汽车一样，消防员冲刺跑对我们的心肺功能、心血管耐力、腿部的新陈代谢及全身的能量生成都极有好处。,"Like stair sprints and car pushing, fireman sprint is great for heart and lung capacity, cardiovascular stamina, leg metabolism and total body energy generation."
8342,这是一项很有趣又很有难度的运动，像任何一种涉及外在负重的练习一样，它本身也有危险。,"It’s an interesting and demanding technique, but—like any exercise involving external loads—there are inherent risks."
8342,你要好好热身，而且要穿着结实的靴子，以保护脚踝。此外，在整个练习过程中都要保持精神集中。,"Warm up well, wear solid boots to protect your ankles and retain mental focus throughout the exercise."
8342,该方法不仅在消防员中很流行，在保镖中也广泛使用，因为他们可能需要背着保护对象迅速脱离险境。,"This method isn’t only popular with firefighters; it’s also used extensively by bodyguards and close protection specialists, who might have to carry a client out of a dangerous area quickly."
8343,耳蜗旁边就是前庭迷宫——三条位于不同轴上的系列导管。,Next to the cochlea resides a vestibular labyrinth—three serial canals all on different axes from one another.
8343,它们负责控制人的旋转运动，特别是在提供有关你所处的空间位置的信息方面。,They are responsible for rotational movement—specifically in terms of giving you the information about where you are in space.
8343,这是构成你的平衡系统的四种器官之一。（另外三个是你的视觉，它能帮你纠正平衡问题；你的本体感受，它负责告诉你身体器官相对的空间位置；还有你的小脑，它统合其他几部分为你提供平衡。）,"Its one of the four things that make up your balancing system (the other three are your vision, which helps correct balance problems; proprioception, which is responsible for telling you where your body parts are relative to space; and your cerebellum, which integrates all the other parts to give you balance)."
8344,小腿围（calf girth)。,Calf girth.
8344,当受试者站立，体重平均分布在双脚时，小腿的最大围度。,Maximum perimeter of the calf when the subject stands with weight equally distributed on both feet.
8344,进行测量时，要确保测到的数值是最大的，这就要用拇指和食指松紧卷尺并用中指确保测量时卷尺是与腿的长轴呈直角。,"Make this measurement by manipulation of the tape taking a series of girth measurements to assure the largest value, loosening and snubbing of the tape with your thumbs and index finger grips and levelling with your third digit to ensure the measurement is obtained when the tape is perpendicular to the long axis of the leg."
8345,通过小众媒体，滑板运动开创并推崇一种倡导年轻独立和放荡不羁的生活方式，主要吸引十几岁的白人男性。,"Through its niche media, skateboarding created and sold a lifestyle that embraced youthful independence and an outlaw masculinity which attracted primarily teenaged White males."
8345,20世纪90年代，这种“打包”的生活方式使得这一很抢手的群体很容易被滑板之外的东西所吸引。,"In the 1990s this ""packaged"" lifestyle made this highly sought-after demographic easily targeted by those outside of skateboarding."
8345,极限运动比赛的故事体现了这一趋势。,The story of the X Games exemplifies this trend.
8346,史密斯（1986)将基于竞赛应激造成的退出运动和心理耗竭的退出加以区别。,Smith (1986) differentiates between the sport burnout and sport drop-out based on cognitive-affective issues resulting from competitive stress.
8346,史密斯特另将心理耗竭的退出定义为因慢性应激引起的心理、情感和身体减退的一种退出。,"Specifically, Smith defines bum-out as the psychological, emotional and physical withdrawal from sport resulting from chronic stress."
8346,另一方面，单纯退出是兴趣改变和（或）价值观念转换所致，是本章探讨的重点。,"Drop-out, on the other hand, results from a change of interests and/or value reorientation and is the focus of this chapter."
8347,"进行上述检查的大多数儿童都会被诊断为肌肉骨骼系统引起的胸痛（Duster, 1990)。","The majority of children who undergo such an evaluation are diagnosed with musculoskeletal chest pain (Duster, 1990)."
8347,心前区暂停吸气综合征（precordial catch syndrome)也是经过检查的儿童胸痛的常见的一个原因。,Precordial catch syndrome is also a frequent cause of chest pain in children who have been evaluated.
8347,儿童真正由心血管系统引起的胸痛是很少见的。,True cardiovascular origin of chest pain in children is rare.
8348,常见的瓣膜问题是二尖脱垂。,"The most common valve problem is matral valve prolapse (the name ""mitral"", by the way, comes from miter, the two-leaved hat worn by popes), in which the valve between the left atrium and left ventricle doesn't slam closed fully, just like in Figure"
8348,"补充一句，“二尖瓣”这个词源自“主教冠”,它是主教戴的帽子，有两个尖。",2.
8348,如图2.3所示，位于左心房和左心室之间的瓣膜不能正常闭合。,3.
8349,在51例死亡病例中，23例发生在胸部被球击中后继发死亡。,Of the 51 deaths 23 occurring during this period were secondary to being struck in the chest by the ball.
8349,"外力通过胸壁作用于心肌而导致的心脏破裂是棒球中最常见的创伤致死因素 (Abrunzo, 1991)。","Commotio cordis, which occurs secondary to forces generated through the chest wall to the myocardium, has been recognized as the most common cause of traumatic death in baseball (Abrunzo, 1991)."
8349,与成年人相比，青少年被球击中时，其相对薄的胸壁就会将更大的能量传递到心肌，导致致命的心律失常或心律不齐发生。,"When struck with a baseball, the relatively thin, compliant chest wall of a child is thought to transmit greater energy to the myocardium than that of the adult, resulting in fatal dysrhythmias or arrythmia."
8349,第二类最常见的致死性损伤原因为头部被球击中而继发闭合性颅脑损伤。,The next most common category of injury resulting in death involves the head being struck by the ball and consequent closed head injury.
8349,"头胸部被击中最常见于击球和投球时（Rutherford, 1981)。",The greatest risk of being struck in the chest or head is incurred while batting or pitching (Rutherford 1981).
8350,用汤罐或书做些简单的举重运动，可以对肌肉起到刺激作用，进而促进新陈代谢，身体便开始消耗脂肪。,Doing simple exercises with soup cans or books will stimulate your muscles in new ways—and will begin the process of kick- starting your metabolism so your body can burn off.
8350,若是想长寿，今天就幵始锻炼吧。,"If you want to live longer, start today."
8350,你的家人，还有你变得年轻的身体，会感谢你的。,Your family —and your younger body—will thank you.
8351,本能的动作，如吮吸动作就可以在未满月婴儿（新生儿）睡眠状态下看到。,"Spontaneous movement patterns, such as mouthing, can be observed in neonates in a drowsy state."
8351,这种动作常常是有节奏性的，被称为节奏定型动作。,"They are often rhythmical, in which case they are called rhythmical stereotypies."
8351,婴儿在1岁期间表现出大量的节奏定型动作，诸如踢腿、身体波浪运动、身体弯曲、身体摇摆、跳跃等等。,"During their first year, infants perform a great variety of stereotypies, such as kicking, waving, banging, rocking, bouncing, and so on."
8351,在不同年龄时出现不同的节奏定型动作，并且在不同年龄时某些节奏定型动作突出。,The different stereotypies appear and peak at different ages.
8352,相较那些缺失的或是隐匿的，新同性恋恐惧症也体现在包括两个女人在内的叙事中。,"Neo-homophobia was also manifest in narratives in what was included about the two women, compared to what was missing or concealed."
8352,在波特兰的兴衰过程中，她的故事，包括她的家人和孩子在内是丰满的；在查特曼的故事中，家庭和私人关系几乎不存在。,"During the rise and fall of Portland stories including her family and children were ample, while for Chatman family and personal relationships were virtually nonexistent."
8352,那些被包含的和被排斥的部分允许同时建构和否定异性恋主义及同性恋恐惧症。,What was included and excluded permitted the simultaneous construction and denial of heterosexism and homophobia.
8353,自然界里是没有真空的。,Nature abhors a vacuum.
8353,任何信息的空洞都会被一些人以某种方式填补。,Any information void will be filled somehow by someone.
8353,"媒体是有截稿日期的，这驱使它们很快地填补信息空洞 … … 如果危机团队不向媒体提供最初的危机信息，其他的一些可能不了解情况的或是被误导的、被激发积极性的团体就会伤害到这个组织（2007, p. 129)。","The media have deadlines, so they are driven to fill the information void quickly.. . .If the crisis team does not supply the initial crisis information to the media, some other groups will, and they may be ill informed, misinformed, or motivated to harm the organization.(2007, p. 129)"
8354,本章探求大众传媒是如何描绘那些坠落的体育英雄的，同时也为同类人提供恢复各自形象的曝光机会。,This chapter examines how the mass media portray fallen sports heroes yet also provide the exposure for those same individuals to restore their respective images.
8354,这一章从定位基本的新闻价值开始。,The chapter begins by addressing basic news values.
8354,"接下来，本章回顾了议程设置理论框架（McCombs，2004)、框架及归因(Heider,1958；Iyengar, 1991)以及例证理论( Zillmann,1999),而后梳理了危机传播及形象恢复的研究成果(Allen & Caillouet, 1994；Benoit,1997；Coombs, 2007)。","It then reviews theoretical frameworks in agenda setting (McCombs, 2004), framing and attribution (Heider, 1958; Iyengar, 1991), and exemplification (Zillmann, 1999), before covering work in crisis communication and image restoration (Allen & Caillouet, 1994; Benoit, 1997; Coombs, 2007)."
8355,我们处理外界信息，一般是将信息从感觉器官直接送至脑皮层，我们可以在这里处理感知到的信息。,"We usually process outside information by passing it directly from the sensory organ to the cortex, where we process what we have learned."
8355,人眼将图像信息送至丘脑，人耳将声音和平衡信息送至顶骨叶。,The eyes send images to the occipital lobe; and the ears send sound and balance information to the parietal lobe.
8355,但是，嗅觉的情况比较特殊。,But smell is unique.
8355,气味通过位于鼻梁顶端的槽状软骨，刺激嗅球神经。,An odor passes through the cribiform plate at the top of the nose and stimulates the olfactory nerve.
8355,这种神经绕过能过滤信息的脑皮质，将信息送至人脑最初始的部分（杏仁核），在这里，情感反应几乎都是由潜意识产生的。,"This nerve bypasses the cortex, which filters information, and sends the information to the most ancient part of our brain (amygdala), where emotional responses occur almost subconsciously."
8356,该年龄组女孩大腿最大无氧功率（PP)和平均无氧功率（MP)大约相当于同龄男孩的75%。,"For these older age groups, leg PP and MP of girls represent about 75% those of boys."
8356,当以每公斤体重表示时，女孩大腿PP值从11岁开始就已经明显低于男孩。,"When expressed per kilogram of body mass, leg PP of girls is significantly lower than in boys, already from the age of 11 ."
8356,对于该年龄组而言，女孩大腿PP·kg-1大约是12岁男孩的85%，18岁男孩的70%。,"For these age groups, leg PP· kg-1 represents about 85% that of boys at age 12 and about 70% at the age of 18 years."
8356,"采用其他测试方（Wirth et al., 1978; Gregor et al., 1979; Berger, 1982; Bar -Or, 1983; Simoneau et al., 1983; Sargent et al., 1984; Verschuur, 1987; Matsudo, 1988; Barabas & Eiben, 1991; Buchard, 1991; Beunen et al., 1992)或者使用其他有关参照测量指标(净体重或大腿肌肉横截面积）（Berger, 1982; Murphy et al., 1984; Verschuur, 1987; Weijiang & Juxiang, 1988; Serresse et al., 1989; Simoneau & Bouchard., 1989; Barabas & Eiben, 1991; Malina & Bouchard, 1991, Beunen et al.，1992)的研究也有相似的性别差异存在。","Similar gender-related differences have been reported using other test protocols (Wirth et al., 1978; Gregor et al., 1979; Berger, 1982; Bar-Or, 1983; Simoneau et al., 1983; Sargent et al., 1984; Verschuur, 1987; Matsudo, 1988; Barabas & Eiben, 1991; Bouchard, 1991; Beunen et al., 1992) and/or other relevant reference measures (FFM or thigh cross-sectional area) (Berger, 1982; Murphy et al., 1984; Verschuur, 1987; Weijiang & Ju xiang, 1988; Serresse et al., 1989; Simoneau & Bouchard, 1989; Barabas & Eiben, 1991; Malina & Bouchard, 1991; Beunen et al., 1992)."
8357,胸廓前后径（ anteroposterior chest depth)。,Anteroposterior chest depth.
8357,使用大范围伸展的夹子或者用双臂弯曲度大的人体测量计作为滑动夹子测量胸骨中点水平的胸廓的前后径。,Depth of the chest at mesosternale level obtained with spreading caliper or anthropometer with recurved branches used as a sliding caliper.
8357,在受试者取笔直坐位时，从其右侧进行测量比较容易。,This measure is easiest to obtain from the right side of a subject seated in an erect posture.
8357,采用夹子向下跨过右肩，用右手中指放在胸骨中点略下方，像握铅笔一样将夹子臂的顶点对准部位。,Apply the caliper over the right shoulder in a downward direction.Anchor slightly below the mesosternale with the third digit of your right hand and manipulate the tip of the branch to the site as if you were grasping a pencil.
8358,称它们为天生的杀手细胞也十分恰当。,Some directly destroy the intruders and are aptly named natural killer cells.
8358,当你还是个孩子的时候，你的胸腺位于心脏的前面，大小与心尺寸相当。,"When you were a child, your thymus, which is located in front of your heart, was actually the size of your heart."
8358,（事实上，胸腺的尺寸很大，医生们在给儿童做心脏外科手术时，他们必须得艰难地透过胸腺才能找到心脏。）,"(In fact, it was so big that when doctors do heart surgery on children, they have to fight through the thymus just to find the heart.)"
8359,回到叙事理论，关于《开放》很有趣的一点是，阿加西明确地承认了这本书代表他人生故事的一个“版本”。,"To return to narrative theory, one of the interesting aspects of Open is Agassi's explicit acknowledgment that the book represents a version of his life story."
8359,"人类发展学学者提倡“老化的诗学”, “当我们解读自己的生活时，强调我们行动中的创造性主体” 。","Human development scholars advocate for a ""poetics of aging"" that ""emphasizes the creative agency in what we do as we interpret our lives""."
8359,从这个角度来看，每个生活都能被视为一个文本或是小说，“ 在这之中，自己同时是作者、叙述者、主角和读者”。,"From this perspective, every life can be seen as a text or a novel, ""of which one is simultaneously author, narrative, character, and reader""."
8360,膝盖锁定、不使用惯性做直举腿相当难，500个认真的训练者里可能就有一个人能完成——没准更少。,"Straight leg raises, performed with locked knees and without momentum are an incredibly hard exercise—only perhaps one in five hundred serious trainees (maybe less) can execute them."
8360,该动作如此困难的原因之一是动作幅度大（身体从完全伸展到完全直角的姿势）。,One of the things that makes them so hard is the full range of motion—from the body straight all the way up to the jackknife right angle position.
8360,训练者一旦获得在最高点将腿伸直（即悬垂蛙举腿的结果）所需的力量和柔韧性，就可以练习悬垂半举腿。该动作使上半幅度的动作更难一些，并去除了下半幅度的动作。,"Once the athlete has developed the strength and flexibility required to perform the legs extended top position (as a result of hanging frog raises), hanging partial straight leg raises capitalize on this, by making the top position a little harder, and eliminating the rest."
8361,悬垂屈举腿是悬垂屈膝的延伸，难度更大。,Hanging bent leg raises are a harder extension of hanging knee raises.
8361,悬垂屈膝时膝盖要弯曲成90°，而悬垂屈举腿时膝盖则要成45°。,"In hanging knee raises, the knees are bent at ninety degrees, in hanging bent leg raises they are at forty-five."
8361,增长的力臂使得悬垂屈举腿成为到目前为止最难的中段练习。,"The increased leverage this provides makes the exercise the hardest in the series yet, and it develops the midsection accordingly."
8361,你的腹肌、腰部肌肉、前锯肌、髋部屈肌都会变得更强壮。,"The abdomen, waist, serratus and hip flexors all get stronger."
8362,从悬垂屈膝开始，训练者将开始举腿系列中更难的悬垂动作。,"With the hanging knee raise, the athlete begins the harder hanging movements of the midsection series."
8362,在地板上练习时，训练者只需部分地克服重力，而现在必须完全克服重力。,"While on the floor, the athlete was only partially fighting the forces of gravity; now he has to overcome gravity fully."
8362,这种变化会在短时间内急剧增强髋部与身体中段的力量。,"The increased intensity amplifies hip and midsection strength radically, in a short space of time."
8362,此外，在横杆上悬垂，也增加了胸腔肌肉（如前锯肌与肋间肌，它们在手臂和腹部之间起连接作用）的活动性。,In addition the bar hang element increases the activity of the important ribcage muscles (the serratus and intercostals) which function as intermediaries between the arms and abdomen.
8362,因此，在横杆上进行悬垂举腿练习比在双杠或类似设备上练习效果更好。,For this reason hanging ab work is vastly superior to ab work on parallel bars or similar devices.
8363,若根据上述规定严格练习，那么悬垂直举腿将是世界上最伟大的中段练习动作，卷腹、器械练习和负重仰卧起坐都相形见绌。,"Hanging straight leg raises—performed strictly, according to the protocols given above—are the greatest all-round midsection exercise in existence.They blow crunches, machine work, and weighted sit-ups out of the water."
8363,如果你能完美无缺地做上20次悬垂直举腿，那你的腰部将无比强大和灵活，腹外斜肌、前锯肌、腹横肌和肋间肌将犹如岩石般坚硬突出，腹肌也会像钢板般结实。,"By the time you can execute even twenty perfect reps of this exercise, your waist will be powerful and flexible, your obliques, serratus, transversus and intercostals will be carved out of solid rock and your abdominal muscles will be like plate steel."
8363,你将拥有魔鬼六块！,You will have a six-pack from hell!
8364,你的大脑实际上是同时患有几种认知疾病的集合，如神经细胞丧失或纠结，还有血管问题，这都会造成记忆功能的丧失。,"Your brain is really a pot of several cognitive ailments at once —— some neuron loss, some neuron tangling, some vascular problems——that all contribute to losing some ability to recall information."
8364,随着年龄增大，我们所有人的身体实际上都会或多或少地出现这些问题。,"In fact, almost all of us have some of these characteristics as we age."
8364,不论医师的正规沴断如何，我们都需要注意以下几点。,"Whatever the official diagnosis, there are several points to remember."
8365,你的肾脏还在调节血压方面起着关键的作用，并且这种作用有踪迹可寻，因为它们处于理想的位置来测量流入肾脏的血压。,Your kidneys also play a very traceable and key role in regulating blood pressure because they are ideally positioned to measure the pressure of blood pushing into them.
8365,如果压力差很低，就像我的祖先在被剑齿虎咬伤后，肾脏就会维持体液以保持身体的血压；但是当它们过分行动或是开小差时，就需要一种高血压，肾脏就会很快做出调整。,"If the pressure head is low, like after our ancestors were bitten by a saber-tiger, they hold on to fluid to maintain our blood pressure.But when they overreact or are misled into thinking we need a higher blood pressure, the kidneys can readjust quickly."
8365,肾脏这种器官是你的血管系统的终极调节器。,These organs are the ultimate fine tuners of your vascular system.
8366,血管性昏厥(vascular syncope)也是已知的血管失张力性昏厥和站立性昏厥。,Vascular syncope is also known as vaso­depressor syncope or orthostatic syncope.
8366,该昏厥的机制是站立时从身体下部回流到左心室的血液突然减少引起的。,The mechanism for this reaction begins with reduced left ventricular filling secondary to pooling of blood in the lower parts of the body during standing.
8366,左心室容量下降的结果是位于左心室的特殊感受器受到刺激，引起反射性心率减缓和血管扩张（特别是大脑血管的扩张）。,This reduction in left ventricular volume results in the stimulation of the special receptors that are located in the left ventricle that cause a reflex slowing of the heart rate and vasodilation of the blood vessels (especially in the brain).
8367,高血压、高血糖、吸烟等因素都有可能令动脉血管的光滑内壁出现破裂口。,"High blood pressure, high blood sugar, the effects of cigarettes, and other factors can nick the smooth inner layer of your arteries."
8367,为修复这种破裂口，人体会用胆固醇作为填充物。,Your body tries to repair that nick using cholesterol as a plaster.
8367,但是，如果携带胆固醇的蛋白质是“有害”蛋内质（低密度脂蛋白，LDL)，就会引起发炎，即向白细胞发出信号，要它们迅速保护该部位，结果形成的血小板会促进血栓生成。,"But if the proteins carrying the cholesterol are bad (LDL), an inflammatory reaction is triggered that signals for white cells to invade the area.The resulting plaque becomes irritated and ruptures, which encourages a blood dot to form."
8367,这种血栓会突发性地堵住整条动脉，导致心脏病、中风、性功能障碍和失忆。,"That clot can suddenly block the entire artery—and lead to heart attack, stroke, impotence, and memory loss."
8368,如前所述，将反式饱和脂肪（一种诱发衰老的人工脂肪）和饱和脂肪的摄入限制在20克以下。,"As mentioned above, limit your saturated and trans fats (a mostly artificial form of aging fat) to less than 20 grams a day."
8368,与其他食物构成要素相比，这类脂肪与动脉老化的关系更大，它们多含于肉类、全脂乳制品、烘烤食品、油炸快餐食品、棕榈油和椰油。,"No food element has been more closely linked to arterial aging than these kinds of fats, found mostly in meats, luncheon meats, full-fat dairy products, baked goods, fried fast foods, and palm and coconut oils."
8368,它们会增加动脉发炎的可能，促使血小板淤积，还会后动提高血液中LDL含量的机制一一这种情况也会让血小板涌入动脉。,"They increase arterial inflammation, which promotes plaque buildup, and they also turn on the mechanism that increases LDL cholesterol in the bloodstream, yet another way to slap more plaque onto your arteries."
8369,这个方案 的周跑量并没有达到160千米，塞巴斯蒂安的周跑量仅仅为80千米。,"There were no 100-mile training weeks; rather, Seb’s training rarely exceeded 50 miles per week."
8369,这一方案重点针对速度耐力训练—— 快速跑和快速间歇训练。,It focused on speed-endurance training—fast runs and fast interval training.
8369,还包括了健身房中的循环训练，内容有立卧撑跳、肌肉增强训练和负重训练。,"It also included circuit training in the gym, including burpees, plyometrics, and weight training."
8370,使用利迪亚训练计划的跑者至少要花费8周的时间——通常是比这更多的时间——来建立自己的有氧代谢基地。,Lydiard’s runners spent at least 8 weeks—often more—building an aerobic base.
8370,建立这一基地的关键手段是进行标准跑步训练。,The essential tool for building this base was the standardtraining run.
8370,虽然很多训练计划简称这种训练为长距离慢跑，但利迪亚德指出这并不是简单的慢跑训练，而是快节奏力量跑步训练。,"Although many training plans refer to this workout by the acronym “LSD” (for long, slow distance), Lydiard did not intend these to be easy jogs; he intended them to be up-tempo strength runs."
8370,无论你是一名800米跑步者或者长距离跑运动员，在这个8周训练计划中，你的周跑量至少要达到160千米，期间每周进行一次32千米或以上的长距离慢跑训练。,"But whether you were an 800-meter runner or a long-distance athlete, you ran at least 100 miles per week during this 8-week period, punctuated by a weekly long run of 20 miles or more."
8371,可惜，现代人根本不理解这些，刚开始练，他们就想挑战极限。,"Unfortunately, modern athletes don’t understand this approach at all.When people start training, they normally throw themselves in at the deep end."
8371,这部分地是当今文化的问题：我们生活在“现在就要”的社会里，今天的孩子并不把耐心当作美德——大人也一样。,This is partly for cultural reasons.We live in “want it now” society; kids today don’t see patience as a virtue.Nor do adults.
8371,类固醇是现代人想要迅速见到效果的另一个例证。,Steroids are another reason why modern people expect to see results tomorrow.
8371,类固醇的确带来了“速效”（哪怕是暂时的、不健康的），而逐渐培养训练势头的古老技艺几近失传。,"Steroids bring such fast—albeit temporary and unhealthy—results, that the older art of gradually building training momentum has largely been lost or forgotten."
8372,为什么要如此缓慢、保守呢？,There is a damn good reason why you should proceed slowly and methodically through any training program.
8372,这有个极好的理由，就是“训练势头”。,The reason has to do with generating training momentum.
8372,简单地说，这意味着如果你在训练中更慢地向前推进，你实际上会比急于求成者更快达到目标。,"Basically put, this means that if you build a head of steam by moving forwards more slowly, you’ll actually reach your goals much faster than if you proceeded with haste."
8372,听着像悖论，但这就是事实。,"This sounds like a paradox, but it’s true."
8373,每天都应使用牙线，它能消除牙齿缝隙间500种以上的细菌滋生，有助于减少与牙龈问题有关的炎症发生。,FLOSS Do it every day.It breaks up the more than five hundred kinds of bacteria that live in plaque between your teeth and helps reduce the inflammation associated with gum disease.
8373,（请注意，隔了较长时间后再次使用牙线，牙龈流血是正常现象，但如果一周后每次剔牙后仍然流血，就很可能说明患有某种程度的牙龈炎。）,"(One note: It's normal to bleed when you floss after a long layoff, but if you still bleed following each floss after a week, it's probably a sign you have some level of gingivitis.)"
8374,牙龈疾病与许多健康问题相关，引起牙周疾病的病菌同样也会引发人体免疫系统的反应，造成动脉血管发炎硬化。,"Gum disease (gingivitis) has been linked to many other health problems, presumably because the same bacteria that cause periodontal disease can also trigger an immune response that causes inflammation and hardening of the arteries."
8374,牙齿上的病菌、唾液以及在口腔里待了三天的花椰菜残渣都有可能导致牙齿病。,"That same plaque that causes tooth decay that sticky coating of bacteria, saliva, and three-day-old cauliflower—can also contribute to the plaque in your arteries."
8374,"细菌也会让动脉感染,还可能带来各种心血管问题，从心脏病到勃起功能障碍。","And that has a profound effect on all kinds of vascular problems, from heart attacks to erectile dysfunction."
8375,一个好的研究整合会导出几个确切的结论，且应该会激发对未来研究方向的兴趣。,A good research synthesis results in several tangible conclusions and should spark interest in future directions for research.
8375,有时候，一个研究整合会引导出一个理论的修正或形成。,"Sometimes, a research synthesis leads to a revision to or the proposal of a theory."
8375,重点是，研究整合并不只是个相关文献的摘要，而是个逻辑形式的研究且能引导出有效的结论、假设的评估，以及理论的修正与提出。,"The point is that a research synthesis is not simply a summary of the related literature; it is a logical type of research that leads to valid conclusions, hypothesis evaluations, and the revision and proposal of theory."
8376,从健康长寿的观点看，性对人类生活无比重要。因此我们不应该羞于谈论情欲亢进、射精和性无能这些事情。,"Since sex is such an important part of our lives from a health and longevity standpoint, we shouldn't be embarrassed to talk about things like orgasm, ejaculation, and impotence."
8376,曰前，我们有了一些进步。,"Recently, we have made some strides."
8376,例如，几位伟哥形象代言人说他们不是为了钱才代言，而是得有人敢于讨论勃起功能障碍的问题。,For example，several spokesmen for Viagra said that they did it not for the money but because somebody had to come forward to talk about the problem of erectile dysfunction.
8377,关注一下氧化过程是如何发生也是十分重要的。,It's also important to note how the oxidation process occurs.
8377,在许多方面，氧化是你体内一种良性的、自然发生的过程。你的身体需要氧化使你的免疫系统工作起来，共让你的身体能保护自身。,"In many ways, ox-idation is a good, naturally occurring process in your body* Your body needs oxidation for your immune system to work, for your body to protect itself."
8378,参与者样本可能是从较大的群体或母群体中随机选择出来的。,"The sample of participants might be randomly selected from some larger group, or a population."
8378,举例来说，如果你所在的学院或大学有10000位学生，你可以随机地选取200位来进行研究。,"For example, if your college or university has 10,000 students, you could randomly select 200 for a study."
8378,你指派给这10000位学生每个人一个数字编号，第一个数字编号是0000，第二位是0001、第三位是0002，直到最后一位（第10000位）的编号是9999。接着使用随机表来选择样本。,"You would assign each of the 10,000 students a numeric ID.The first numeric ID would be 0000, the second 0001, the third 0002, up through the last (the 10,000th), who would be 9999.Then a random numbers table would be used to select the sample."
8379,有许多研究者认为金丝桃（又名“贯叶连翘”）能够治疗抑郁症，但是它会对其他药物产生影响，比如，它加速了避孕药物中相关成分的代谢。,"While many studies have focused on St. John's wort as an antidepressant, it has interactions with many other medications."
8379,同时服用麦芽计和避孕药的人，有25%会遇到避孕药失效的情况。SAMe治疗轻度抑郁，与麦芽计一样有效，而且还不会干优其他药物。,"For example, it increases the metabolism of substances in birth control pills, essentially making them useless for 25 percent of the people who take both birth control pills and St. John's wort, SAMe is just as effective for mild depression, without the interactions with other medications."
8380,有许多食物像菠菜、番茄和橙汁都含有叶酸，还有许多食品像面包和谷类食品都补充有叶酸。,"Lots of foods—like spinach, tomatoes, and orange juice—contain folate, and many foods—like bread and cereal—are supplemented with it."
8380,但是从食物中吸收叶酸不如从补充剂中吸收的好。,But folate from food is absorbed less well than folic acid from supplements.
8380,如果你想想，一杯225克的橙汁只有43微克叶酸，那么就得喝大约25杯橙汁才能获取推荐量的叶酸。,"When you consider that an eight-ounce glass of orange juice has only 43 micrograms of folate, that would mean you'd have to drink about twenty-five eight-ounce glasses of OJ a day to get the recommended amount."
8381,但好处何在？除了在地铁上惹人注目外，深呼吸会带给我们什么益处呢？,"What will deep breathing get you, besides stares on the subway?"
8381,事实上益处 有很多。,"A lot, actually."
8381,首先，它有利于将一氧化氮输送到肺部。一氧化氮存留在鼻腔，是一种非常重要的肺部和血管扩张剂，因此它保证了肺和血管更好地运作。,"For one, it helps transport nitric oxide—a very potent lung and blood vessel dilator that resides in your nasal passages—to your lungs.So it makes your lungs and blood vessels function better."
8382,胰腺，肝脏的后邻居，主要是因为它在生产胰岛素中的作用而受到关注。,"The pancreas, the liver's backyard neighbor, gets attention primarily for its role in producing insulin."
8382,但事实并非如此。,But thats not all it does.
8382,看起来像一条带鱼头的牛排，胰腺大约有六英寸长。,"Looking like a strip steak with a fish head, the pancreas is about six inches long."
8383,就女性而言，最重要的内部结构是子宮颈——向下开口，与阴道相通的子宫的颈部。,"On the female side, one of the most important internal structures to think about is the cervix——the neck of the uterus that opens downward to the vagina."
8383,宫颈在怀孕中发挥着重要作用。人体伸长宮颈让胚胎留在子宮里，然后宫颈缩短扩张，便于分娩生产。,The cervix plays an important role in pregnancy; it lenghtens to hold the fetus in the uterus and then shortens and dilates to allow labor and delivery.
8384,人类一直喜欢把引体向上当作强壮的特征，这不是什么新鲜事。,Human beings have always been attracted to pullups as a feat of strength.It’s nothing new.
8384,其实，引体向上是现存最古老的肌肉练习动作。,"In fact, the pullup is the oldest muscle-building exercise in existence."
8384,我们很容易就能找到前人练习引体向上的证据。有几位古典作家曾描述过这个动作，它在战士、运动员以及想获得上好体力的平民中很流行。,"Evidence of pullups in ancient history are easy to find; several classical writers described the technique, which was popular with warriors, athletes, and even civilians who wanted to retain excellent levels of strength."
8384,尽管如此，我们也无法确定引体向上的起源，因为从某种意义上说，引体向上可能比我们人类出现的时间还要早。,"Despite this, it’s impossible to date the origin of the exercise, because in a sense it undoubtedly predates the human species."
8385,印度深蹲有缺点也有优点。,There are good and bad pints about Hindu squats.
8385,缺点是，它不能取代普通深蹲系列，因为它只能通过增加次数来增加难度，这样做可以增强耐力，但不能增强力量。,"On the down side, Hindu squats are no replacement for the regular squat series, because the only way you can make them progressive is by adding reps. This develops stamina, but not strength."
8385,此外，动作过程中的惯性也可能导致健身者膝盖发炎。,"In addition, the momentum used during the natural rhythm may irritate the knees of some athletes."
8385,优点是，它的节奏感和高次数很适合想增强下半身的耐力但又找不到地方跑步的人。,"On the plus side, the rhythmic nature of Hindu squats make them an excellent choice for a high rep alternative to running for those who wish to develop lower body endurance but with little floor space."
8385,另外，印度深蹲对心肺能力也大有裨益。,They also provide great cardio benefits.
8385,如果你准备练习印度深蹲，那么就要将其逐渐纳入你的训练计划，给膝关节时间来适应这项练习。,"If you chose to use them, work them into your program gradually, to allow your knee tendons to get used to the exercise."
8386,复杂技能的起源时间可以追溯到儿童 早期基本技能出现之时，如握、走、抓、投，等等。,"The origin of complex skills can be traced back to early childhood as fundamental skills develop, such as grasping, walking, catching, throwing, and so on."
8386,本章主要介绍出生时的运动技能和婴儿期运动技能的发展，然后分析儿童期运动技能是如何随着实践和训练而发展的。,"This chapter briefly describes the state of the motor repertoire at birth and its development during infancy, then analyses how skills develop with practiceor training during childhood."
8386,最后，简要回顾解释技能获取过程的不同理论观点。,"Finally, a brief review is given of the different theoretical points of view accounting for processes underlying skill acquisition."
8387,运动员，特别是优秀运动员仅仅是普通人群中的一小部分。,"Athletes, and especially elite athletes, represent a very small percentage of the general population."
8387,他们在相当小的年龄，通常已经表现出明显的形态学方面和运动能力方面的某些特征。,"Quite often they show , already at a rather young age, distinct morphological and performance characteristics."
8387,因而，应先对普通人群在成熟期运动能力的变化加以考察，而后再讨论与运动员的相关变化。,It is thus reasonable to review maturity-associated variation inperformance in the general population and then to discuss the associations in athletes.
8388,在10个月 后，他们不仅已经能够完成需要两个步骤的动作而且能够完成需要更困难的双手协调的有目的的手段行为。,"After 10 months of age, they can succeed at means—ends behaviour requiring not only successive two-step actions, but more difficult spatiotem poral coordination between the two hands."
8388,"例如，他们一边拿着盒盖一边取出盒内的玩具（Bruner et al., 1969; Ramsay & Weber, 1986; Fagard, 1994)，可以将物体拿住并找准方 向从中取出东西（Flament, 1975; Fagard & Jacquet, 1989;见 Fagard, 1994 的综述）。","For instance they can hold the lid of a box open while reaching inside for a toy (Bruneret al., 1969; R am say & Weber, 1986; Fagard, 1994), hold and orient an object to pick up something from inside (Flam ent, 1975; Fagard & Jacquet, 1989; see Fagard, 1994 for a review )."
8388,由于他们在童年时学到很多技能，这类双手互补的协调能力成为多数技能的 基础，逐渐形成儿童的全部技能。,"This kind of complementary bimanual coordination forms the basis of most skills which will gradually form the repertoire of the child, as he or she learns many new skills during childhood."
8389,如果在没有训练的受试者中测试功率峰值，我们建议采用困难较低的力-速度试验。,"If the aim is to measure peak power in untrained subjects, we recommended the less stressful force-velocity test."
8389,此外，由于测试时间短，力-速度试验可以取得较高的功率峰值。,"Moreover, the force-velocity test yields higher peak power output because of the shortness of the test."
8389,温盖特试验反映腿（臂）肌肉耐力更为精确，可以用于疲劳的研究。,The Wingate test reflects leg (or arm) muscle endurance more accurately and is relevant for fatigue studies.
8389,需要对儿童力-速度试验的有效性和可靠性进一步开展研究,"In children, the force-velocity test needs further validity and reliability studies."
8390,布莱恩•麦肯齐早就摆脱了跑者对饮食需求的老套观念。,Brian MacKenzie long ago shed the stereotypical runner’s view of food.
8390,在一次早期的采访中，我们在他位于加州科斯塔梅萨的家中和他见面。,"For an early interview with him, we met at his house in Costa Mesa, California."
8390,他的厨房有一种实验室的气氛，冰箱里储存的是草饲牛肉和金属罐装的鱼油。,The kitchen had a laboratory vibe to it.He had a freezer stocked with grass-fed beef and metallic bottles of fish oil.
8391,当效标是较晚发生的行为时，例如以入学测验来预测就学后的表现，那么预测效度(predictive validity) 才是应该重视的效度。,"When the criterion is some later behavior, such as entrance examinations used to predict later success, predictive validity is the major concern."
8391,假设有一个体育课老师想发展一份在初级体操课的测验，用来预测学生在进阶体操课的表现。,Suppose a physical education instructor wished to develop a test that could be given in beginning gymnastics classes to predict success in advanced classes.
8391,学生在初级课程时接受这份测验，然后在进阶课程结束时计算此测验结果与进阶课程表现(成绩或是评等之类的分数)的相关。,"Students would take this test while they were in the beginner course.At the end of the advanced course, those test results would be correlated with the criterion of success (grades, ratings, and so on)."
8391,如果想预测某个特定的行为，研究者必须确认此行为是否具有一个已知的基准率。,"In trying to predict a certain behavior, a researcher should try to ascertain whether there is a known base rate for that behavior."
8392,在月经初潮时，乳房的发育十分明显。,At menarche there is a considerable range of breast development.
8392,大多数女孩的乳房处于发育阶段IV (乳头和乳晕高出整个乳房，表21.2)。,"Most girls are in breast stage IV (projection of the nipple and areola above the level of the rest of the breast, see Table 2 1.2 )."
8392,但是，约25%的女孩的乳房处于发育的阶段III，少部分处于阶段II。同样，在月经初或IV，但有些处于阶段V，极少数刚刚出现阴毛（阶段I)。,"However, some 25% are in breast stage III, with a small percentage in stage II.Similarly, most girls at menarche are in pubic hair stages III or IV, but some are in stage V, and a very few have yet to have pubarche (stage I)."
8393,支配昼夜节律的时钟并没有特别注意运动员的比赛。,The clocks that dictate circadian rhythms have no particular regard for athletic competition.
8393,但是它们确实改变了可影响运动表现的生理功能。,But they do govern phasic changes in physiological functions that have important bearing on motor performance.
8393,肌肉力量、体温调节机制、心输出量，甚至是动机都自然地、可预测地在一天中发生改变。,"Muscle strength, thermoregulatory mechanisms, cardiac output, even motivation all naturally and predictably change throughout the course of a day."
8393,因此，一天中运动员训练或者比赛的时间点极其重要。,"So, the time of day when athletes train or compete may be critically important."
8394,青年运动员的训练安排主要将重点放在提高具体运动项目的运动技能上，如投掷、跳跃、踢球。,"Youth athletic programs place a major emphasis on improving motor skills that are more specific to sports, such as throwing, jumping, and ball kicking."
8394,但是，令人吃惊的是，儿童运动能力可塑性的研究数量非常有限。,"Given this focus, it is rather surprising that a very limited amount of research exists on the trainability of such abilities in children."
8394,同样，专项的训练技术是否会比其他更有效也缺乏数据支持。,Equally lacking are data to indicate whether particular instructional techniques are more effective than others.
8394,此外，我们对环境的制约、同伴的影响以及家长的塑造等变量的影响知之甚少。,"And we know little about the influence of variables such as environmental constraints, peer influence, and parent modeling."
8394,但是，从有限的已经完成的调查中我们发现，似乎为获得早期运动技能而安排的指导和练习，对于提髙儿童早期（3〜7岁）的运动表现是有益的。,"But from the few investigations that have been done, it does seem that instruction and practice on early acquisition of motor skills is beneficial in improving motor performances in early childhood years (ages 3 to 7)."
8395,"但是，最后的发育成熟和超凡的运动能力并不依赖儿童多快进人青春期，在任何情况下，食品补剂都不能促进这个过程 (Smith & Worthington-Roberts, 1989) 。","However, eventual maturity and athletic prowess does not necessarily depend upon how early a child reaches adolescence, and in any event, the process will not be facilitated by dietary supplements (Smith & Worthington- Roberts, 1989)."
8395,“好的东西，多多益善”的格言并不适用于食品补剂。,
8395,,The adage of 'if some is good then more must be better' does not apply to supplements.
8395,恰恰相反，如果摄取过多，某些维生素和矿物质还可能成为有毒物质。,"On the contrary, if taken in large doses, certain vitamins and minerals can be toxic."
8396,用日历年龄作为评价个体发育状态的指标有一定的局限性。,Chronological age (CA) has limited utility as an indicator of individual maturity status.
8396,在同一日历年龄的个体中，特别是处于青春期间的个体，身体特征存在着很大的变异。,"There is considerable variability in physical characteristics among individuals of the same CA, especially during the pubertal years."
8396,生长过程和生物学上的成熟过 程是相互关联的，二者均会影响到身体的运动能力。,"The processes of growth and biological matu­ ration are related, and both influence physical performance."
8397,运动员，特别是优秀运动员仅仅是普通人群中的一小部分。,"Athletes, and especially élite athletes, represent a very small percentage of the general population."
8397,他们在相当小的年龄，通常已经表现出明显的形态学方面和运动能力方面的某些特征。,"Quite often they show, already at a rather young age, distinct morphological and performance characteristics."
8397,因而，应先对普通人群在成熟期运动能力的变化加以考察，而后再讨论与运动员的相关变化。,It is thus reasonable to review maturity-associated variation in performance in the general population and then to discuss the associations in athletes.
8398,在所有的引体向上动作中，短板都是手臂上的屈肌，即肱二头肌与相关的前臂肌肉。,The weakest link in all pullup movements are the arm flexors—the biceps and related upper arm/forearm muscles.
8398,如果训练者已经掌握了双臂引体向上，想升级到单臂引体向上，那就得花时间极大地强化肱二头肌——这就是窄距引体向上的用意所在。,"If an athlete has mastered two-arm pullups and wishes to progress to the single arm version, he will have to spend time radically strengthening his biceps."
8398,两手紧挨在一起时，更大、更强的背部肌肉不容易发力，这样就迫使手臂上的屈肌承担更大的负荷，从而让它们（尤其是肱二头肌）变得更大、更有力。,"This is what close pullups do—bringing the hands nearer together puts the bigger, stronger back muscles at a disadvantage and forces more of the load on the arm flexors.Close pullups will force your biceps to grow larger and more powerful."
8399,骨的生长是在内分泌系统的控制下按照遗传程序发生的整个骨架的变大过程。,Growth is the expression of the genetically programmed process of enlargement of the entireskeleton under the control of the endocrinesystem.
8399,生长时，不会发生有选择性的某些骨骼的增大或某一个骨骼的特殊区域的增粗。,There is no selective enlargement ofindividual bones or specific regions within asingle bone.
8399,生长涉及到了整个的骨架，随着长骨骨骺的愈合纵向的生长就终止了。,Growth involves the entire skeleton and longitudinal growth ceases with the closure of the epiphyses of the long bones.
8400,因为在体育环境中倾向于过分强调一般参照标准，所以我们极力推荐根据掌握经验来定义每个儿童的最佳挑战。最佳挑战是指有 一定困难但经过努力可以达到的目标，这些目标是依据个人最近的技能水平制定的，并可以不断改进。,"Because norm-referenced sources tend to be overemphasized in the sport environment, it is strongly recommended that mastery experiences be defined as optimal challenges for each child, which are difficult, but attainable, goals that are customized to the individual's current skill capabilities and opportunities for improvement."
8400,用这种方法，可以激发儿童去取得个人化的成就，达到个人的成功标准。,"In this way, children are motivated to achieve individualized and realistic personal standards of success."
8401,东方医学把针灸的疗效归功于对气流的导引，而西医也在寻找针灸有效的原因。,"While Eastern medicine attributes the success to the redirection of energy flow, Western medicine is also looking for reasons why acupuncture might be effective."
8401,下面一些理论也许可以解释：针灸可以刺激身体，释放影响神经系统的化学物质内啡肽，而内啡肽能起到缓解疼痛作用。甚至还有研究总结出这样的结论：针灸能促进血液循环，有利于康复进展。,"Some possible theories: Acupuncture releases neurochemicals—endorphins—that relieve pain, and researchers have even theorized that it increases circulation to help the healing process."
8402,对人施测取得的测验分数称为观察分数。,A test score obtained by a person is the observed score.
8402,此分数不确定是否为此人能力或表现的真实评价。,It is not known whether this is a true assessment of this person’s ability or performance.
8402,测量误差可能会因测验指示、测量工具、评分、或是受测者情绪或生理状态而发生。,"Measurement error may occur because of the test directions, the instrumentation, the scoring, or the person’s emotional or physical state."
8402,因此，观察分数理论上是由受测者的真实分数以及误差分数组成。,"Thus, an observed score theoretically consists of the person’s true score and error score."
8402,以分数的变异量来表示时，观察分数的变异数等于真实分数的变异量加上误差分数的变异量。,"Expressed in terms of score variance, the observed score variance consists of true score variance plus error variance."
8403,本节讨论的设计称为真实验设计（true experimentaldesigns)，因为组别是随机形成的，接受研究起始时是相等的假设。,"The designs discussed in this section are called true experimental designs because the groups are randomly formed, allowing the assumption that they were equivalent at the beginning of the research."
8403,如此一来，控制了过去（不是现在）的历史、成熟（各组发生的情形均等)、测验，以及所有基于组间不等而来的无效度来源（统计回归、选择偏误及选择与成熟的交互作用）。,"This controls for past (but not present) history, maturation (which should occur equally in the groups), testing, and all sources of invalidity that are based on nonequivalence of groups (statistical regression, selection biases, and selection-maturation interaction)."
8403,但只有实验者能确定没有在一组（除了实验处理之外）和另一组（目前资料）发生任何事情，依变项分数不会因为仪器问题而变动分数，组别之间也没有研究对象流失的差异（实验流失率）。,"But only the experimenter can make sure that nothing happens to one group (besides the treatment) and not the other (present history), that scores on the dependent measure do not vary as a result of instrumentation problems, and that the loss of participants is not different between the groups (experimental mortality)."
8404,CPG脊髓部分的发射频率，是由更高级的大脑中枢决定的（正如当你害怕时，交感神经系统会加快心脏窦房结的自动发射频率）。,"In the portion of the CPG in the spinal cord, the rate of firing is dictated by higher brain centers (much as the sympathetic nervous system speeds up the spontaneously firing of the sinus node of the heart when you’re frightened)."
8404,究竟是什么决定了这些振荡器神经元的最大发射速度，我们不得而知。但可以确定的是，在电解质移动穿过细胞膜的速率（内在控制）以及影响振荡器发射频率的大脑控制器指令（外在控制）方面，均存在一个物理化学意义上的上限。,"What determines the maximal firing speed of these pacemaker neurons is not known, but obviously there must exist upper physical-chemical limits to rates of electrolyte movement across membranes (intrinsic control) and the commands of brain governors that influence pacemaker firing rate (extrinsic control)."
8405,感觉运动系统的信息处理过程和集成过程中的变化在技能获取的各个阶段是特别有关系的。,Change in information processing and integration of the sensorimotor system are particularly relevant during stages of skill acquisition.
8405,技能的熟练程度的识别标志就是参与动作的身体各部分之间以及各动作成分之间在时空上的顺畅平滑程度。,The signature of skillfulness is the smoothness in the spatiotemporal relationship between segments involved as well as between component actions.
8405,在技能获取的后期，虽然对意外环境变化 的反应是很快的，但是少量的外周反馈对于动作还是必需的。,"At a late stage of acquisition, little peripheral feedback is necessary for action, although unexpected changes in environment are quickly responded to."
8406,"测量两个变项之间关联程度的一种方法是皮尔森积差相关系数(Pearson product moment coefficient of correlation)(也称为 Pearson r,组间相关，或是简单相关)。","One measure of the degree of association between two variables is called the Pearson product moment coefficient of correlation (also known as Pearson r, interclass correlation, or simple correlation)."
8406,当两个变项之间没有关联存在时，它们的相关趋近于零。,"When two variables are unrelated, their correlation is approximately zero."
8406,"在图6.1中,两个变项(身高和立定跳远成绩)具有中等程度的正相关(r值大约介于40到60之间)。",In figure 6.1 the two variables (height and standing-long-jump scores) have a moderately positive correlation (r is probably between 40 and 60).
8407,支撑深蹲是半深蹲之前的最后一式。,Supported squats are the last exercise before the athlete progresses onto half squats.
8407,它是折刀深蹲（双腿承受大部分身体重量）与半深蹲（双腿承受全部身体重量）之间理想的过渡动作。,This exercise forms an ideal link between the jackknife squat (where the legs move the majority of the body’s weight) and the half squat (where the legs move virtually all the weight of the body).
8407,支撑深蹲能够进一步加强下肢的柔韧性和力量，锻炼膝盖的肌腿、韧带及软组织。,"Supported squats continue adding flexibility and strength to the athlete’s lower limbs.They condition the tendons, ligaments and soft tissues of the knees."
8407,它能让你的深蹲动作更标准，锻炼你仅仅使用肌肉力量而非惯性从最低点推起身体的能力。,"They are a good way to continue perfecting form, most importantly the ability to push up from the bottom position using strength alone rather than momentum."
8408,但是，近来汉德贝里等（Handberg et al.，1992)的研究表明，骨骼肌的GLUT4总量，在健康人接近生理胰岛素浓度水平时，不是一个好的指标。,"However, recently, Handberg et al. (1992) showed that the total content of skeletal muscle GLUT 4 is a poor predictor for in vivo response to near physiological insulin concentrations in healthy human subjects."
8408,此外，在1型糖尿病骨骼肌GLUT4的水平不变，并且与重要生理因子无关。,"Additionally, in type I diabetics, GLUT 4 levels are unaltered in skeletal muscle and do not correlate with important physiological factors."
8408,"所以，在人类糖尿病中，存在着葡萄糖载体的组织特异性调节，并且载体表达的变化不能解释机体内的胰岛素抵抗糖摄取的问题（Kahn,1992)。","So, in human diabetes, there is tissue-specific regulation of glucose transporters and changes in transporter expression do not explain in vivo insulinresistant glucose uptake (Kahn, 1992)."
8408,目前尚无有关儿童和青少年糖尿病患者GLUT4的资料。,There are no data on GLUT 4 in diabetic children and adolescents.
8409,莱文（1981)采用Meili测试量表，构建出田径儿童运动员的智力特征剖面图。,"Using the Meili's intelligence test, Levin (1981) constructed intelligence profiles of children involved in track-and-field activity."
8409,有145名年龄在11~12岁报名参加田径班的儿童参加了这次测试。,"The test was administered to 145 children 11 —12 years old, candidates for sport classes specializing in track-and-field events."
8409,研究对以下两组儿童的智力剖面图进行了比较：（1) 75名已经在该班一年并表现优秀的儿童； (2) 70名不能赶上课程进度的儿童。,"Comparison was carried out between the intelligence profiles of the 75 children involved in these classes, and 1 year successfully participated in them and the 70 children who appeared as not able enough to get on with track-and-field events."
8410,在大多数情况，你会感兴趣的是一组分数的平均数。,"Most often, you are interested in the mean of a group of scores."
8410,你可能偶尔也会注意到中位数，或者是另一种集中趋势的测量一众数（mode) ，它是指一个数列中最常出现的一个数字。,"You may occasionally be interested in the median or perhaps in another measure of central tendency, the mode, which is defined as the most frequently occurring score."
8410,在前面的例子中，众数也是5 ，因为它出现了 3 次。,"In the previous example, the mode is also 5, because it occurs three times."
8410,有些分数的群组可能有超过一个众数。,Some groups of scores may have more than one mode.
8411,如果这是1890年，毫无疑问有一个人会站出来强烈支持中央控制器假说。,"If this were 1890, one person, without doubt, would have stood up and vehemently supported the central governor hypothesis."
8411,事实上，是Sigmund Freud (西格蒙德•弗洛伊德）本人让世人认识到，是众多的确定性心理活动搅乱了我们的大脑潜意识水平。,"Indeed, it was Sigmund Freud himself who opened the world’s vision to the hubbub of deterministic mental activity that churned in our brains beneath the conscious level."
8411,他的观点产生了一种全新的方式，即将意识行为看作是压抑的、潜意识过程的最终表达。,"His ideas, of course, generated a whole new way of looking at conscious behavior as an expression of repressed, subconscious processes."
8412,吸引人的部分在于，如果你只是要求受试者以他们擅长的速度跑步，这个速度通常也就是最经济的速度。,"The fascinating part of this is that now, if you simply ask the subjects to run at a speed that they prefer, it almost always nearly coincides with that most economical velocity."
8412,中央运动振荡器具有敏锐的洞察力。,That central motor oscillator has keen insight.
8412,它知道什么样的速度将 花费跑步者最少的代谢工作，甚至没有与他们协商就能做出相应的指示。,"It knows what speed will cost runners the least metabolic work, dictating this without even consulting them."
8413,在大多数情况，你会感兴趣的是一组分数的平均数。,"Most often, you are interested in the mean of a group of scores."
8413,你可能偶尔也会注意到中位数，或者是另一种集中趋势的测量——众数（mode) ，它是指一个数列中最常出现的一个数字。,"You may occasionally be interested in the median or perhaps in another measure of central tendency, the mode, which is defined as the most frequently occurring score."
8413,在前面的例子中，众数也是5，因为它出现了3次。,"In the previous example, the mode is also 5, because it occurs three times."
8413,有些分数的群组可能有超过一个的众数。,Some groups of scores may have more than one mode.
8414,在重测法（test-retestmethod)中，测验在当日施行后，隔天或是稍后几日会再施行一次。,"In the test-retest method, the test is given one day and then repeated a day or so later."
8414,这个间隔长短会因测验的激烈程度，以及是否需要超过一天的休息而调整。,The interval may be governed to some extent by how strenuous the test is and whether more than a day’s rest is needed.
8414,当然，此间隔不能长到在两次测验中已经发生能力、成熟状态、或是学习效果有改变的程度。,"Of course, the interval cannot be so long that actual changes in ability, maturation, or learning occur between the two test administrations."
8415,"第三种姿态——重建，包含了基于补偿和辩解的策略（Coombs, 2007)。","The third type of posture, rebuilding, contains strategies grounded in compensation and apologia (Coombs, 2007)."
8415,除了基本的现金支付之外，补偿通常会以慈善捐款的方式进行。,"In addition to basic cash payments, compensation sometimes takes the form of donations to charity."
8415,这种捐赠作为一种善意的姿态，不仅在个体中产生，也在组织中出现。,"Such donations serve as gestures of goodwill, not just among individuals but also among organizations."
8416,迪査理说，不好的姿势是一切跑步问题的根源。,"But poor posture is responsible for all sorts of running problems, Dicharry says."
8416,例如，不好的姿势会引起重心向后移动，也就造成了跨大步跑步和后脚跟落地的方式，同时也增加了受伤的风险。,"For example, poor posture causes the center of gravity to shift backward, encouraging overstriding and the resulting heel strike and increase in injury risk."
8416,“不好的姿势至少削弱了你50% 调动肌肉的能力，这些肌肉正是稳定脊柱和小腿的来源。”,"“It impairs your ability to activate the muscles that stabilize the spine and the lower legs,” says Dicharry, “by as much as 50 percent.”"
8417,但是，我们必须要考虑更大范畴的生物钟。,"It turns out, though, that even bigger timekeepers must be considered."
8417,事实上，每一个生物体都拥有一个 可控制细胞周期性功能，使之阶段性增加和减少的时钟。,"In fact, every living being possesses clocks that govern phasic increases and decreases in cell function that cycle with chronological time."
8417,由于这种模式通常大约为一 天的时间，因此被称为昼夜节律。circadian rhythms，源自拉丁文circa (大约）和dies (天）。,"Since such patterns usually approximate a day’s duration, they are termed circadian rhythms, from the Latin circa (about) and dies (day)."
8417,在整个动植物王国里，这是很明显的，它表明这些节律是生物体的一个重要 特征。,"They’re evident throughout both the plant and animal kingdoms, indicating that these rhythms are a central feature of living matter."
8417,但是，为什么我们的身体组织工作要按照时钟进行呢（当然，这不像你我，身体从来不看表）？这仍然是一个未解之谜。,"However, why our tissues do their work with an eye on the clock (unlike you or me, of course) remains an unsolved mystery."
8418,循环系统疾病是胸痛最少见的原因。,The most unusual cause of chest pain is the circulatory system.
8418,心血管系统引起的胸痛通常伴有昏厥或昏厥前期、心悸的历史和既往心脏手术史或者家庭成员过早意外死亡的历史（Duster，1990）。,"Chest pain that is the result of the cardiovascular system often is ac­companied by a history of syncope or pre­syncope, palpitations, previous cardiac surgery or perhaps a positive family history of early sudden unexpected death (Duster, 1990)."
8418,如果患马凡氏综合征（Marfan’s syndrome)或特纳氏综合征（Turner’s syndrome)的人突然胸痛，必须怀疑是否是主动脉破裂引起的。,"If chest pain occurs acutely in an individual with Marian's syndrome or Turner's syndrome, acute dissection of the aorta should be suspected."
8419,由特殊细胞（称为起搏细胞）发出的电流，由心脏顶部开始向下流动，刺激心肌，将血液挤出，通过主动脉瓣膜。,Electricity from special cells (called pacemaker cells)—starting at the top of the heart and moving down—stimulates the heart muscle to wring the blood out through the aortic valve.
8419,这就像拧湿毛巾—样，把水扔出来。,
8419,从心脏中流出的血液自动注入主动脉，主动脉是人体最大的动脉血管，将富含氧气的血液输送到人体其他部分。,"The wave of blood that has been twisted out of the heart is ejected into the aorta itself, the body's largest artery, which carries oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body."
8420,这3项比赛是完全不同的比赛，应该具体情况具 体分析。,These are significantly different races and should be approached differently.
8420,短距离的比赛应该跑得更快，而长距离的比赛应该跑得慢些， 以 防 “撞墙”。,"The shorter races should be run faster, and the longer ones should be run slower to avoid bonking."
8420,但是，你仍旧不应该忽略5千米和10千米的训练。,"Still, you shouldn’t ignore your 5K and 10K training."
8420,那么，我为什 么要提到比你备赛距离更短的比赛配速呢？,Why am I talking about your speed in race distances shorter than the race you want to train for?
8420,原因在于，进行针对比赛 距离提高速度的训练后，如5干米和10千米比赛，你将能够在更长距 离的比赛中保持更快的配速，如半程马拉松或更长距离的比赛。,"Because when you work in a way that improves your speed at race distances such as the 5K and 10K, you’re going to be able to sustain a faster pace in long-distance races such as the half-marathon and up."
8421,人类很早就知道，正确利用自身体重训练既可以塑造完美的身材，也可以打造强悍的力量。,It has long been known that the correct practice of bodyweight training both perfects the physique and develops great strength.
8421,在史前时期，当早期人类想增强并展示自己的身体能力时，他们会利用自己对身体的控制力。他们会将身体向上拉起、屈膝跳跃，还会借助手臂的力量把身体推离地面。,"Ever since prehistory, when the first men wished to develop and display their power they did so by demonstrating their control over their body; lifting the body up, bending the knees and jumping, and pressing the body away from the surface of the earth using the strength of the limbs."
8421,这些动作最终演化成了体操的基本动作。,These actions eventually evolved into what we would recognize today as the art of calisthenics.
8422,与成年人相似，少年儿童非常喜欢目标明确的进步，目标台阶设置得越多，效果越好。,"Like adults, children respond very well to goaloriented progressions.The more levels on the ladder of goals, the better."
8422,"青少年应参与康复目标的制定，并使其尽可能具体和专业（Danish, 1984; Murphy，1991)。","A dolescents should take some responsibility for setting the goals, making them as concrete and specific as possible (Danish, 1984; Murphy, 1991)."
8422,若有可能，受伤的青少年应该尽快在短期内达到制定的中期目标。,"If possible, the injured youth should be able to reach intermediate goals at fairly short intervals."
8422,通过变换弹力带的颜色，增加重复锻炼的次数，增加抗阻自由重量均可以表示康复的进步。,"Progress may be indicated by changing colours of elastic bands or tubing, by increasing numbers of repetitions, or by increasing resistance of free weights."
8423,因此，为了区分自尊和其他的自我概念，我们有必要确切地査明自尊的特征。,"Therefore, it is necessary to identify the discerning features of self-esteem that in combination make self-esteem unlike any other self-conception."
8423,自尊最重要的特征包括个体对自身价值的评价。,
8423,,"Most importantly, self-esteem involves an individual’s assessment of his or her own worth (Coopersmith, 1981; Elarter, 1986; Rosenberg, 1986)."
8423,高自尊的个体认为自己很棒，对自己很满意；而低自尊的个体一般缺乏自我尊重，对自己不满意。,"High self-esteem individuals view themselves favourably and are satisfied with themselves, whereas low self-esteem individuals tend to lack self-respect and feel inadequate."
8424,壁厚的子宮比举重运动员的二头肌还大，可以形象地说，子宫这时就会吸住阴茎，最终将精子拉进房间等待与卵子结合。,"The thick-walled uterus, which is actually larger than a weight lifter's bicep, literally sucks on the penis and ultimately pulls the sperm into its chamber for fertilization."
8424,此刻，只要精子一鼓作气冲到终点，就能最先与卵子结合。,
8424,如果结合成功，受精卵会嵌入一处子宫壁，着床生长。,"If one does, the fertilzied egg reaches an area of the uterine wall(womb) where it gets implanted."
8425,该试验被认为是测试跳跃功率的黄金标准，并用来验证其他无氧功率试验的有效性。,The test is considered as the gold standard in jump power testing and has been used for validation of other anaerobic power tests.
8425,在测力台上进行纵跳时记录的功率输出峰值与在等动功率车上测得的峰值高度相关（r=0.95)。,Peak power output recorded during a vertical jump on a force platform is highly correlated with that measured on an isokinetic cycle ergometer (r=o.95).
8425,但是，对不同方式活动之间的功率输出在机械上从来不会是精确无比的。,"However, the comparison of power outputs between different forms of activities can never be mechanically exact."
8426,"如果研究对象是银发族群,有的可能甚至在研究期间就往生了。","In longitudinal studies of senior citizens, some may die over the course of the study."
8426,"因此 ,这个问题是出在当受试者流失的状况发生时,研究者无法知道替换样本是否与原来样本的特性一致。",The problem is not knowing whether the sample characteristics remain the same when participants are lost.
8426,"举例来说,当有些儿童因为父母亲的工作改变而必须随之搬迁,有无可能是因这些儿童的父母亲是属于较富裕家庭的社经地位而迁移至别处,而留下来的儿童样本是否渐渐地变成是由一群较低社经地位的家庭来组成呢?","For example, when children are lost from the sample because parents change jobs, is the sample then composed of children of lower socioeconomic levels because the more affluent parents moved?"
8427,"因此，如果知道一位老师（如：布鲁克女士）每个月的薪水为1，750美金 ，便能够轻易地在图上标示出1，750美金在水平（X）轴（横坐标）的位置和 垂 直（y）轴（纵坐标）上 21,000美金的位置相交。","Thus, if we know that a teacher (e.g., Ms. Brooks) earns a monthly salary of $1,750, we can easily plot this on the graph where $1,750 on the，horizontal(x) axis (the  abscissa)  intercepts the vertical"
8427,预测方程式（Y ，年收入预测）为t 二12X。,"(y) axis (the ordinate)  at $21,000.The equation for prediction (T, predicted annual income) is thus Y = 12X."
8427,"在此例子中，将老师的月薪（X）置入公式中：Y-12（1,750）= 21,000。","In this example, the teacher’s monthly salary (X) is inserted in the formula: Y = 12(1,750) = 21,000."
8428,因为应力相对集中，解剖学异常的个体容易发生过度使用损伤。,Individuals with anatomical abnormalities may be predisposed to overuse injuries because stress may concentrate at certain anatomical locations.
8428,例如，髌股应力综合症常见于股骨过度前倾的青少年跑步运动员。,"For example, patellofemoral stress syndrome is frequently seen in young runners who have excessive femoral anteversion."
8428,髋关节过度内旋会导致步态的支撑中期足过度旋前，出现膝关节Q角增大，加大了髌骨关节面的负荷。,Excessive internal rotation of the hip produces  foot overpronation at the midstance stage in the gait cycle.This results in an increase in the functional Q angle at the knee which is believed to produce an increase in the load placed on the patellofem oral joint.
8428,股骨的前倾，膝关节内翻，外翻，胫骨外旋增加及前足过度旋前都是引起膝关节疼痛及损伤的原因。,"Excessive femoral anteversion, genu varum or valgum, increased external tibial rotation, and excessive forefoot pronation can also be contributing factors to knee pain and injury."
8429,当霍克的形象被描述并与细井作比较时，他的种族并没有被刻意提及。,"When Hawk's body was described and compared to Hosoi's, his ethnicity was not explicitly marked."
8429,"相反地，纪录片对霍克的描述就是个子高挑，更多的是“机器人” 或是“比赛机器”；对细井则是通常描述其能够加强他优雅风格的紧凑身形：“娇小的个子，拥有强壮的大腿、胸部和上臂——克里斯蒂安能够成为一个很好的（棒球）游击手或是英式足球前卫队员，而他出色的平衡感可以让他拔下天线，令其他滑板选手望洋兴叹。”(Greenfeld, 2004, p.70)","Instead, Hawk was described throughout the documentary as tall and lanky, more ""robotic"" and a ""contest machine.""Whereas Hosoi was consistently described as having a more compact body that enhanced his graceful style: ""Built low to the ground, with exceptionally strong thighs, chest and upper arms, Christian might have been a good shortstop or soccer midfielder, but it was his exceptional sense of balance that allowed him to pull off aerials that left other skaters shaking their heads"" (Greenfeld, 2004, p.70)."
8430,皮尔森相关（Pearson r) 通常被称为组间相关 (interciass correlation) 。,Pearson r is often called interclass correlation.
8430,此系数是双变数统计，是用来处理两个不同变量间的相关，比如处理评委打分与技能测试分数间的相关。,"This coefficient is a bivariate statistic, meaning that it is used to correlate two variables, as when determining validity by correlating judges’ ratings with scores on a skill test."
8430,但组间相关在建立信度时并不适当，因为信度是计算同一个变数的两个数值间的相关,But interclass correlation is not appropriate for establishing reliability because two values for the same variable are being correlated.
8431,组内相关（R)的计算过程与第9章讨论的单因子重复量数变异数分析(ANOVA)相同，其组成来源为受试者、测试、以及残差的平方和。,"The procedures leading to the calculation of intraclass correlation (R) are the same as those of simple ANOVA with repeated measures, discussed in chapter 9.The components are subjects, trials, and residual sums of squares."
8431,表 11.2是一个ANOVA摘要表的范例。我们将使用表中的数据来计算R。,An example of a summary ANOVA is shown in table 11.2. We use these data to compute R.
8432,6〜18岁男性大腿（□)和手臂（圏) 肌肉耐力（每公斤体重）增长的速率。,Rate increase (per kg) in leg (□) and arm ipt) muscle endurance in males aged 6—18 years old.
8432,大腿 的数据引自Inbar (1985)以及 Inbar & Bar-Or (1986);手臂的数据引自Inbar (1985)和 Blimkie et al. (1988)。,Data from Inbar (1985) and Inbar and Bar-Or (1986) for legs; Inbar (1985) and Blimkie et al. (1988) for arms.
8432,"最大身高增长速度（PHV)是根据文献（Tanner, 1962) 确定的。","Peak height velocity (PHV) is assumed, based on the liturature (Tanner, 1962)."
8432,"PPV,最大功率增长速度。","PPV, peak power velocity."
8433,最大骨骼重量是 一个简单的概念。,
8433,,Peak bone mass is a simple concept that is still in need of clarification.
8433,从理论上说，它是一个个体所获得的最大的骨骼重量。,"Theoretically, it is the highest bone mass that an individual attains."
8433,但是，现有的测试技术不是测试骨骼重量本身。,"However, present measurement techniques do not measure bone mass per se."
8434,对初学者来说，坐姿屈膝是理想的腹部练习动作，因为该动作可以培养良好的脊柱姿势，锻炼腹部肌肉，增强髋部屈肌。,"Knee tucks are an ideal midsection exercise for beginners.They cultivate good spinal posture, condition the abdominal muscles and strengthen the hip flexors."
8434,对大多数人来说，这个动作也相对容易，因此给他们提供了发展完美技巧的绝佳机会，为以后的中段练习做好准备。,They are also relatively easy for most people and for this reason they present a great opportunity to start developing perfect technique for all your midsection exercises.
8434,切记，动作要平缓，呼吸节奏要正确，腹部始终要保持收紧状态。,"Important elements to remember include smooth motion, correct breathing rhythm and keeping the stomach held in tightly."
8435,只有达到悬垂直举腿的精英级别，才能尝试V字举腿。,You should only attempt V raises once you have attained the elite standard of the hanging straight leg raise.
8435,如果你已经达到了，那就继续举腿系列的训练，到另外一天，即等到腹部与腰部肌肉得到充分恢复后再练习V字举腿。,"If you have, and you wish to master V raises, continue your training in leg raises, but work into V raises on a different day, when your stomach and waist muscles are fresh."
8435,先热身，再做一些腰部的柔韧性练习，然后在地上尝试V字举腿动作。,"After performing a warm up and some forward flexibility exercises, learn the movement while sitting on the floor."
8436,我们可以看到此人在两个测验中的表现完全相同。,We see that the person performed exactly the same on the two tests.
8436,两者皆是比平均数高一个标准差。,Both performances were 1 standard deviation above the mean.
8436,与此相似，不同学生的成绩在同样的测验中也可以用z分数相互比较。,"Similarly, scores of different students on the same test can be compared by z scores."
8436,一个垂直跳高37公分的学生z分数是-0.5，而44公分的学生z分数则为0.67，依此类推。,"A student who jumps 37 cm has a z score of -0.5, a student who jumps 44 cm has a z score of 0.67, and so on."
8436,所有的标准分数皆是以z分数为基础。,All standard scores are based on the z score.
8436,但因为z分数有小数点又有正负值，因此不像其他分数一样容易使用。,"But because z scores are expressed in decimals and can be positive or negative, they are not as easy to work with as some other scales."
8437,为了对各种特殊活动包括体育活动的能量消耗进行分类，或者确定每天体力活动水平与总能量消耗的关系，人们引进了MET (代谢单位）的评价概念。,"In order to classify the energy turnover of specific activities including sport activities, or to specify the level of daily physical activity in relation to the total energy turnover, the MET (metabolic units) rating has been introduced."
8437,MET值是活动的能耗除以安静能量消耗的比值。,The MET value is the ratio of the energy cost of an activity divided by Resting energy expenditure.
8437,MET值大约等于该活动的能耗，以kcal • h-1 • kg-1体重表示。成年人的安静能量消耗约为1 kcal • h-1• kg-1 或4.2 kJ • h-1 • kg-1。,This MET value is approximately equal to the energy cost of the activity expressed as kcal • h-1 • kg-1 body weight since REE for adults is roughly 1 kcal • h-1• kg-1 or 4.2 kJ • h-1 • kg-1.
8438,这就是问题的核心所在。,And that is the crux of the proposition.
8438,在过去的一个世纪里，奥运会远不仅仅是一项体育赛事，正是奥林匹克运动历经3000年风雨被细心呵护至今的那些独特的价值，提升了合作伙伴的价值。,"The Olympic Games are far more than just another sporting event.The unique value proposition of the Olympic Movement, carefully nurtured over the past century but able to trace its roots back nearly 3,000 years, is what has driven the value of the partner association."
8438,奥运会特许经营组织，正是在奥林匹克的价值观基础上建立起来的。,The Olympic franchise is built on the Olympic values.
8438,只有通过精心的管理以及长远的合作关系，才能将此维系下去。,It can only be sustained through carefully managed and long-term relationships.
8439,细井的家族传承是评论的主要部分。,His family heritage was a main part of the commentary.
8439,两个叙述中都将克里斯蒂安的父亲 在艺术、自由精神、非法毒品的使用上对他产生的影响放在最重要的位置。,"First, his father's influence on Christian as an artist, free spirit, and user of illicit drugs was foremost in both narratives."
8439,其次，他的种族经常被强调，而霍克的白人身份从未被明确讨论。,"Second, his ethnicity was frequently highlighted, unlike Hawk whose Whiteness is never explicitly discussed."
8440,在人行走时，半月板吸收外界岁膝部的冲击，半月板撕裂会导致发炎，膝部疼痛不俱。,"Your meniscus acts as a shock absorber when youVe walking, and when it tears, it leads to inflammation and a lot of pain."
8440,医生可以利用核磁共振检测诊断半月板是否撕裂。治疗方法主要包括 服用消炎药、冰敷、康复治疗（如果这些方法都不见效，最后还可以进行关节镜手术）。,"Doctors can detect a tear using an MRI; treatment involves anti-inflammatory medication, icing, aggressive rehabilitation (and, if all else fails, arthroscopic surgery)."
8441,“在所有的运动中，为什么棒球运动的奖金相对更髙，那是因为击球的复杂性。”Stephen Kindel (史蒂芬•坎德尔）在福布斯杂志（Forbes)中的一篇文章中这样说，“一位NFL（美国职业橄榄球联盟）的四分卫传球成功率不低于50%，一位美 职篮中锋，投篮得分成功率不低于50%，这些人很快会被训练为股票经纪人或者是卖啤酒的。但是棒球运动数额巨大的合约奖励比例只有0.300，因为击球手的失败率是70%。,"“The complexity of hitting,” noted Stephen Kindel in an article in Forbes magazine, “is why baseball, of all sports, rewards relative failure so well. An NFL quarterback who hits his receiver less than 50% of the time or an NBA center who sinks fewer than half his baskets would soon be training as a stockbroker or selling beer. But baseball rewards 0.300 hitters—failure rates of 70%—with enormous contracts.”"
8442,当从饮食中删除一组食物时，你的感觉会有不同。,"When you eliminate a group from your diet, you’ll notice different things about the way you feel."
8442,例如，你从食谱中删去促使老化的脂肪（饱和脂肪和反式脂肪），会觉得更有精力。这会让你继续坚持吃饱和脂肪含量低的饮食，因为你发现了而且喜欢这些变化。,"For instance, you may have more energy when you eliminate the aging fats (saturated and trans) from your diet, and that'll help you stick to a diet low in saturated fat because you'll notice—and like—the changes."
8443,在这个问题上，自行车运动有另一个学派的思想。,
8443,在中距离项目中，你应该在一开始就全力以赴，以尽快达到次最大比赛节奏。,"In a middle-distance event, you ought to blast off at the start with an all-out effort to bring yourself to the desired, submaximal race pace as quickly as possible."
8443,这个证据是这样的：稳定的骑行节奏是最好的，而且任何的偏差都要消耗宝贵的体能。,"The argument goes like this: Yes, a steady cycling pace is best, and any deviation is energy expensive."
8444,"由于比值标准存在不足，坦纳（1964）建议组间比较采用协方差分析（analysis of covariance）( ANCOVA) ( Snedecor & Cochran, 1980)。在协方差分析中，要将协变量（covariate）的影响分割开来，并计算校正过的均值。","As a result of the imperfections of ratio standards, Tanner (1964) suggested that comparisons between groups should be based on analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) (Snedecor & Cochran, 1980).In ANCOVA, the effect o f a covariate is partitioned out and an adjusted mean is calculated."
8444,该技术的效用得到了证明。,The utility of this technique has been demonstrated.
8445,这些变式并不能代替十式。,These variants are not substitutes for the ten steps.
8445,不过，知道一些变式还是很有必要的。如果你想在自己健身计划中加点儿变化或想在受伤时继续锻炼，就会用到这些动作。,"All the same, it’s handy to know some of the variants in case you fancy adding some variety into your routine or if you’re working around injuries."
8446,最简单的差异比较是只有两个组别之间的比较：t考验。,The simplest comparison of differences is between two groups: the t test.
8446,接着介绍变异数分析，这是检验两组或更多组别之间差异性的方法。,"Next, we describe analysis of variance as a means of testing the significance of the differences among two or more groups."
8446,我们也讨论了多因子变异数分析，也就是同时比较两个或更多个自变项。,"We also discuss the use of factorial analysis of variance, by which two or more independent variables can be compared."
8447,许多家伙都害怕深蹲，因为他们认为深蹲将加重膝盖旧伤。,"Many guys are afraid of the squat, because they think it will aggravate old knee injuries."
8447,其实事实恰恰相反。,"In fact, the opposite is usually true."
8447,做标准深蹲时，增加的血液流动可以移除累积的废物，恢复旧伤组织，缓解疼痛。,"The increased blood flow and range of motion in full squats removes waste build-up and stretches old scar tissue, alleviating pain."
8447,膝盖及其周围的矶肉与肌腱将变得更强、更柔韧，再受伤的可能性也大大减小了。,"The knees and surrounding muscles and tendons become stronger and more flexible, and the likelihood of future injuries is lessened."
8448,有些感染会大大影响你的生活，比如爱泼斯坦-巴尔病毒，能攻击你的肝并造成传染性单核细胞增多症，使脾脏肿胀。,"Other infections change the way you live.The Epstein-Barr virus, for example, attacks your liver and causes infections mononucleosis with a spleen swollen with immune cells ready for battle."
8448,"病毒的一个弱点是为了能入侵细胞,它需要某种运输方式，也就是它需要一种化学的运输体把它运送到那里。","One of the weaknesses of viruses is that in order for a virus to invade a cell, it needs some mode of of transportation—it needs a chemical transporter to take it there."
8448,最新的病毒治疗方法集中致力于阻断运输体以便病毒到达不了细胞。,The latest therapies for virus can't get into the cells.
8449,如果把疼痛分为1到10级，背痛的级别是6.92。,"If you've ever strained your back, you know that on the scale of 1 to 10, the pain ranks at a 6.92."
8449,疼痛会给人带来麻痹的感觉——行走、坐下、睡觉，行动都很困难。,"It can be paralyzing—making if difficult to walk, to sit, to get up, to sleep, to do anything."
8449,这时你就只想躺下，把脑袋埋在枕头里。,"All you want to do is to lie down, prop your head on some pillows."
8449,此刻最美的事莫过于生活伴侣给你递来冰袋和布洛芬，并奉上最新一期Tattoo Today杂志。,"And you can think of nothing better than having your spouse deliver ice packs, ibuprofen, and the latest issue of Tattoo Today directly to your bed（4）."
8450,任何一种常模调查的实施，都必须透过严谨及标准化的测量程序。,"In any normative survey, the test must be administered in a rigidly standardized manner."
8450,测量方式如果出现差异 ，所得到的结果就不具参考价值。,Deviations in the way measurements are taken give meaningless results.
8450,研究者使用百分位数、 T 分数或标准九等标准化分数来分析所收集到的数据，同时分别依据年龄、性别等类别来建立常模。,"The researcher collects and analyzes the data from the survey by some norming method, such as percentiles, T scores, or stanines, and then constructs norms for the categories of age, sex, and so on."
8451,常态科学随着爱因斯坦相对论和量子论的发明而受到极大的冲击。因为这二种理论皆指出自然的法则会受到人类的影响（也就是说，事物的真实性有很大的一部分要看当事者的知觉）。,"Normal science received a terrific jolt with Einstein’s theory of relativity and the quantum theory, which indicated that nature’s laws could be influenced by humans (that is, that reality depends to a great extent on how one perceives it)."
8451,再者，有些事情的发生，像是放射性核子的 衰退，全无理由可言。,"Moreover, some things, such as the decay of a radioactive nucleus, happen for no reason at all."
8452,体重超重或患有其他疾病的人在开始任何体育锻炼前， 都要先咨询医生。,"If you're overweight or have other medical conditions, you should consult your doctor before starling any exercise program."
8452,开始时先是小运动。每天散步五分钟，然后每隔几天就延长一到两分钟。,"Start small: Walk five minutes a day, and increase by one or two minutes every few days."
8453,当我们按出生年龄来分析运动上的成功时，就会明了。,This comes to light when sport success is analyzed by birth date.
8453,由于大多数青年赛事中，竞赛都是按年龄来分组的，按照比赛认证的年份，一个生于年初的孩子体格可能更大——可能在力量运动上更有优势——相比于那些生于年尾的孩子。,"Since competition is grouped by age category in most youth sports, a child who is born at the first part of the qualifying year can be expected to be bigger—and perhaps more skillful in strength and power activities—than one whose birth date is in the later part of the year."
8453,但是这两个孩子都将在同一组中里进行比赛。,Yet both will be playing at the same level of team competition.
8454,青春期早期以前的数据与以往使用敏感性较低的方法的很多研究结果是一致的（虽然不是定量的研究）。,From early puberty onw ard the data are consistent (although not quantitatively) w ith those from m any previous studies using less sensitive assays.
8454,这些研究结果显示，增强的促黄体生成激素脉（LH）冲性释放——最早只在夜间—— 紧接着有一个不平衡的分泌期，大部分是在夜间，最后到成年的释放方式，即间歇性的脉冲释放，在月经的卵泡期的频率大约是每90秒钟释放一次。,"They showaugm ented, pulsatile release of luteinizing hormone (LH) — at first, only at night — followed by a period of unbalanced secretion w ith the great m ajority at night, and finally to the adult pattern o f intermittent pulsatile release with a frequency of one pulse approxim ately every 90 mm in the early follicular phase of the m enstrual cycle."
8454,卵巢接受逐渐增加的生物学上有活性的促性腺激素刺激后，会产生越来越多的雌二醇。,The ovary is stim ulated to produce increasing quantities of oestradiol by the increasing concentrations of biologically active gonadotrophins.
8455,运动是非常重要的。,There are a couple of reasons why exercise is so important.
8455,不论运动量大小，既能降低收缩压（心脏收缩时承受的压力），又能降低舒张压（心脏放松时的动脉压力）。这两者都是动脉老化最重要的指标，尤其是舒张压。,"For one, any amount of physical activity lowers both systolic (the pressure being exerted when the heart contracts; the first or top number) and diastolic (the pressure in the arteries when the heart is at rest; the bottom or second number) blood pressure, which are the most important factors in arterial aging."
8455,即使每天散步几分钟，也能降低体内有害胆固醇LDL)含量，提高健康胆固醇（HDL含量，减少发炎，还有其他益处。,"Even walking just a few extra minutes a day lowers your lousy (LDL) cholesterol, raises your healthy (HDL) cholesterol, and decreases inflammation, among other benefits."
8456,高脂饮食会导致胆囊收缩，更增加了结石带来的痛苦。,"Fatty meals, which cause your gallbladder to contract, can increase the pain from your existing stones."
8456,这里有一个方法可以检验自己的腹痛是否是由胆结石引起的。,So there's a way that you can actually test yourself to see if your belly pain is caused by gallstones.
8456,去快餐店吃少量高脂饮食，比如一两块肯德基原味炸鸡（不错，这是惟一一次医生向你推荐这种食品）。,"Go out and eat a small amount of a highly fatty fast-food meal, like a piece or two of original Kentucky Fried Chicken (yes, this is the only time you'll hear us recommend that)."
8457,高脂饮食会导致胆囊收缩，更增加了结石带来的痛苦。,"Fatty meals, which cause your gallbladder to contract, can increase the pain from your existing stones."
8457,这里有一个方法可以检验自己的腹痛是否是由胆结石引起的。,So there's a way that you can actually test yourself to see if your belly pain is caused by gallstones.
8457,去快餐店吃少量高脂饮食，比如一两块肯德基原味炸鸡（不错，这是惟一一次医生向你推荐这种食品）。,"Go out and eat a small amount of a highly fatty fast-food meal, like a piece or two of original Kentucky Fried Chicken (yes, this is the only time you'll hear us recommend that)."
8458,等你做引体向上的能力变强了，比如，到了无需作弊就可以做第五式的水平，这时就可以通过蹬腿来增加动作次数了。,Once you become stronger at pullups—when you can do Step 5 without cheating—then you can begin to productively use kipping in your workouts.
8458,先做严格规范的动作，尽量多做，至少要3-4次，然后再借助蹬腿产生的力多做一次、二次，甚至三次。这样可以让你突破正常的界限，全展更强的肌肉耐力。,"Do as many reps as you can strictly—at least three or four—then use kipping to generate the power to do another one, two or even three reps. This will allow you to push past your normal barriers and develop more muscular stamina than you otherwise could."
8459,CrossFit是一套进行力量和代谢调节训练的课程计划，由美国的 格雷格•格拉斯曼教练创立。,CrossFit is a strength and conditioning program created by Greg Glassman.
8459,格拉斯曼教练在《CrossFit期刊》中是 这样定义CrossFit的:CrossFit由 “高强度不断变化的功能性动作组成，要求训练者在指定的时间和场地范围内完成训练任务”。,"As defined by Glassman in the CrossFit Journal, CrossFit consists of “constantly varied functional movements executed at high intensity across broad time and modal domains.”"
8459,每周去3次传统健身房的人，通常每次会进行同样的25 分钟一轮的器械训练。他们单独训练不同部位的肌群，每个肌群的训练完成两组，每组重复10次。,"Consider the person who goes to a gym three times a week and performs the same 25-minute circuit of machines that isolate specific muscle groups, completing 2 sets of 10 reps for each exercise."
8460,体内血糖含量应低于lOOmg/dl。,Keep it lower than 100 mg/dl.
8460,糖尿病患者的血液中含糖量过高，会降低一种特殊的磷激酶的活性，从而对动脉造成伤害。磷激酶能够让动脉自如地扩张收缩。,"The excess sugar in the blood that's caused by diabetes damages the arteries by inactivating a specific phosphokinase, a substance that makes it possible for your arteries to dilate smoothly and contract."
8460,没有这种酶，不同部位动脉的血管壁连接处出现裂缝坑洞的可能性就会大大增加。,"Without that phosphokinasc, the risk of holes or cracks appearing at junctions in the arterial walls increases dramatically."
8460,因此我们所有人，不只是糖尿病患者，都应尽量避免食用含有较多单糖类和饱和反式脂肪的食品，例如果冻甜面圈。,"So all of us, not just diabetics, really want to avoid foods that are high in simple sugars and saturated and trans fats, like jelly doughnuts."
8461,极简跑鞋同样对灵活性有帮助。,Minimalist shoes can also make a contribution to mobility.
8461,传统跑鞋为脚部动作提供了相当多的支撑，而极简跑鞋提供的多方面灵活性在于让双脚尽量自然活动。,"While traditional shoes provide considerable control over foot movement, minimalist shoes have multidirectional flexibility that is designed to let the foot move as naturally as possible."
8461,跑者最终将因此获得更大的灵活性。,"Ultimately, this leads to greater mobility."
8462,进行预测研究时，样本的参与者人数应该要够多。,In prediction studies the number of participants in the sample should be sufficiently large.
8462,通常，样本数越大，越有可能代表样本取样的母群体。,"Usually, the larger the sample, the more likely it will be to represent the population from which it is drawn."
8462,使用小样本数的多元回归研究的另一问题在于相关性可能高得不符逻辑。,Another problem with small samples in multiple-regression studies is that the correlation may be spuriously high.
8462,从参与者人数到变项数目，其相关性与比例属直接关系。,A direct relationship exists between the correlation and the ratio of the number of participants to the number of variables.
8463,15%的女性被诊断出患有二尖瓣脱垂。,Fifteen percent of women are diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse.
8463,尽管男性瓣膜也会有异常问题发生，但是与瓣膜松软有关的心悸、出虛汗和心慌综合征通常出现在年轻女性身上。,"Although men also have abnormal valves, the syndrome of palpitations, sweating, and panic attacks that is associated with these floppy valves is usually found in young women."
8463,这种瓣膜问题应该用β-受体阻滞剂治疗，但是大多数人会放任情况进一步发展。,"It can be treated with drugs called beta-blockers, but most folks end up outgrowing the condition."
8464,二手文献则为由那些并非直接与事件或主题相关的人所写的书籍或文章。,Secondary sources are sources such as books and articles written by people who were not directly associated with the event or topic.
8464,在许多情况下，二手文献是由那些已经完成他们第一手数据及基本调查的人，所写出来的。,"In many cases, they are written by researchers who have done their own primary source-based research."
8464,然而，由于资料过滤的程度是由他人去检验的，对于历史学家而言，相关二手文献显得较没价值。,"However, the degree of filtering resulting from having been examined by others makes secondary sources less valuable to historians."
8465,现在对于研究生长发育的生物学家和儿童运动生理学家来说是一个激动的时刻。,This is an exciting time for developmental biologists and paediatric exercise physiologists.
8465,在研究儿童发育过程心肺系统对运动反应时，现在已经有了新的方法可供选用。,New methodologies are now available to focus on mechanisms of maturation of the cardiorespiratory response to exercise in children.
8465,例如，MRI和 P MRS方法可以对生长发育阶段结构和机能的变化进行无创性测定。,"For example, MRI and P M RS allow noninvasive assessments of growth and development of both anatomic and functional importance."
8466,研究还显示，那些经常吃同一类食品的女性得临床乳腺癌的几率会降低30%—50%。,And studies have also shown that the risk of developing clinical breast cancer is 30 to 50 percent lower among women who frequently eat similar kinds of foods.
8466,许多人认为其中的有效成分即造成这一惊人数字的成分是番茄红素。这是一种类胡萝卜素，因其抗氧化机能而著名。,"Many believe that the active ingredient-the ingredient responsible for such astounding numbers—is lycopene, a carotenoid known for its antioxidant properties."
8467,少儿运动科学家在阐明青年退出运动的原因时碰到的最大阻碍之一在于定义上的障碍。,One of the major barriers paediatric sport scientists have encountered in an effort to explain the drop-out dilemma in youth sports focuses on definitional hurdles.
8467,大多数早期研究者把青少年分成以下3类。,Most of the early research classifies children and adolescents into one of the following categories.1
8467,1.参与者：目前正在参加一项特定 运动项目。,Participant: an athlete who is currently participating in a specific sport programme.
8467,2.中途退出者：不再参加任何一项 特定运动项目。,2 Drop-out: an individual who is no longer involved in that particular programme.
8467,3.非参与者：从未参加过任何特定 运动项目。,3 Non-participant: an individual who has never been involved in that particular programme.
8467,确切地说，这些类别是根据对个人是否参加运动的现状进行研究与评估后得出的。,"Typically, these classifications were made after the fact and assessed the individual's current status of sport involvement or non-involvement."
8467,这些描述意味着，少年儿童要么参与运动要么退出运动，不存在第三种情况。,These definitions infer an all-or-nothing meaning to sport participation or withdrawal.
8468,然而更小的微粒，肉眼通常无法看见，能溜过防御系统，就像出色的足球前锋带球突破后卫防守，直闯对手禁区。,"But even smaller particles, particles we cant actually see—can slip through the defense system much like a great running back breaks tackles."
8468,如果没被察觉，这些微粒就会引发炎症，损坏部分肺部组织，进而还会带来更大的危害。,"Undetected, these particles actually cause an inflammatory reaction that destroys part of your lung tissue—and puts you at greater risk for various lung disorders."
8468,（正因为此，钠米技术制造业可能就很危险了，因为它报废的产品都是小分子。）,(Thats why nanotechnology manufacturing may be dangerous: the waste product is all small particles.)
8469,在风湿热发生初期如果没有心肌炎的发生，疾病的预后是良好的。,The prognosis is excellent for subjects to escape carditis during an initial attack of rheumatic fever.
8469,初期的心肌炎及其后果的严重程度越大，预后就越坏。,The prognosis worsens with increasing severity of the initial carditis and its sequelae.
8469,从风湿热急性期恢复并且没有合并心肌炎的人可以参加所有的体育运动。,"Individuals who have recovered from the acute phase of rheumatic fever and do not have carditis, may participate in all athletic activities."
8470,我们并不是说一个变项无法造成另一变项的产生；事实上，根据我们所提出的负相关例子，可说明将球打得越远，开球准确率便会越低（因为开球准确率是依据球员开球上球道率而定）。但是，这项关系并不代表着因果关系。,"We are not saying that one variable cannot be the cause of another; in fact, using our example of a negative correlation, it is likely that driving the golf ball farther does cause a decrease in driving accuracy (as determined by the percentage of fairways that the player hits), but establishing that relationship does not establish cause and effect."
8470,要产生因果关系，两个变项必须具有相关性。,"For cause and effect to occur, the two variables must be correlated."
8471,增强肌腱和韧带力量。,Building tendon and ligament strength.
8471,LSD跑步确实可以帮助增强这些结构，但是就像生物学家图多尔•博帕指出的，6周的负重训练同样可以大大增强结缔组织的力量。,"LSD running may help strengthen these structures, but as exercise physiologist Tudor Bompa has pointed out, 6 weeks of weight training can also generate substantial connective tissue gains."
8471,由于负重训练和增强式训练可以有针对性地增强肌腱和韧带力量，所以比起单纯进行大量的跑步训练，CFE模式的训练计划可以更有效地改善这些组织结构。,"Further, because a weight training and plyometrics progression can target and improve specific tendons and ligaments, a CFE-type program may be more efficient and effective at improving these structures than just pounding the sidewalk for as many miles as you can."
8472,2009年4月12日，在英式橄榄球联盟喜力杯哈勒奎因队（英国伦敦）与伦斯特队（爱尔兰）的1/4决赛中，哈勒奎因队的队员汤姆•威廉姆斯(Tom Williams)在比赛只有最后几分钟时口吐鲜血，似乎是受了伤。,"On April 12, 2009, at rugby union's Heineken Cup quarter-final involving Harlequins (of London, England) and Leinster (of Ireland), Harlequins' player, Tom Williams, appeared to sustain an injury as blood gushed from his mouth with just minutes remaining in the game."
8472,这起突发事件让哈勒奎因队可以“流血换人”，尼克•埃文斯（Nick Evans)上场。,"The incident permitted Harlequins to make a ""blood substitution,"" allowing Nick Evans to come on to the field."
8472,比赛到了这个时候，正常来说哈勒奎因队已经不允许替换队员，“流血换人”是唯一能让埃文斯（久经沙场的攻击手，潜在的获胜武器）出场的一种方式。,"At this point of the game, Harlequins would normally not be allowed to make a player replacement; a ""blood substitution"" was the only possible means of getting Evans (a recognized kicker and potential game-winner) onto the field."
8473,如同世代研究，个案对照研究 (case control studies)的目的也在于找出与疾病结果有因果关系的因子。,"The case-control study, like the cohort study, aims to identify factors that are causally related to disease outcome.In this design, people with disease (i.e."
8473,这项设计将有疾病者(即个案组) 与无病者(即对照组)在同一时期招募至一个研究中。,", cases) and without disease (i.e., controls) are recruited into the study over the same period."
8473,无病对照样本的选择通常系透过潜在 的重要干扰因子如：年龄与族裔，与有病个案进行配对 (matching)。,"Frequently, the disease-free control subjects are selected to match cases with respect to potentially important confounding factors, such as age or ethnicity."
8473,其次 ，两组都将经由面访或自填问卷的方式，询问他们在致病因子的暴露情形。,Both cases and controls are then asked about their exposures to potential causal factors using in-person interviews or self-administered questionnaires.
8473,因此，个案对照研究的目的在于透过回溯性 (retrospective)的暴露评估，以找出在疾病自然史之诱导期中(即在发病之前)产生致病影响的因子 。,"Thus, the objective of this retrospective exposure assessment in case-control studies is to identify factors that influenced the natural history of the disease during its induction period (i.e., before disease onset)."
8474,如果干细胞已经被损坏，接受适当的干细胞治疗会启动功能恢复机制。,"When damage has already occurred, receiving appropriate stem cell therapies could prime the pump of recovery of funefion."
8474,有关于此的道德困境在于从哪里获取干细胞，因为目前最好的来源是晶状受精卵，这些受精卵是其父母贡献者无法再用的。,"The moral dilemma is where to get the stem cells from, since the best sources today are from unused in vifro fertilized eggs that the biologic parents can no longer use."
8474,判断生命是从什么时候开始的是一个非常敏感的问题，但是许多科学家却看好在此领域的继续发现所带来的益处。,"Deciding when life begins is a very personal issue, but many scientists appreciate the potential benefits of continued exploration in this field."
8475,叶酸是维生素B的一种。专家已经证实，叶酸在很多方面对人类健康有重要作用，不过对于人体心脏来说，它的意义更不寻常。每日补充400微克叶酸，能将高半胱氨酸含量降到健康水平，让高半胱氨酸含量原来为26mg/dl(健康水平应低于9mg/dl)的人年轻6岁。,"Folic acid is a B vitamin, which has proven to be essential to human health in various ways, but for your heart, it has a crucial role: a daily dose of 400 micrograms (half from food is normal) lowers homocysteine to healthy levels, and makes the person whose homocysteine level is 26 mg/dl (the level you should shoot for is less than 9 mg/dl) about six years younger."
8476,黄斑包括许多视锥细胞，也有一些杆状细咆。黄斑会随着我们年老而变性，导致最常见的老年视觉问题。,"The macula, which contains many cones but also some rods, can deteriorate as we age—making it the most common cause of age-related vision problems."
8476,这种变性有两种形式。,This degeneration comes in two forms.
8476,第一种是较常见的干式病变。,One is the more common dryform.
8476,虽然我们并不知道其中确切的原因，但是我们知道那些抽烟的人和有高血压的人易受到这种因素的影响。,"Although the exact cause is unknown, we know that those who smoke, and have high blood pressure are most affected."
8477,如果你自己随意服用合成代谢类固醇、减肥药或治疗其他疾病的速效药，你就是在跟你的激素瞎胡闹，就会让身体出现故障。,"Anytime you try fiddling with your hormones on your own with anabolic steroids or fixes for weight loss or other ailments, you're causing your body to go haywire."
8477,比如我们经常会了解到一些运动员通过服用代谢类固醇药或补充剂，使其代谢产生睾丸酮。,"For example, we often read about athletes who take androgenic steroids or supplements that get metabolized through to testosterone."
8477,这些多余的睾丸酮会导致非常具有侵略性的行为，所以千万不要给服用者手枪，或者什么辩题，更别提这些药产生所有的副作用，像心血管病和肾脏类病。,"This excess tesfosterone can lead to very aggressive behavior—as in, don't give that man a gun or even an argument—not to mention all the side effects like cardiovascular and kidney problems."
8478,纵跳的高度(H)是依据以下的公式计算的：H = vt2-2g-1这里的vt=起跳速度，g=重力加速度。,The height of the jump (H) is measured according to the formula:H = vt2-2g-1where vt = take-off velocity and g = acceleration due to gravity.
8478,力的峰值是在起跳前与测力台接触时的最大的力。,Peak force is the recording of maximal force during the time of contact on the platform before take-off.
8478,该试验被认为是测试跳跃功率的黄金标准，并用来验证其他无氧功率试验的有效性。,The test is considered as the gold standard in jump power testing and has been used for validation of other anaerobic power tests.
8479,巩固训练是处理这种状况的好办法。,Consolidation training is an excellent way of coping with this situation.
8479,不是一周锻炼一两次，每次都努力增加次数，而是尝试每天都练习这个新动作，有时甚至是一天 练习两三回。,"Instead of working the new exercise once or twice a week and struggling to improve your reps every time, try working the new exercise every day—sometimes even twice or three times a day."
8479,放松，然后每回不是尽可能做更多次，而是最多只做一两次。,"Loosen up, then instead of doing as many reps as possible, only do one—two at the very most."
8479,很可能是早晨醒来做一次单臂引体向上，午饭后再做一次，熄灯前再做一次，诸如此类。,"Maybe do one rep of a half one-arm pullup when you wake up; another one after lunch; another before lights out, and so on."
8480,我不知道为什么巩固训练会起作用，但它的的确确有用。,"I don’t know why consolidation training works, but it definitely does work."
8480,有人告诉我说这是因为相比一次长时锻炼，多次的短时锻炼可以更有效地“教”神经系统处理相应的动作技巧。,I’ve been told that it works because the multiple mini-sessions “teach” the nervous system how to manage the technique in a more efficient way than just one prolonged session can.
8480,不要在那些你已经能做多次反复的动作上使用巩固训练，只有在升级到新的、让你真正遇到挑战的高级技巧时才使用它。,"Don’t use it for exercises where you can already get multiple reps—keep it for those occasions when you move up to a new, advanced technique which you find a real struggle."
8481,在本章中，我们讨论了测量的效度与信度的概念，以及在研究中的应用。,"In this chapter, we discussed the concepts of validity and reliability of measurements and their application to research."
8481,效标效度(包含同时效度与预测效度)及构念效度是研究中用来证实测量效度最常用的两种方法。,Criterion validity (which includes both concurrent and predictive validity) and construct validity are two of the most popular methods of validating measures used in research studies.
8481,有一个常被提出与预测测量有关的问题是普遍性或情境专属。,One problem often identified regarding predictive measures is population or situation specificity.
8481,另外也讨论了使用预期表的价值。,The value of using expectancy tables was discussed.
8482,由罗伯特·坎贝尔（Robert Campbell) 在美国申请专利的一种新型的骨骼宽度测量夹子带有两只滑动的测量臂，将骨骼宽度测量的精度提高了一步。,A new small bone caliper based on a US patent for a double-sliding branch principle by Robert Campbell provides for a new level of precision in measuring bone breadths.
8482,测量臂末端的压力稳定，不紧也不松。,The design permits firm pressure on the ends of the branches without binding.
8482,Campbell 10夹子以发明人的名字命名，是按照独家专利协议由Rosscraft公司生产的。,"The Campbell Caliper 10, named after the inventor, is manufactured by Rosscraft under exclusive patent agreement."
8482,这种夹子有两个游标尺，可以从上下两个方向进行读数。,It has double vernier scales to permit reading in an up and down orientation.
8483,Siber-Hegner式人体测量器无关节的终端部分是用大范围的滑动夹子来测量躯干的宽度的；而Mitutoyo式小的夹子是用 于骨骼宽度测量的。,The disarticulated end piece of the Siber-Hegner anthropometer is used as a large wide sliding caliper for torso breadths; and small Mitutoyo adapted caliper for bone breadths.
8483,测量器必须组装合适。,The anthropometer must be assembled properly.
8483,滑动臂必须在操作者的右手侧。,The sliding branch should be on your right-hand side.
8483,在测量器闭合时，显示器上的读数应该是0.7 mm (夹子两个臂在闭合时分开的距离）。,"When closed, the anthropometer indicator should read 0.7m m (the small distance the branches are apart when fully closed)."
8483,滑动夹子和骨骼夹子的控制方法是相同的。,Both the sliding and the bone calipers are held in the same manner.
8484,女性只是普遍在患病时间上比男性提前，因为女性的骨密度和骨质量都比男性小。,Women just tend to get osteoporosis earlier because women's bone density and bone mass are naturally thinner.
8484,在绝经后，女性的骨密度也会降低，因为有助于钙质累积的雌性激素此时分泌量减少。,"Women also lose bone density after menopause, since they lose some estrogen, which is paramount in helping deposit calcium."
8484,不过男性稍后的骨质疏松发病率也就和女性并驾齐驱了。男性一到75岁，雄性激素和睾丸激累分泌量普遍下降，不足以维持骨骼的密度和质量。,"But men—catch up later; as they reach seventy-five, they lack both the mass and sufficient estrogen and testosterone to help build bone."
8485,大家一谈到骨质疏松症，可能就会想到骨折、骨裂。,"When you think of osteoporosis, you probably think of bone breaks."
8485,的确，这是骨密度下降带来的负面后果。但是，骨折、骨裂还不是 骨质疏松馥主要的危害。,Surely that s the danger of having thin bones- But its not the break itself that makes osteoporosis so bad.
8485,骨折还会引发一连串与衰老有关的问题。,Its what happens afterward.The fracture triggers a chain of aging- related events.
8486,对于抗击骨质疏松症，我们很有信心，尤其是因为我们可以通过调节自己身体有序地工作，让自己保持年轻。,"We are optimistic about osteoporosis, especially because you can take control of your own body and keep yourself younger."
8486,从事足量的体育活动、控制血压、戒掉香烟，就是远离疾病的正确手段。,"If you are getting enough physical activity，controlling your blood pressure, and eliminating cigarettes, you're well on your way to keeping the disease at bay."
8486,再说一件值得高兴的事。自1988年至2003年，骨质疏松在骨折发生前就被检测到的例子翻了七倍。,"Another item to celebrate: From 1988 to 2003, there was a sevenfold increase in the detection of osteoporosis before a fracture occurred."
8487,髋关节是人体最强健的关节，结构具有球和球座组合的特点，保证了肢体运动的稳定性。不过缺点与优点相伴而生。,"Our strongest joint, the hip, has a ball socket construction that gives us staoility, but at a price."
8487,髋关节伸展困难，容易患关节炎而变得僵硬，使患者髋关节会感觉像灌进了沙子一样难受。,The joint is difficult to stretch out and is prone to stiffening with arthritis.The effect is that your joint feels as if sand is being poured into the joint.
8488,（a)直腿抬高，受试者仰卧，保持膝关节伸展，被动抬高腿、屈曲髋关节，直至感觉抗阻或对侧大腿开始从检查床向上移动（提示骨盆开始旋转)。,"(a) For the straight leg raise, the youth is supine and the examiner passively flexes the hip by lifting the foot, with the knee extended, until resistance is felt or the contralateral thigh begins to move upward from the examining table (indicating that the pelvis has rotated)."
8488,直腿抬高的角度是指下肢与检查床之间的成角。（b)腘窝角试验不应大于10° (Holt方法）；直腿抬高应能达到85°。,"The straight leg raise angle is formed between the extremity and the examining table,(b) The popliteal angle test should measure no greater than 10°  (Holt's method), and the straight leg raise should be possible to 85°."
8489,心血管素质下降是过度保护的表现。,Low cardiovascular fitness reflecting overprotection.
8489,注意选择有氧活动的方式， 防止严重的摔伤。,Care in selection of aerobic activities that may result in serious falls.
8489,游 泳和自行车练习是低撞击的运动方式。,Swimming and cycling as low impact adjuncts to training regimens.
8490,踝关节骨折常发生在胫骨和腓骨骺板 (生长板）闭合前，15-16岁时。,Fractures of the ankle usually occur prior to the closure of the tibial and fibular growth plates at approximately 15 -16 years of age.
8490,踝关节骨折包括外旋损伤所致的胫骨远端蒂拉克斯骨折（Tillaux fracture)和二翼型 (triplane)骨折。,Injuries involving external rotations may result in a Tillaux and triplane fracture at the distal tibiia.
8490,内翻损伤可导致腓骨远 端骺板萨尔特-哈理斯（Salter-Harris) I型和II型骨折。,An inversion injury may result in a Salter— Harris type I or II fracture of the distal fibular growth plate.
8491,通过睡眠，大脑对肠胃功能也能发挥作用。,"Through sleep, your brain also plays a role in gut functions."
8491,如果你想少进食，那就多睡觉。,"If you want to eat less, get more sleep."
8491,假如你睡眠不足，人体就会分泌较多的饥饿激素，释放较少的瘦素。,"When you don't sleep enough, more ghrelin is secreted and less leptin is released."
8491,所以缺乏睡眠造成的影响和高果糖玉米糖浆相同，都会让你增加进食次数，吃得更多。,So lack of sleep can have the same effect as HFCS by causing you to eat more often.
8492,无氧运动能力是一个比较复杂的概念。,Anaerobic performance is a rather complex concept.
8492,在文献中，它常常作为肌肉功率的同义语。,In the literature it is often defined as synonymous with muscle power.
8492,例如，像冲刺这样一项无氧作业包含着短时间的爆发性用力。,"An anaerobic task like, for example, sprinting involves a short burst of effort."
8492,这种活动需要对肌肉最大活动供应即刻的能量，可是，我们也可以将所有通过“无氧”能量释放所完成的短时间的肌肉的发力和工作定义为运动能力。,"Such an activity requires an immediate availability of energy to power maximum muscular activity.However, we can also consider that all short-term muscular force and work done by means of 'anaerobic' energy release can be defined as performance."
8493,肌肉的横断面研究已经证实了许多变量对肌肉功能的重要性。,Cross-sectional research studies have verified the importance of a number of variables for muscle function.
8493,例如，已有报告指出短跑能力与以下因素显著相关：爆发力（如纵跳高度）、蹲举力量、跳深、测力台的测试，以及等长和等速力量的测试。,"For example, significant correlations with sprinting performance have been reported for explosive strength (as indicated by height of vertical jump), strength on squat lifts, drop jumps, force production on a platform, and measures of both isometric and isokinetic strength."
8493,这些研究结果需要考虑肌肉群测试，因为在短跑的不同阶段，特定的肌肉对向前推动力的贡献各不相同。,"Findings in such studies need to take in account the muscle groups tested, since the contribution of specific muscles to forward propulsion varies in the different phases of the sprint."
8494,彼得•科埃的方法包含了高强度功能力量循环训练——是麦肯齐的CFE方法的先驱。,Peter Coe’s method included high-intensity functional strength training in a circuit—a precursor to MacKenzie’s CFE approach.
8494,科埃认为循环训练的益处包括获得更好的姿势、更强的耐力和肌肉控制力、更好的协调能力和更强的结缔组织。,"Coe believed that the benefits of circuit training included better posture, improved endurance and muscle recruitment, better coordination, and stronger connective tissues."
8494,一套彼得•科埃研发的循环训练方案包括2 ~ 5组循环练习，如每组包含臂屈伸、背部伸展、仰卧起坐、俯卧撑、负重深蹲起和攀爬绳子练习。,"A Peter Coe–designed circuit workout consisted of 2 to 5 circuits of exercises such as dips, back extensions, sit-ups, push-ups, squat thrusts, burpees, and a rope climb."
8495,随着年龄的增长，我们的身体会分泌更少的睾丸酮和人体生长荷尔蒙。,"As we age, our bodies produce less testosterone and human growth hormone."
8495,这会导致我们的肌肉量逐渐减少，速度逐渐变慢。,The result is a gradual loss of muscle mass and speed.
8495,我们不能阻止人体老化的过程，但是可以通过不同形式的力量训练减缓这一过程。,"The aging process cannot be stopped, but it can be slowed down by engaging in various forms of strength training."
8495,这也是参与CFE训练的益处之一。,That’s one of the benefits of adopting the CFE method of training.
8496,控制肌肉收缩顺序的是脊髓本身。,Control of this sequence of muscle contractions lies in the spinal cord itself.
8496,我们知道这一点，是因为如果你除去七鳃鳗的大脑，然后电刺激它的脊髓，你仍然可以见到它协调的游泳动作。,"We know this because if you remove the lamprey’s brain and then electrically stimulate the spinal cord, you still witness coordinated swimming motion."
8496,而且，甚至是将脊髓切成块，只留下两三个肌肉段，电刺激仍然可以引起剩下的肌肉做类似游泳的活动。,"And, if you go so far as to chop the spinal cord into pieces containing only two or three muscle segments, electrical stimulation still causes swim-like activity in what muscle still remains."
8497,伴随衰老，神经系统的退化加剧了肌肉力量的下降。,Neurological degeneration adds to the decline in muscle strength with aging.
8497,运动性神经细胞负责控制肌纤维，目前预测它会以每年1%的速度丢失。,The motor nerve cells that are responsible for activating muscle fibers are lost at the now predictable rate of 1% yearly.
8497,中枢神经系统中神经元的类似丢失解释了反应时间延长和运动协调性退化的原因。,Similar loss of neurons in the central nervous system explains deterioration of reaction times and motor coordination.
8498,从化学方面看，人体肠道是最近似于大脑的器官，两者的神经递质和激素都是惊人的相像。,"Chemically, your intestines are the organ most similar to your brain, in that the neurotransmitters and hormones are remarkably alike."
8498,肠道上布满了神经细胞，控制肠壁肌肉运动，将食物向下输送。,Your intestines are loaded with neurons that keep the muscles that line your intestinal pipe working to move food down.
8498,肠道控制食物出入人体的方式，就像明星的私人助理浏览“粉丝”来信一样，决定什么应该留下，什么要扔掉。,"When your intestines shuttle food into and out of your system, they act almost like a celebrity's personal assistant who goes through fan mail.They decide what stays and what gets tossed."
8499,另一种广泛研究的加速度测量仪被称为卡尔特拉克（Caltrac)。,Another extensively studied accelerometer is the so-called Caltrac.
8499,一项现场研究将Caltrac计数值与双标记水方法相结合， 结果表明与能量消耗量明显相关（r = 0.54) (Gretebeck et al，1991)。,"A field study correlating Caltrac values with the DLW method showed a significant correlation with energy turnover (r = 0.54) (Gretebeck et al., 1991)."
8499,来自呼吸仓研究的结果说明，相关系数甚至更高 (r= 0.92) (Schutz et a7，1988)。,"Results from a respiration chamber study showed even better results (r = 0.92) (Schütz et al., 1988)."
8500,肩峰间距（biacromial breadth)是指在受试者笔直站立，双臂下垂、紧靠身体两侧时，肩峰突起的最外侧点之间的距离。,Biacromial breadth refers to the distance between the most lateral points on the acromion processes when the subject stands erect with the arms hanging loosely at the sides.
8500,操作者站在受试者背后，用中指寻找测量部位。要使用大范围滑动夹子的双臂进行测量。,"Stand behind the subject, locate the sites with your third fingers and apply the branches of the wide sliding caliper."
8500,"将夹子双臂向上与水平面约呈45°,测量肩峰突起间的最大径线。",Position the branches to point upward at an angle of about 450 from the horizontal encompassing the largest diameter between the acromial processes.
8500,用食指沿着夹子双臂外侧（而不是在夹子尖端）施加合适的压力。,"Apply firm pressure to the branches over the acromial sites using your index fingers along the sides of the branches, not just at the tips."
8501,这些实验的结果可从多个方面来分析。,The data from these kinds of experiments can be analysed in several ways.
8501,首先，运动时总的消耗氧气量可以从运动开始到吸氧量恢复到运动前水平这段时间内的氧气摄取量的总和计算出来。,"First, the total, 0 2 cost of exercise can be determined by integrating the V02 with respect to time from the onset of exercise to the return of the Vo2 to pre-exercise values."
8501,而且，自行车测功器能精确计算实际做了多少功，吸氧量可以用所做的外功数值加以校正（即ml O^J-1)。,"Moreover, since cycle ergometiy permits a precise assessment of the actual work being performed, the 0 2 cost can be normalized to the external work performed (e."
8501,这就使得研究人员可以对儿童和成年人的吸氧量进行比较。,g.ml 0 2 -J This allows the investigator to compare 0 2 costs in children and adults.
8502,羟磷灰石晶体的抗压能力相当强，但是弹性相对差，而抗张力大的胶原蛋白纤维的强度却相对低，但是弹性高。,"The compression-resisting hydroxyapatite crystals have a relatively high strength but relatively low' elasticity, while the tension-resisting collagen fibres have a relatively low strength but high elasticity."
8502,它们结合后的强度却比各自的强度大 (Evans，1973)。,"The composite material is stronger than either constituent by itself (Evans, 1973)."
8502,骨骼的抗张力强度等于生铁，而重量却比生铁轻3倍并且更加柔韧 (Aycenzi & Bell，1971)。,"Bone has a tensile strength equal to cast iron, although it is three times lighter and very much more flexible (Ascenzi & Bell, 1971)."
8503,在对抗性项目中，增加肌肉重量和力量可减少某些急性损伤的发生（Cahill & Griffith，1978)。,"In contact sports, increased muscle mass and strength seem to reduce the occurrence of certain acute injuries (Cahill & Griffith, 1978)."
8503,在网球、游泳等个人项目中，加强上肢肌肉力量可减少肩部损伤的发生（Kibler et al.，1992)。,"In individual sports such as tennis and swimming, upper body strengthening is thought to reduce injuries to the shoulder (Kibler et al., 1992)."
8503,措抗肌（如股四头肌和胭绳肌）间的力量平衡，对于预防损伤也非常重要。,"The proper balance between the strengths of antagonist muscle groups, such as the quadriceps and hamstrings, may be important in the prevention of injury."
8504,接下来，进行以节奏为重点的30秒跑步训练。,"Next, perform four 30-second runs with an emphasis on cadence."
8504,用一个便携的节拍器，设定节奏为每分钟94下，记录每一次左脚踏中节奏的次数。,"Using a portable metronome set at 94 beeps per minute, time each pull of your left foot with the beep."
8504,每次跑步练习后休息1分钟。,Rest 1 minute after each run.
8504,之后再次重复整组练习。,Then do the whole set a second time.
8505,前言应该对于为何从事本研究的理由，提供一个全面的概述。突显一些重要研究已发现暴露与结果间的关系（或无此关系），以及解释为何这项健康议题值得关注。,"The introduction should provide a global overview of the rationale for the study, highlighting major research that has shown associations (or lack of associations) between the exposure and outcomes and explaining why this health concern is worthy of study."
8505,研究的理由中应该也要说明身体活动与这项健康议题间的生理机转。,The rationale should also address the biological mechanism for the association between the physical activity anda health outcome.
8506,最后，还需要进一步研究临床使用的各种方法的准确性和精度。,"Finally, additional research is needed to further define the accuracy and precision of clinical methods."
8506,这些方法必须在各种族和人种的样本中进行验证。,Such methods need to be validated in diverse racial/ethnic samples.
8506,至今为止，除了白色人种外的数据是十分有限的，并且验证的形式大多只限于使用二-成分密度测量模型（two- component densitometric model)。,"To date, few data are available for samples other than white Caucasians and the form of validation has been mostly restricted to using the two-component densitometric model."
8507,药球投射这项练习可帮助改善灵活性、协调性和持久度。,"Wall Ball This exercise is a metabolic firestorm that develops mobility, coordination, and stamina."
8507,双手在下方拖住药球，使药球位于下巴下方、胸部上方。,Place your hands underneath a medicine ball and center it beneath your chin and against your chest.
8507,像做颈前深蹲一样下蹲，腹股沟（髋部折痕）保持在膝盖水平面以下，然后用躯干发力起身，顺势推起药球。,"Drop down as if performing a front squat, with your hip crease passing beneath the plane of your knees, then explode upward, powering the ball with the momentum generated by your trunk."
8507,完全展开身体后，将药球推向空中，瞄准建筑或墙壁的标记位置，一般是离地面3米的高度。,"After full extension, press the ball into the air, shooting for a mark on a building or wall, 10 feet above the ground."
8507,接住回弹下落的药球，按照同样的路径回到深蹲的位置，这样视为完成一次动作。重复此动作。,Catch the ball on the rebound and retrace the same pathway back to the bottom of the squat for 1 rep. Repeat.
8508,体内的入侵者被巨噬细胞吞下并处理掉，巨噬细胞送出的化学信息（细胞活类素）吸引着别的白血球。,An invader into the body is ingested and processed by macrophages that send chemical messages (cytokines) that attract other white blood cells.
8508,（这种细胞分裂素有的时候会引起发烧、头疼和肌肉疼。,"(The cytokines can sometimes also cause fever, headache； and muscle pain.)"
8508,"）做出反应的白细胞紧贴着巨噬细胞以获取更多关于人侵细菌的信息,并生成一种特殊的防御机制一把T细胞和B细胞召集到被感染区。",Responding white cells attach to the macrophage so they can learn more about the invaders and develop specialized defense mechanisms—in the form of calling T cells and B cells to the area.
8508,T细胞直接杀死人侵细菌或者帮助调整免疫系统的反应。,The T cells directly kill the invader or help coordinate the immune response.
8508,B细胞制造抗体像子弹一样摧毁人侵细菌。,The B cells create antibodies that act like bullets to destroy the invaders.
8508,当他们完成任务，多余的白细胞将会杀死它们自己 (细胞自杀机制），以使它们不会误杀我们自身健康的细胞，造成自体免疫们疾病。,"When done, the excess white blood cells kill themselves (apoptosis) so that they won't kill our own healthy cells by mistake and cause an autoimmune disease."
8509,再说，这些测量方法通常被严格地用作录取研究所的标准。,"Still, these measures are often used rigorously as the criterion for admission to academic programs."
8509,当然 ，使用多元预测模型可以大幅改善对学业成就的预估。,"Of course, the use of multiple predictors can greatly improve the estimate for success."
8509,决定系数也可以用来比较相关系数的大小。,The sizes of correlations can also be compared using the coefficient of determination.
8509,相关系数为 .90 并不是相关系数为.3 0 的三倍高，而是九倍高(.302 =.09’或9%；和.902=.81，或81%)。,"A correlation of .90 is not three times larger than a correlation of .30; it is nine times larger (.302 = .09, or 9%, and .902 = .81, or 81%)."
8510,许多人用治疗的方法来区分细菌和病毒：细菌用抗生素治疗，病毒却不用。其实并非完全这样。对于艾滋病来说有许多抗病毒治疗方法。,Many people distinguish between bacteria and viruses by treatment: bacteria respond to treatment with antibiotics; viruses don't.But that s not entirely true—there are many antiviral medications for AIDS.
8510,这两种有机体的最主要区别跟它们的结构、大小和功能有关。,"The main differences between the two types of organism have to do with their structure, size, and function."
8511,当然了，你的免疫系统能够消灭掉大多数的癌细胞，那么，一个首要的逻辑性问题就出现了：你的身体干吗不叫免疫系统去消灭所有不受欢迎的细胞？,"Naturally, our immune system fights off most cancerous cells.So the logical first question is: Why wouldn't your body just call on the immune system to fight unwanted cells?"
8511,问得好。,Good question.
8511,实际上，你的免疫系统的确介入了，并且消灭掉了许多看起来模样怪异的细胞，即那些有可能造成癌症的细胞。,"In fact, your immune system does come in—and kills off many odd-looking cells, cells that have the potential to form cancer."
8511,这也就是为什么在抗癌方法中，多吃富含抗氧化剂和维生素D的食物通常会加强你的免疫系统的缘故。,That's why cancer-prevention measures like antioxidant-rich foods and vitamin D often work by strengthening your immune response.
8512,"不论何时,只要满足前述假定，母数统计通常被认为具有较高的考验力，虽然这个议题仍有些争议。","Whenever the assumptions are met, parametric statistics are often said to have more power, although there is some debate on this issue."
8512,较高的考验力代表了拒绝错误虚无假设的机率也增加。,Having more power increases the chances of rejecting a false null hypothesis.
8512,你往往会假定自己的资料满足使用母数考验应具备的三个条件，而这样的假定可以藉由偏态(skewness)和峰度(kurtosis)的估计值来检验,You frequently assume that the three criteria for use of parametric statistics are met.The assumptions can be tested by using estimates of skewness and kurtosis.
8513,Thomas Huxley，一位推广达尔文进化论的有名英国科学家，写道，科学充其量也只是常识而已。,"Thomas Huxley, a famous British scientist who promoted Darwin’s theory of evolution, wrote that science is simply common sense at its best."
8513,但是，科学之所以有其今日之地位，在于科学的发现大部分都是正确的，以及找出在哪些时候发现是不正确的。,"However, the status science holds is based on findings being correct most of the time as well as finding the instances in which reported findings are not correct."
8513,科学是系统性的，如果你跟我在同一时间甚或间隔二年的时间进行相同的研究，我们应该得到相同的答案。,"Science is systematic; if you and I do the same experiment at the same time or two years apart, we should get the same answer."
8514,可信性被用来决定研究是否具一定水准。,Trustworthiness is used to determine whether the study was competent.
8514,伦理问题，也就是研究如何进行的相关议题（例如确实性、可转换性、可靠性、可确认性），在决定可信性时扮演重要的角色。,"Ethical issues are important in determining trustworthiness, as are issues related to how the study was conducted (i.e., credibility, transferability, dependability, confirmability)."
8514,资料搜集与分析的过程中，我们会运用许多方法来提升资料与结论的品质，包括延长相处时间、回首来时路、丰富、深度描绘、研究偏见的厘清、三角检证、负面案例检证、成员检证与对同侪简报。,"Many techniques are used during data collection and analysis to enhance the quality of the data and the conclusions.Among these are prolonged engagement, keeping an audit trail, providing a thick and rich description, clarifying researcher bias, triangulation, negative case checking, member checking, and peer debriefing."
8514,在单一研究中并非所有方法都会用到，但提升读者对于结论的信心而使用大部分方法是很常见的，也可提升将研究结果移转到其他情境的信心。,"Not all of these can be used in one study, but using most or many is common to enhance the faith that readers can place in the conclusions and the transferability to other settings."
8515,这是一种类黄酮化合物，常见于红酒中。它似乎可以减小线粒体中基因的老化程度。线粒体是细胞的“发电站”。,This is a flavonoid found in red wine that seems to decrease the aging of the DNA in mitochondria—the cell's energy plant.
8515,这种类黄酮化合物起到解毒剂的作用，有助于抵抗动脉和免疫系统的老化。,"Those flavonoids act as an antioxidant, which helps reduce aging of the arteries and the immune system."
8515,红酒的这方面功效特别强，因为葡萄皮中含有白藜芦醇，而红酒与葡萄皮接触的时间长于葡萄酒（正因为此，酒是红色的）。,"Red wine especially has this benefit because it's the grape's skin that contains resveratrol, and red wine has been in contact with the skin of the grape for a longer time than has white wine (which is why it's red)."
8516,对体育运动史学者来说，有益的是新科技使得原始资料更容易取得。,One consideration that bodes well for the sport historian is the greater ease of access to prim ary sources created by new technologies.
8516,Cox和Salter(1998)进一步解释：“科技消弭了体育运动史学者在资料搜集上的不熟练、重复冗赘与耗时，让他们更专心于研究的核心——分析、综整、理论化以及资讯联系。”,"As Cox and Salter (1998) explained: “Technology will release the sport historian from unskilled, repetitive, time-consuming tasks, allow him or her to concentrate on the core activities of a sport historian— analysis, synthesizing, theorizing, and communicating information” ."
8517,"不考虑年龄和性别，肌肉横截面积标准化后的儿童和青年的平均肌肉特异性张力为33 N•cm-2,这个数值比伊卡和藤永(1968)计算出的低。","When normalized for muscle CSA, the mean specific tension of the muscle was 33 N.cm -2 for the children and young adults irrespective of age and sex.This value is lower than that found by Ikai and Fukun uga (1968)."
8517,戴维斯并未对此差别进行解释。,The discrepancy is not discussed by Davies.
8517,伊卡和藤永测量的是手臂的屈肌力量，而戴维斯测量的是小腿三头肌。,Ikai and Fukunuga measured strength in the arm flexors and Davies the triceps surae muscle.
8517,差异可能就是由此产生的，还可能是测量最大自主收缩力量和肌肉横截面积的方法上的差异引起的。,"The discrepancy may be due to this, and/or to methodological differences in the assessment of either maximal voluntary force or CSA of the muscles involved."
8518,自行车功率计必须适合儿童的身体尺寸（车蹬曲柄长度，车架，扶把和车座高度）。,"The cycle ergometer must be adapted to the body dimensions of the child (crank length, frame, handlebars and saddle height)."
8518,蹬车的转速（rev·min-1)用安在飞轮上的光电传感器进行监测，以便计算速度峰值和均值。,"The number of pedal revolutions (rev • min- 1 ) is measured by optical sensor at the flywheel, which computes peak or mean velocities."
8518,力-速度试验的结果取决于采用的方案。,The results of the force—velocity test depend on the protocol.
8519,血液类癌症，比如白血病就不是通常意义上的肿瘤，而是在骨髓中所积累的不正常的白细胞。它们聚集在一起，使得健康的白细胞和红细胞瀕临饿死，即使你的身体无法保证不被感染，也不能输送你所需要的氧。,"Blood-borne cancers such as leukemia are not like tumors in the usual sense.Instead, abnormal white blood cells accumulate in bone marrow and crowd or starve out healthy white and red blood cells-making your body unable to protect itself against infection and unable to deliver as much oxygen as you need."
8519,这些与血液有关的癌症，可以摧毀血液中的精髓和淋巴结，还能摧毀你赖以生存的其他细胞，直到你的血液中不再含有健康的细咆而完全 由癌细咆构成。,"These blood-type cancers can destroy blood marrow and lymph nodes, and they destroy other cells that you need to live—up until the point that your blood marrow no longer contains healthy cells but consists completely of cancerous cells."
8520,卵巢释放出的一个卵子被输卵管抓住。,The ovary releases an egg that is grabbed by the Fallopian tube.
8520,一巧卵子与输卵符失之交臂或留在输卵管里，就会发生宫外孕。,"If the egg misses this tube or stays in it, ectopic pregnancy can occur."
8520,当卵子穿过输卵管，向子宫运动时，为f争取与卵子结合，精子之间会发生激烈的生死竞争，如果精子数靖少或活性低（怠惰不前），都有可能失败。,"As the egg passes toward the uterus, sperm try to fertilize the egg in a savage competition for survival, but low sperm count or motility (lazy sperm) can limit their success."
8521,针对大强度训练的青少年的横向研究表明，运动员的月经周期长度与对照组没有区别，而黄体期不足、黄体期缩短和无排卵却比较普遍。,"Cross-sectional studies in intensively training adolescents have revealed that menstrual cycle lengths are not different from controls, whereas luteal phase insufficiency, short luteal phase and anovulation are much more common in young athletes."
8521,有迹象表明（Mare et al.，1986)，不同类型的活动会引起不同的激素反应，虽然选择活动的标准无法加以排除。,"There is an indication (Marx et al., 1986) that different types of activity evoke different hormonal responses, although selection criteria cannot be excluded."
8521,高强度训练的青少年或年轻女子的雌二醇、黄体酮和卵泡刺激激素水平都是毫无例外地降低，然而LH水平或与对照组持平或高于对照组。,"Oestradiol, progesterone and FSH levels have been consistently lower in intensively training adolescents or young women, whereas LH levels are either not different or higher than in controls."
8522,利迪亚德的训练方法使受训跑者在1960年奥林匹克运动会上获得了6 枚金牌，随即开启了利迪亚德时代。,Lydiard’s method won his runners six gold medals in the 1960 Olympics and ignited what would become the Lydiard era.
8522,在接下来的几十年时间，利迪亚德又在其他国家推广他的训练方式，如芬兰、日本、墨西哥等，而这些国家都培养出了马拉松冠军。,"He spent the following decades establishing his philosophy in countries such as Finland, Japan, and Mexico, each of which had its day as a world-beater."
8522,利迪亚德所到之处，金牌随之而来。,"Where Lydiard went, gold medals followed."
8522,因此在1989年，26岁的我决定挑战马拉松时，自然而然地选择用利迪亚德的训练方式进行练习。,"So in 1989, at age 26, when I decided to try a marathon, I naturally decided to train the Lydiard way."
8523,传媒化的信息（例如新闻媒体报道） 并非事物的客观呈现。,"Mediated messages (e.g., news media coverage) are not objective accounts of events."
8523,相反地，媒体利用特定的阐释来误导他人（Fiske，1996)。,"Instead, the media privilege certain interpretations while simultaneously discouraging others (Fiske, 1996)."
8523,"换句话说，那些包含在故事里的信息，更重要的是如何帮助“框架”建构一个事件给读者或是观众的（Fiske, 1996)。","In other words, what is included in the story, and more importantly, how it is discussed help ""frame"" an event for the reader or viewer (Fiske, 1996)."
8524,没有一种方法能治疗所有的癌症。,There's no one way to treat all cancers.
8524,有些癌症需要手术，而其他一些癌症却最好用放射治疗、化疗，或者放疗与化疗相结合。,"Some cancers require surgery, while others are best treated with radiation, chemotherapy, or some combination of all of them."
8524,癌症并不像心脏病发作，心脏病发作起来就如同房子着了火或是遭了电击，癌症是一种缓慢发展的过程，就像白蚁、霉菌，或是地基中的一条裂缝，它们会最终摧毀你的房子。,"Unlike a heart attack, which is similar to a fire or lightning strike to your home, cancer is more of a slow-growing problem—termites, mold, a crack in the foundation that can eventually destroy your home."
8525,镁在帮助调节新陈代谢中起着基本的功效。它能够通过扩张血管以降低血压。,"Magnesium, essential for helping regulate metabolism, helps lower blood pressure by dilating arteries."
8525,吃富含镁的食物——女性需要400毫克，男性需要333毫克，能使你年轻几乎1岁。,"Eating a magnesium-rich diet—400 milligrams for women, 333 milligrams for men—can make you nearly one year younger."
8525,全麦面包和谷类中通常含有镁，而在一份大豆和菜豆中则含有100毫克的镁。大多数坚果每份含有100到300毫克的钾。,"It's usually found in whole-grain breads and cereals, while soybeans and lima beans contain 100 milligrams perserving and most nuts contain 100 to 300 milligrams per serving."
8525,鳄梨、甜菜、葡萄干和大枣中也含有镁。,"Avocados, beets, raisins, and dates also contain magnesium."
8526,这些物质对免疫系统是有益处的，它们同时也有利于防止白内障的发生。,"They've been shown to be helpful for your immune system, but they're also helpful for protecting against cataracts."
8526,翻翻第10章看一看那些列出的含有非凡功用的类黄酮的食物。,See Chapter 10 for a list of the foods that contain powerful flavonoids.
8526,许多水果和蔬菜中含有维生素C和生物类黄酮。,"Many fruits and vegetables contain C and bioflavonoids,."
8527,交友、运动、冥想和参加群体活动都能给生活藏压，对保持年轻产生重大影响。,"You can have a major impact on your youth by reducing stress in your life with friendships, exercise, meditation, and group affiliation."
8527,如果说那些重大生活变故能减寿32年，这些方法则能争回30年。,"In fact, doing so will give back thirty of the thirty-two years that major life events can take away."
8527,我敢善欢的两种减压方法是笑和冥想。,Two of our favorite stress reducers are laughing and meditating.
8527,笑能缓解焦虑、压力和紧张，让人年轻1.7岁至8岁。,"Laughing, which reduces anxity, tension, and stress, can make you between 1.7 and 8 years younger."
8527,冥想有很多好处，有助于维持脑细胞正常工作，保护弓记忆有关的机能。而冥想减压的特性有助于防治抑郁症和焦虑这样的健康问题。,"With meditation, there's a multiple payoff.Meditation helps maintain your brain cells and preserve memory-related functions, and the stress-reduction component of meditation helps prevent such conditions as depression and anxiety disorder."
8528,上述使用于乱数表的系统方法并不是唯一的一种，你可以使用任何系统性的方法来读取表格。,The system used in the random numbers table is not the only one.You can use any systematic way of going through the table.
8528,当然，使用乱数表主要的目的是随机地选取样本，以便能代表较大的母群体，也就是说，在样本中的发现可以被推论至较大的群体上。,"Of course, the purpose of all this is to select a sample randomly so that it represents the larger population; that is, the findings in the sample can be inferred back to the larger population."
8528,从统计的观点來说，推论是指在样本中发现的特性、关联性或差异性可能也会出现在这些样本来源的母群体中。,"From a statistical viewpoint, inference means that a characteristic, relationship, or difference found in the sample is likely also to be present in the population from which the sample was selected."
8529,尼古丁是头号毒品，这主要是因为它对人体各部分产生的生理效应。,Nicotine is a leader in toxicity—especially because of its physiological effect on the rest of the body.
8529,成瘾本身不仅体现在对药物的心理依赖，还会表现为生理依赖。人脑告诉身体需要尼古丁，以防止良好的感觉消失。尼古丁令脑部产生愉悦感，进而感到放松，以此发挥效力。,"The addiction itself is manifested not only in an emotional need for the drug but also in a physical need; your brain tells your body it needs nicotine to prevent the symptoms of withdrawal One of the ways it works is by creating pleasure in the brain, causing a feeling of relaxation."
8529,经过一段时日后，尼古丁让脑部不再主动提供产生愉悦感的化学物质， 人会想要摄入更多的尼古丁，让它带来更多美好的感觉。,"Over time, nicotine keeps your brain from supplying these chemicals that create these good feelings, and you end up craving more nicotine and the feeling it produces."
8530,当一名儿童被怀疑有心律失常时，必须详细了解他的病史。,"When a child is suspected of having a dysrhythmia, a thorough history should be obtained."
8530,要询问的问题包括发作的频率、强度和数量以及每天发作的时间。,"Questions should be asked regarding the frequency, intensity and number of episodes, as well as the time of day that the epiodes occur."
8530,通常，心率失常是与运动、药物治疗、咖啡因的摄入或使用（或滥用）药物有关。,"Often dysrhythmias are associated with exercise, medications, caffeine intake or drug use and/or abuse."
8530,心律失常伴随的症状包括头痛、恶心、呕吐、视力丧失、昏厥或昏厥前期。,"Associated symptoms include headache, nausea, vomiting, loss of vision, syncope or near syncope."
8531,在儿童中期（6〜10岁），男女合校会组织多种体育活动。,Many youth sports are offered on a coeducational basis during middle childhood (about 6—10 years).
8531,某些运动允许男孩与女孩共同参加，直至12岁，但多数运动均有性别限制。,"Some sports permit coeducational participation up to about 12 years of age, but subsequently participation in the majority of youth sports is sex-limited."
8531,"12-13岁期间是男女性成熟阶段，与性别相关的体型、力量及部分技术存在很大差异（Malina & Bouchard, 1991)。","It is at about 12—13 years of age that sex differences in maturational timing and related sex differences in size and strength, and to a lesser extent skill, become more pronounced (Malina & Bouchard, 1991)."
8531,因此，在组织男女混合参加的接触性或冲撞性体育活动时应予以特别关注。,"Hence, coeducational participation in contact and collision sports should be advised with caution."
8532,在图40.1中，显示了代表比值标准和线性回归的两条曲线。,The lines which represent the ratio standard and linear regression are indicated in Fig. 40.
8532,"这些数据的皮尔逊积矩相关系数（或“皮尔森积差相关系数”）为0.694(P=0.002),而vx/vy是1.266,显然，不符合坦纳的特殊情况。",1. Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient for these data was 0.694 (P = 0.002) whereas vx/vy was 1.266; clearly Tanner's special circumstance was not satisfied.
8532,如果比值标准用于诊断目的，当与“实际”的关系不和时，数据扭曲是不言自明的。,"If the ratio standard was to be used against which indi­ viduals were to be compared for diagnostic purposes, the distortion is self-evident when set against the 'true' relationship."
8533,要说明一组数据分布的情形，另一个有效方法是茎叶图（stem-and-leaf display) 。,Another effective way to provide information about the distribution of a set of data is called a stem-and-leaf display.
8533,它的呈现方式类似于分组频率分布，但是讯息不会遗失。,"This representation is similar to a grouped frequency distribution, but no information is lost."
8533,图6.2b是同一组高尔夫数据范例的茎叶图。,Figure 6.2b provides a stem-and-leaf distribution of the same golf data.
8533,你可以看到每一位球员的真实平均成绩——其中11位球员被列在开头是70的这个分数列中。,You can observe each player’s actual scoring average——note that 11 players are listed by the first score of 70.
8533,往右边阅读，其中有3位球员的平均是70.0、3位球员是70.2、4位球员是70.3，还有1位球员是70.4。,"Reading to the right, 3 players average 70.0, 3 are at 70.2,4 are at 70.3, and 1 is at 70."
8533,当我们把区间从最低排到最高，旋转页面，你就能看到类似于直方图的图形。,"4. When the intervals are ordered from lowest to highest, you can turn the page on its side and see a type of graph similar to the histogram."
8533,这个方法能帮助你将分布的常态性可视化。,This method helps you visualize the normality of the distribution.
8534,控制肌肉收缩顺序的是脊髓本身。,Control of this sequence of muscle contractions lies in the spinal cord itself.
8534,我们知道这一点，是因为如果你除去七鳃鳗的大脑，然后电刺激它的脊髓，你仍然可以见到它协调的游泳动作。,"We know this because if you remove the lamprey’s brain and then electrically stimulate the spinal cord, you still witness coordinated swimming motion."
8534,而且，甚至是将 脊髓切成块，只留下两三个肌肉段，电刺激仍然可以引起剩下的肌肉做类似游泳的活动。,"And, if you go so far as to chop the spinal cord into pieces containing only two or three muscle segments, electrical stimulation still causes swimlike activity in what muscle still remains."
8535,由特殊细胞（称为起搏细胞）发出的电流，由心脏顶部开始向下流动，刺激心肌，将血液挤出，通过主动脉瓣膜。,Electricity from special cells (called pacemaker cells)—starting at the top of the heart and moving down——stimulates the heart muscle to wring the blood out through the aortic valve.
8535,这就像拧湿毛—样，把水扔出来。,
8535,从心脏中流出的血液自动注入主动脉，主动脉是人体最大的动脉血管，将富含氧气的血液输送到人体其他部分。,"The wave of blood that has been twisted out of the heart is ejected into the aorta itself, the body's largest artery, which carries oxygen*rich blood to the rest of the body."
8536,如前所述，青年运动员上肢应力性骨折并不常见，但对从事投掷项目或上肢反复受到冲击的年轻运动员应该加以重视。,"As noted above, stress fractures of the upper extremity in young athletes are relatively uncommon but certainly are to be suspected in the throwing sports or in sports involving repetitive impacting of the upper extremity."
8536,投掷运动员发生肱骨或前臂应力性骨折主要是上肢反复承受扭转应力所致。,Stress fractures of the humerus and forearm occurring in the throwing sports appear to be due to repetitive torsional stress of the upper extremity.
8536,"对于骺板未闭合的儿童运动员而言，此种应力可能位于骺板，并被称为“小联赛肩”(Little League shoulder) (Cahill et al.,1974)。","In the child athlete with open growth plates, this stress may be localized at the physeal plate and has been dubbed 'Little League shoulder' (Cahill et al., 1974)."
8537,如果能延长训练周期，效果会更好。,"If they can commit to a longer period, even better."
8537,我会在一开始进行大量的视频分析，以便他们理解我是随着他们能力的增长而增加训练量的。,I use video analysis a lot in the beginning so they can understand that I am progressing their volume along with their skill.
8537,我安排时长20-30分钟的热身阶段包括技巧动作复习、慢跑以及间歇训练，还要让他们不要丢弃所有的长跑练习，因为他们仍然需要在跑道上进行至少1小时的跑步练习。,"Also, spending 20 to 30 minutes on rotating drills and running as a warm-up, plus the interval portion, helps them not miss all of those long runs because they are still spending up to an hour on the track."
8538,V字举腿在健身房里极为罕见。,V raises are very rarely seen in gyms.
8538,除了偶尔有一些武术家表演过V字举腿（李小龙的最爱之一），通常只有高手级的体操运动员才能做到这种动作。,You might witness the occasional expert martial artist performing them—they were a favorite of Bruce Lee—but they are usually the province of advanced gymnasts.
8538,它需要训练者经过数年、认真的、循序渐进的身体中段训练，尤其要专心于最难、最有成效的技巧，方可培养出做该动作所需的肌肉力量、神经力量、协调力与柔韧性。,"They require a level of muscular strength, nervous power, coordination and flexibility that can only be cultivated through years of serious, progressive midsection work, specializing in only the hardest, most productive training techniques."
8539,研究显示，学校提供的午餐一般要比从家里带去的午餐有更高的营养价值。,Studies have shown that the school lunch is usually more nutritious than a lunch brought from home.
8539,这是因为从家里带去的午餐一般品种较少，仅仅包含几种偏爱的食物。,This is because box lunches typically contain less variety and include only favourite foods.
8539,此外，从家里带去的午餐仅限于容易携带、无需加热或冷冻的食物。,"In addition, they are limited to foods that travel well and do not require heating or refrigeration."
8539,即使家里做的是营养餐，家长也不可能知道哪些被孩子吃了，哪些被交换了或者被扔掉了。,"Even if a nutritious lunch is packed at home, the parent does not necessarily know what portion is eaten, traded or thrown away."
8540,这些是与琼斯有关的，因为关于她的具体化框架包含性别的、种族的以及异性恋的叙事。,"This is relevant for Jones, as her framing materialized through gendered, racialized, and heterosexualized narratives."
8540,事实上，作为一个美丽的、女性的、异性恋的美国田径运动救世主，她早期的商业化力量解释了为什么人们没有办法质疑她事业初期超常的运动能力及过失。,"Indeed, the power of her initial commodification as the beautiful, feminine, heterosexual savior of U.S. track and field accounts for widespread failure to question her exceptional athleticism and culpability early in her career."
8540,这种商业化也使琼斯的谎言和明显的欺骗行为变得不可饶恕，而且违背了建构她所使用的女性和女性英雄式的通常话语。,"This commodification also rendered her lies and apparent cheating unforgiveable, violatingthe common discourses of femininity and female heroic used to construct Jones."
8541,在社区介入，系将整个社区进行随机分派 并接受多重处方，包含大众传媒活动、以学校为本位的方案、购买行为介入(如在零售店贴上标示，以标明含有较低饱和脂肪量的食物品牌 )，以及相关活动等型式。,"In community trials, whole communities are randomized to receive multiple treatments in the form of mass media campaigns, school-based programs, point of purchase interventions (e.g., posting signs in grocery stores indicating brands of food that have less saturated fat), and related activities."
8541,对照组社区则未接受介 入 ，但扮演著呈现实验过程中在社区自然发生的那些改变所产生的效果。,The comparison communities do not receive the intervention but serve to show the effect of naturally occurring changes in community behaviors over time.
8541,资料收集与分 析包含:监测介入方案依预期进行的程度以及介入在社区行为上的效果(过程评估)、在个人层次之行为与健康的改变(个人评估)，以及介入造成环境的改变(社区层次指标评估)。,"Data collection and analysis include monitoring the extent to which an intervention is implemented as intended and the effects of the intervention on community behaviors (process evaluation), individual-level changes in behavior and health outcomes (individual evaluation), and changes in the environment influenced by the intervention (community-level indicator evaluation)."
8542,身体成分测量的另外一个用途是为取得运动训练的最佳效果提供脂肪与去脂身体成分合适比例的信息，以及为确定身体素质状态提供信息。,Another use of body composition measurement is to provide information about appropriate ratios of fat and FFB for optimizing physical performance related to sports and for determination of physical fitness status.
8542,"我们已经十分了解这些成分对身体运动能力的影响（Boileau et al., 1989)。","The influence of these components on physical performance is well documented (Boileau et al., 1989)."
8542,具体说，研究已经证实，需要垂直和水平移动体重，尤其是在需要耐力性的身体工作时，身体脂肪重量与工作能力之间存在着负相关。,"Specifically, research has demonstrated an inverse relationship between body fat and performance in physical tasks requiring either vertical or horizontal displacement of body weight, and particularly in endurance performance."
8543,一旦脊柱受到过大扭力， 椎间盘就会被挤出，这就造成了椎间盘突出，就好比用力压面圈，果冻会被挤出一样。,"A bulging or herniated disc happens when too much torque is put on the spine and the disc bulges out, like pinching the doughnut so the jelly oozes out."
8543,如果椎间盘突出的位置靠近神经，就会导致通向四肢的神经发炎。正因为这个原因，受到压迫的神经通常会让人四肢疼痛，而大多不会直接影响到脖子和背部。,"If that occurs close to a nerve, that leads to inflammation of your nerves leading down to your legs and arms, which is why a pinched nerve hurts down the legs or arms more than directly in the neck or back."
8544,听觉和视觉刺激的反应时在晚上的早些时候会达到最大，这与核心体温达到峰值是一致的。,"Reaction time to auditory or visual stimuli is greatest in the early evening hours, coinciding with the time of peak core temperature."
8544,如前所述，这可能反映了神经传导速度会随体温升髙而加快。,"As noted previously, this may reflect the direct effect of increased velocity of nerve conduction from a rise in body temperature."
8544,然而，要得到更快的反应，是要以准确性的消耗为代价的，因为准确性在晚上的早些时候是最糟糕的，因此这个现象很有趣。,"It is interesting, though, that faster reactions are apparently gained at the expense of accuracy, which is worse in the early evening."
8545,从生理学上看，我们认为抑郁症是由脑内化学物质含量不平衡而产生的，即负责在脑部发送接受信息的化学物质含量反常。抑郁症患者体内的肾上腺皮质激素含量通常偏低。,"Physiologically, we believe depression stems from chemical imbalances in the brain—meaning that you may have abnormal levels of the chemicals that your nervous system uses to send signals to and from the brain."
8545,肾上腺皮质激素是一种分布在脑内的愉悦激素，具体说来，抑郁症病人的神经细胞承载肾上腺皮质激素时会出现问题。,"People with depression generally have low levels of serotonin, a feel-good hormone, in their brains—specifically, their neurons have trouble loading serotonin."
8546,狂食行为通常包括摄入高热量的食物(糖果），常常不引人注意或秘密地进食。,"The eating binge typically includes high caloric density foods (sweets), usually eaten incon­ spicuously or secretly."
8546,通过呕吐来缓解腹部不适，但患者能继续狂食行为。,
8546,,"By using vomiting to relieve abdominal discomfort, the individual can continue the binge."
8546,与神经性厌食症一样，神经性易饿症也是开始于青春期或成年早期。,"As with anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa begins in adolescence or in early adulthood."
8547,肾上腺也分泌降肾上腺素和肾上腺素。当你激动时，这两种物质的分泌水平就会上升。,"Your adrenal glands also produce norepinephrine and epinephrine, levels of which rise when you get excited."
8547,在正常的日常生活中，肾上腺素的水平维持在每毫升200至800毫微克（十亿分之一克）。,"In normal daily life, your levels of epinephrine hover between 200 to 800 nanograms per milliliter."
8548,"并非只有“胆结石""和“滚石”乐队这两种“石”会影响我们的生活。",Gallstones and the Rolling Stones aren't the only stones that can change your life.
8548,还有一种“石”会让你痛得昏过去，像橄榄球运动员被对手在肚子上猛顶一下一样。,The other is the one thatll make you keel over like a rugby player who's been kneed in the groin.
8548,尿液含水量过少，会形成小晶体，接着晶体会聚集形成结石，即肾结石。患者在排尿时，背部下侧和腰侧都会剧痛。,Kidney stones form when urine becomes so concentrated that small crystals and then stones are formed—creating intense pain in your lower back and side and when you urinate.
8548,肾结石的主要防治方法是把自己的身体当成一个空的游泳池，将池子装满水，让水冲出来，通过用水稀释结晶体的方法来防止其进一步形成结石。,"The main method of prevention is to treat your body like an empty swimming pool and flood it with water to flush it out, which inhibits the formation of the crystals by diluting them with water."
8549,外表可能具有欺骗性。,And appearances can be deceiving.
8549,轻度脑外伤的表象可能会对长期失忆严生重大影响。,What might seem to be minor head trauma can actually play a major role in long-term memory loss.
8549,尽管我们所说的脑外伤通常是指110万患脑震荡等严重损伤的人所遇到的健康问题，但是，头部受伤导致眼冒金星这种轻度问题也可能会在之后引发失忆。,"Though we usually associate brain trauma with the 1.1 million people who suffer concussions or worse, even seeing stars after a minor head injury can lead to later memory loss."
8550,后者也曾使政治领导人在国际访问中陷人尴尬。但也有专家不这么认为，所有在国际比赛中的运动员必须明白和调整由旅行引起 的生物节律障碍。,But some experts don’t think so.All athletes in international competition must understand and adjust for travel-induced interruptions of their biological rhythms.
8550,但时差是如何真正影响运动表现的？,But how much  does jet leg truly affect performance?
8550,没有人确切地知道。,No one knows for sure.
8550,本章将专门讨论这个问题。,"This  chapter is devoted to the question.Circadian rhythmsBy now, we should be convinced that we humans abound in timekeepers."
8550,,We’ve seen in the previous chapters that our internal clocks finely  tune the sequence of muscular innervation that permits locomotion.
8551,许多原因会使窗户不能发挥作用。比如窗户会破损，会起雾，会因为粉刷油漆而被迫关上，也可能因为一个垒球袭来而破碎，玻璃四处腾飞。,"Lots of things can make windows ineffective—they can break, they can fog up, they can be painted shut, they can come out on the losing end of a collision with a baseball."
8551,对眼睛来说，也有许多因素会扰乱视力，有些会造成视线模糊，有些则会造成视力完全被破坏。,"With your eyes, lots of things can tinker with the process of vision, too—some will fog them up and some will cause an all-out break."
8551,不论造成问题的原因是什么，我们一般都会想到长期视力问题的主要后果：失明。,"No matter what the cause of the problem, we usually think of the primary long-term effect of optical problem: blindness."
8552,图1.3总结了比利时男孩六种运动能力的每相距半年的增长速率。,Half-yearly velocities for six performance tasks in Belgian boys are summarized in Fig. 1.
8552,"平均而言, 静力性力量（手臂拉力）、爆发力（纵跳）和肌肉耐力（屈肘悬吊）的最大增长速度都发生在最大身高增长速度之后。","3. On the average, peak velocities in static strength (arm pull), explosive strength (vertical jump) and muscular endurance (bent arm hang) occur after PHV."
8552,这些运动能力在青春期的快速增长一般开始于最大身高增长速度之前1.5年，而在最大身高增长速度之后0.5-1年达到峰值。,The adolescent spurt in these characteristics appears to begin about 1.5 years prior to PHV and reach a peak 0.5—1 year after PHV.
8553,每天两次摄取100-500毫克的维生素C可以加强你的免疫系统。,Take 100 to 500 milligrams of vitamin C twice daily for boosting your immune system.
8553,除了柑橘类水果，维生素C还包含在浆果、绿色蔬菜以及番茄中。,"Besides cirtrus fruits, vitamin C is also in berries, green vegetables, and tomatoes."
8553,你也可以每天摄取400 国际单位的维生索E(与维生素C一起服用），因为维生素E可以减少有些癌症的发病率，你可以在谷物、坚果和植物油中找到维生素E。,"And you can also take 400 IU of vitamin E daily (take it with vitamin C), because it helps reduce the risk of certain cancers.You can find E in wheat germ, nuts, and vegetable oils."
8554,但是警察并没有在他的尸体里检测出类固醇类物质，当局最终提出怀疑称他长期服用类固醇随后采用了睾酮素来代替治疗——针对使用类固醇引起的缺陷的常规疗法——是这次谋杀自杀惨案的主因。,"No steroids were found in Benoit's body at the time of his death, and authorities eventually expressed doubt that his prolonged use of steroids and his subsequent testosterone replacement therapy—a common treatment for deficiencies caused by steroid use—were contributing factors to the murder-suicide."
8554,然而，医生却发现贝诺伊特在他的职业摔角生涯中遭受了多重的脑部冲击，这些冲击诱发了严重的脑损伤和早发性老年痴呆，与那些职业橄榄球运动员身上发现的类似。,"Instead, doctors found that the multiple concussions Benoit suffered during his wrestling career resulted in severe brain damage and early-onset dementia, similar to that found in professional football players."
8554,简而言之，独特的摔角技巧导致了贝诺伊特，这位最受尊敬的职业摔角选手之一的残酷死亡。,"In short, the very wrestling skills that made Benoit one of the most respected professional wrestlers contributed to his brutal demise."
8555,睡眠呼吸暂停综合征患者有几种治疗方案可以选择。最常用的是晚上戴呼吸道持续正压通气的鼾治疗面罩睡觉。,"People who suffer from sleep apnea can choose a number of treatment options, the most popular being a PAP mask that's worn at night."
8555,这种面罩看上去像普通的氧气面罩，与一台带管子的仪器相连，能够测量组织肿胀的程度，用外力推着空气通过肿大的组织，帮助患者轻松呼吸。,The mask—which looks like a traditional oxygen mask thats hooked up to a machine with tubes—gauges levels of the swollenness of tissue and pushes air past the swollen tissue so that you can breathe easier.
8556,由于需要推动体重的力的总量保持不变，所以随着时间的推移，每步需要更大的功率。,"Since the amount of force required to propel body mass stays constant, a greater rate of force over time is required for each step."
8556,所以，当步频增加时，不只是双腿交换的速度加快了，还有对抗地面的肌肉力量也上升了。,"So, it’s not just the speed of leg turnover that increases as stride frequency rises, but also the rate of muscle force produced against the ground."
8556,因此，随着CPG时钟速率的加快，神经系统必须发送信息到腿部肌肉以增加力量，即使它仅仅是步频的改变。,"Thus, as the rate of the CPG clock accelerates, the nervous system must transmit messages to the leg muscles to increase force as well, even if it is simply the stride frequency that is altered."
8557,"许多儿童不吃早餐（Lucas, 1993)。","Many children skip breakfast (Lucas, 1993)."
8557,"研究表明，与不吃早餐的儿童相比，吃早餐的儿童心态更好，学习成绩较好，解决问题的能力更强（Pollitt et al.，1981; Simeon & Grantham-McGregor, 1989)。","Some studies suggest that children who eat breakfast have a better attitude, school record and problem-solving ability compared to children who do not eat breakfast (Pollitt et al., 1981; Simeon & Grantham-McGregor, 1989)."
8557,此外，早餐可以补充因夜间空腹而耗竭的糖原，确保儿童下午训练有足够的能量储备。,"In addition, breakfast helps to replenish glycogen stores depleted during an overnight fast, to ensure that the child has adequate energy stores for afternoon training."
8557,重要的是，要鼓励儿童寻找自己喜爱的早餐食物，这些食物不一定必须是传统的食品。,It is important to encourage children to find foods they like to eat for breakfast.These do not need to be traditional foods.
8557,注重食物的构成而非社会传统，才是最好的策略。,"Food composition, not social tradition is the best strategy."
8557,早餐应该提供一天中1/4至1/3的营养素。,Breakfast should provide between a quarter to a third of the nutrients for the day.
8558,虽然范·米彻伦提出采用缺席运动时间这一指标能够准确地判断损伤的情况，但就青少年而言， 这一观点还有疑问。,"Although van Mechelen et al. (1987) stated that the length of sports absenteeism provides the most precise indication of the consequences of a sports injury to an athlete, this claim is questionable in regard to young athletes."
8558,运动员对疼痛的忍受程度、治疗的方法、父母与教练等诸多因素都会导致误差的产生。,"Bias can easily develop, induced by factors such as an individual's pain tolerance, type of treatment, parents and coach."
8558,缺席运动时间对于无组织的运动员而言，意义不大。,The time-loss definition of injury is not useful in studies which include non-organized sports.
8559,该计划中，六艺会在三天中练完，在一周内循环两次。,"It involves the Big Six performed over a three-day cycle, repeated twice over seven days."
8559,这套密集计划还给受虐狂增加了一些补充练习。,"To this dense routine, ancillary work is added for masochists."
8559,只有苦练体操一年以上、恢复能力超好的人才可尝试。,It should only be attempted by individuals with excellent recovery ability who have been in hard calisthenics training for over a year.
8559,每周至少需要空出六七个小时才能完成这套计划。,You’ll need at least six or seven hours free per week to finish this program.
8560,测量的频度取决于目的。,Frequency of measurement depends upon the objective.
8560,有些运动项目，每日的体重记录是训练日记的一个部分，因为个人体重的波动趋势是否符合比赛要求是人们最为关心的问题。,In some sports daily weight records are part of the training log since the individual pattern of fluctuations is of concern in meeting weigh-in requirements.
8560,一般而言，每周在特定的时间测量一次体重就能够进行满意的监测。,"Normally, weekly measurement of body weight at some designated time in the day provides adequate monitoring."
8560,"对体重的解释是要冒一定风险的，特别是如果个人或教练员对 “理想”体重目标的设定是不切合实际的时候更是如此（S.M. Garm,个人交流资料，1993)。","The interpretation of this data is fraught with hazards, especially if the individual or coach sets inappropriate goals about a presumed 'ideal' body weight (S.M. Garm, personal communication, 1993)."
8561,甲状腺位于贴近气管的地方，它在控制你的新陈代谢上能起到部分作用。,"The thyroid, which is plastered against the trachea (windpipe), partly regulates your metabolism."
8561,甲状腺机能亢进的腺体会分泌过多的激索使我们的身体亢奋，表现为心动过速、战栗恐惧、发质脆弱、睡眠不好、情绪易怒等等。,"A hyperthyroid gland secrets too much hormone and makes our body overative with fast heartbeats, tremors, brittle hair, sleeping troubles, and irritability."
8561,甲状腺机能低下的腺体会使身体新陈代谢过慢，导致体重增加、皮肤干燥、情绪沮丧、疲劳和怕冷等。,"A hypothyroid gland leaves the body with too-low metabolism, resulting in symptoms like weight gain, dry skin, depression, fatigue, and coldness."
8561,甲状腺还会集结成大的肿块，需要进一步的测定。,"The thyroid can also have nodules or large goiters, which need further evaluation."
8561,甲状腺上有四个小的副甲状腺，能够调节血液中和骨骼中的钙。,Four tiny parathyroid glands lie on the thyroid and regulate calcium in your blood and bones.
8562,更进一步说，我们可以看到在优良表现量表的测验中，最高分数组的学生，其运动行为没有被评定在普通以下的；相对的，也没有量表中，最低得分区间(0到9)的学生，其运动行为被评定高于不佳的。,"Further, none of the students with the top scores on the inventory were rated below average, and conversely, none of the students with the lowest inventory scores (0-9) were given ratings higher than poor."
8562,在这个例子中，我们使用预期表来 做为我们测验的同时效度的证据。,"In this example, we are using an expectancy table to provide evidence of the concurrent validity of our inventory."
8562,"有时预期表的讯息可被用于预测成功表现，例如以高中时期的性向测验(aptitude test) 得分来预测大学学业成绩平均(grade-point average,GPA) 在任何与效标效度有关的情况下，效标的方便性、 适切性、以及效标的敏感性，对任何可信的测量都是重要的议题。","Sometimes, expectancy table information can be used to predict success, such as grade point average in college from an aptitude test given in high school.As with all situations involving criterion validity, the availability and relevance of the criterion and its susceptibility to reliable measurement are key issues."
8563,如同任何的研究流程，统合分析需要挑选重要的问题进行研讨。,"Like any research procedure, meta-analvsis involves the selection of an important problem to address."
8563,但是，统合分析包含了典型文献回顾所没有的两大步骤。,"However, meta-analysis involves two steps lacking in the typical literature review paper."
8563,第一，被定义之方法学（definitive methodology) ，这里指的是关于文献分析的每个决定皆必须要报告。,"First, a definitive methodology is reported concerning the decisions in a literature analysis."
8563,"第二，不同的研究结果被量化至一标准的测度单位，称为效果量（effect size, ES ) ，进而让我们能够使用统计技术作为分析的工具。","Second, the results of various studies are quantified to a standard metric called effect size (ES) that allows the use of statistical techniques as a means of analysis."
8564,当你运动时，血液的褪黑素水平是怎样的呢？,What happens to blood-melatonin levels when you exercise?
8564,已有报道都是相矛盾的。,The reports have been conflicting.
8564,一项研究发现，血浆褪黑素水平在成年女性60min运动之后，会短暂升髙到至少2倍于平时水平，这与之前在男性中的发现是相似的。,One study found that that plasmamelatonin levels in adult females rose transiently at least twofold after 60 minutes of exercise.This is similar to previous findings in men.
8564,但是其他研究则报道，在完成20min运动的3h 后褪黑素浓度下降，或者在运动之后血液褪黑素水平根本没有变化。,"But others have described either a decline in melatonin concentration  3 hours after 20 minutes of exercise, or no changes in blood-melatonin levels at all after sessions of exercise."
8565,全身屈摇摆可以增强躯干力量和重心稳定性，即使在长跑最后的疲惫阶段，跑者仍然可以保持正确的姿势。,"Hollow rock develops trunk strength and midline stabilization, which allows runners to hold good form even when they are fatigued at the end of a long race."
8565,平躺于地面上，双臂伸直，在头部上方打开。,Lie faceup on the ground with arms reaching overhead.
8565,收紧肌肉——包括腹肌和臀肌——想象自己试图将肚脐固定到脊柱上。,Tighten up your muscles—including abs and glutes—and imagine that you’re trying to pin your belly button to your spine.
8565,你的目标姿势应该像一轮新月，即保持下背部紧贴地面，手臂和双腿抬离地面约30厘米的高度。,"You should be aiming to achieve a shape like a crescent moon, with your lower back flat on the ground and your arms and legs elevated about a foot off the ground."
8565,利用双腿的力量带动身体像摇椅一样摆动。,Now use your legs to kick and power a rocking-chair motion.
8566,虽然它们长得很快，但是它们却不是依靠自身生长的。,"While they grow quickly, they can't grow by themselves."
8566,就像植物生长需要水，孩子长大需要维生素一样，癌细胞也需要营养才能长大。,"Just as a plant needs water or a child needs vitamins, cancer cells need nutrients to grow."
8566,癌细胞最需要的就是能量。,The one thing that cancer cells want more then anything else is energy.
8566,如果癌细胞没了能量，它就会自己死掉，因为营养供应跟不上它们生长的速度。,"If the cells don't get it, then they actually kill themselves off because they'd outgrow their energy supply."
8567,"每天摄取500亳克的维生素C,每日摄取两次，将有助于加强你的免疫系统 (以便免疫系统能生产更多的弹药杀灭入侵者）。",Take 500 milligrams twice a day every day to boost your immune system (so it can produce more bullets to kill the invaders).
8567,所以你可以以补充剂的形式摄取，也可通过向橘子或其他柑橘类食物、百分百天然橘汁、西红柿汁、甜椒计等摄取。,"You can take it in supplement form, as well as through foods such as oranges and other citrus fruits,100 percent natural orange juice, tomatoes, and bel peppers."
8567,因为它能保持你的免疫系统和动脉年轻，维生素C能让你年轻1岁呢。,"Vitamin C, for all its power to keep your immune system and arteries young, can make you up to one year younger."
8568,沃尔夫氏定律同样适用于骨骼的密度。,Wolff's law also applies to the density of bone.
8568,大量的研究证实，运动员的骨骼矿物质密度（BMD）大于非运动员。,Numerous studies have observed higher BMD values in athletes compared to non­athletes.
8568,长期从事网球训练的运动员用力侧手臂的骨骼矿物质含量高于非用力侧手臂。,Lifetime tennis players have significantly greater bone mineral content in the dominant arm in contrast to the non-dominant arm.
8568,对有活动和没有活动人群的横向比较研究显示，骨骼矿物质密度与体力活动之间存在着正相关的关系。,Cross-sectional studies examining active and sedentary populations indicate a positive relationship between physical activity and BMD.
8569,有些作者认为若要使用费雪尔Z转换计算出相关系数的平均值，则必须先将四个相关系数之间设定为不具显著差异。,"Some authors declare that to average correlations by the Z-transformation technique, you must first establish that there are no significant differences among the four correlations."
8569,可以透过Z值加权的卡方检验( chi-square test)比较相关系数之间的差异(第10章将会介绍卡方检验)。,A comparison for differences could be made using a chi-square test of the weighted Z values (chi square is discussed in chapter 10).
8569,其他统计学家认为，只要相关系数的平均值不是以信赖区间进行设释(confidence interval) 要将相关系数进行平均是被允许的。,Other statisticians contend that averaging coefficients of correlation is permissible as long as the average correlation is not interpreted in terms of confidence intervals.
8570,一段时间以来，已注意到运动训练计划对年轻哮喘患者的良好作用。,The beneficial effects of exercise conditioning programmes in young patients with asthma have been noted for some time.
8570,这些好处有主观的和客观的表现。,These benefits have ranged from the very subjective including
8570,主观的包括：（1）参加活动的能力改善，包括学校、教会和运动活动；（2）被同龄人认可；（3）情绪低落情况减轻，并认识到疾病不一定是生活的全部；（4）哮鸣发作的程度减轻。,"(i) improved ability to participate in activities, including school and church programmes and sports;(ii) accept­ ance by peers;(iii) decrease in emotional upset, and recognition that sickness need not be a way of life; and(iv) decrease in the intensity of wheezing attacks; to the objective."
8571,"根据马绍尔(Marshall, 1 9 9 7 )的观点，当代名流是具有后现代性的一对孪生话语的高端呈现：新自由主义民主和消费资本主义。","According to Marshall (1997), the contemporary celebrity is an embodied exaltation of the twinned discourses of late modernity: neoliberal democracy and consumer capitalism."
8571,"诚然，西方的自由民主代表了一种政治系统，专注于 “个人的、私密的以及个体的” ( Marshall, 1997 , p.xiii)。","Indeed, Western liberal democracy represents a political system preoccupied with ""the personal, the intimate, and the individual"" (Marshall, 1997, p. xiii)."
8571,它包含了一个与消费资本主义同样的对于经济 (再)生产的唯我论体制。,It incorporates an equally solipsistic regime of economic (re)production (consumer capitalism).
8571,两者都为超级个体化(商业电视)的超高技术所培育。,Both are nurtured by the supreme technology of hyper-individualization (commercial television).
8572,人体高效的消化系统能从食物中提取出最多的能量。,Our remarkably efficient digestive system extracts the most calories possible.
8572,这一过程从口腔中的颞下颌关节开始。在咀嚼食物时，颞下颌关节会松开，让咬肌能更有力地挤压食物。,The process starts in the mouth with a temporomandibular jaw (TMJ) joint that purposely dislocates during chewing in order to allow the masseter muscle to compress food more forcefully.
8572,牙齿像拼图积木一样紧紧相合，确保没有漏嚼食物，令消化充分。,The teeth fit together like puzzle pieces to ensure that no morsel is left unchewed and underdigested.
8572,经常咬紧牙关或颌骨太紧，往往造成颞下颌关节疼痛和头痛。,Clenching teeth and having a tight jaw often cause TMJ pain and headaches.
8573,小腿内侧（medial calf)。,Medial calf.
8573,在估计最大围度的水平上用拇指和食指将小腿内侧的皮褶捏起，距手指lcm处的夹子距离。,The caliper distance when applied 1 cm distal to the left thumb and index finger raising a vertical fold on the medial right calf at the estimated greatest circumference.
8573,当受试者将脚放在盒子上、膝关节屈曲90°时，很容易测量该处的皮褶厚度。,This is easiest to obtain when the subject's leg is flexed to an angle of 90° at the knee by placing the foot on a box.
8574,就困难度而言，资料的收集算是最为容易的步骤，因为就大部分的情况都只是例行作业，但是，方法的规则是最为困难的步骤之一。,"In terms of difficulty, gathering data may be the easiest step because in many cases it is routine.Planning the method, however, is one of the most difficult steps."
8574,好的方法旨在最大化研究的内在效度和外在效度。,Good methods attempt to maximize both the internal validity and the external validity of the study.
8574,内在效度和外在效度，和研究设计所采用的研究控制有所关联。,Internal validity and external validity relate to the research design and controls that are used.
8575,"最常见的瓣膜问题是二尖瓣脱垂。补充一句，“二尖瓣”（mitral）这个词源自“主教冠”（miter),它是主教戴的帽子，有两个尖。","The most common valve problem is mitral valve prolapse (the name ""mitral"" by the way, comes from miter, the two-leaved hat worn by popes), in which the valve between the left atrium and left ventricle doesn't slam closed fully just like in Figure"
8575,如图2.3所示，位于左心房和左心室之间的瓣膜不能正常闭合。,2.3.
8576,护胸多年来就是接球手的保护装备。,Chest protectors have been a part of the catchers protective equipment for years.
8576,近年来，人们越来越关注如何将护胸应用在所有棒球运动员身上，以避免发生心脏震荡。,"Recently, more attention has been focused on the use of chest protectors for all baseball players in an attempt to prevent commotio cordis."
8576,1986年，美国消费者产品安全委员会建议棒球运动员应穿着护胸 (King & Viano，1986)。但是因为价格昂贵且笨重，很少有击球手和防守队员应用护胸。,"In 1986, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission recommended that baseball players wear chest protectors (King & Viano, 1986).However, the acceptance of chest protectors by batters and defensive players has been poor because of cost and bulkiness."
8577,可溶性纤维溶子水，它能调节新陈代谢和消化作用，稳定人体血糖值。,Soluble fiber does dissolve in water; it regulates metabolism and digestion and stabilizes blood glucose levels.
8577,它常见于谷类，例如燕麦、 大麦和黑麦。豆类中也有可溶纤维，如蚕豆、豌豆和扁豆，一些麦片中也有。,"And it s found mostly in grains such as oats, barley, and rye; in legumes such as beans, peas, and lentils; and in some cereals."
8578,新同性恋恐惧症作为一种阴险的文化实践，因为它允许少数性取向不同的人的价值观、信仰和实践从边缘化走向繁荣。,"Neo-homophobia as a cultural practice is insidious because it allows the values, beliefs, and practices that marginalize sexual minorities to flourish."
8578,新同性恋恐惧症也作为策略让我们难以厘清对于性的文化理解的真相。,Neohomophobia also serves as a device to obscure the truth about our cultural understandings of sexuality.
8578,然而，据实以告是一个民主制度中新闻建构的临界值。,"Yet, truth-telling is a critical value for the journalistic establishment in a democracy."
8578,我们希望通过研究，告诉记者多涉及体育、性别和权力的关键报道，我们可以鼓励媒体制造更具批判性的、更深思熟虑的、更勇敢的故事报道方式。,"We hope that in examining the ways journalists tell the critical stories involving sports, gender, and power, we can encourage media producers to more critically, thoughtfully, and courageously approach such stories."
8579,在形上学里，哲学家尝试分析事物的本质。,"In metaphysics, philosophers attempt to analyze the nature of things."
8579,这项工作的范围从单纯的区辨（例如：分辨运动与舞蹈）到更复杂与具争议的议题（例如：描述竞争活动里完美的本质）。,"The scope of this work runs the gamut from simple distinctions (e.g., distinguishing sport from dance) to more complex and controversial theses (e.g."
8579,也可能同时描绘出有明确界线的清楚定义，或反而是更不精确，也许用模糊、不清的界线的相似的类属来叙述。,", describing the nature of excellence in competitive events).It may also portray categories as clearly defined with sharp edges, or alternately as less distinct, perhaps in terms of family resemblances with fuzzy or blurry lines of demarcation."
8580,胸围（chest girth)。,Chest girth.
8580,在胸骨中点（第三、四肋间）水平上呼气末期的胸廓围度。,End-tidal perimeter of the chest at mesosternale level.
8580,受试者稍稍将前臂外旋，测试者就可以斜站在受试者的右侧并将卷尺从躯干后面绕过到达前面，并用右手握住。,The subject slightly abducts the arms to permit you standing obliquely to his or her right side to pass the tape behind the torso so you can reach in front and grasp it w ith your right hand.
8580,这时，卷尺和外鞘的末端用右手握住，左手腾出来在受试者背后调整卷尺，或者在前面调整到胸骨中点水平。,The stub end of the tape and housing is then held in your right hand freeing your left hand to adjust the tape at the subject's back or front to the horizontal level of the marked mesosternale.
8581,在成人身上，胸 腺要小得多。,"In adults, the thymus is much smaller."
8581,随着年龄的增长，胸腺缩小 的程度很大。到了 80岁左右的时候它就几乎看不见了。,"It actually shrinks dramatically as you age, until it is barely noticeable in eighty-year-olds."
8581,推测起来，这种萎缩是因 为当你是一个孩子时需要更强大的免疫系统，你那时还没有接触到很多使你致 病的病毒和细菌。,"Presumably, this shrinkage is because you need a stronger immune response as a child, because you haven't yet been exposed to many of the viruses and bacteria that can make you sick."
8582,在实验研究中，因果的建立比统计与实验设计来的重要。,The establishment of cause and effect in an experimental study is much more than a statistical and design issue.
8582,这个议题属于逻辑的一种。,The issue is one of logic.
8582,如果虚无假设不成立的话，那么什么假设会是成立的呢？,"If the null hypothesis is not true, then what hypothesis is true?"
8582,当然，学者会希望研究假设是成立的，但是这并不容易建立。,"Of course, the scholar hopes the research hypothesis is true, but this is difficult to establish."
8583,该昏厥的机制是站立时从身体下部回流到左心室的血液突然减少引起的。,The mechanism for this reaction begins with reduced left ventricular filling secondary to pooling of blood in the lower parts of the body during standing.
8583,左心室容量下降的结果是位于左心室的特殊感受器受到刺激，引起反射性心率减缓和血管扩张（特别是大脑血管的扩张）。,This reduction in left ventricular volume results in the stimulation of the special receptors that are located in the left ventricle that cause a reflex slowing of the heart rate and vasodilation of the blood vessels (especially in the brain).
8583,这是一个自相矛盾的反应，在有血管失张力性昏厥倾向的人中可以看到。,This is a paradoxical response and is seen in individuals who are prone to vasodepressor syncope.
8584,这些巨大泡沫状细胞非常贪婪，人体血液供应渐渐无法赶上它们生长的速度。,"Those big, foamy cells get so greedy they outgrow the blood supply."
8584,这时，一些泡沫细胞会因缺血而饿死，临死的细胞变得“易怒”，像我们有时梳头会被静电打到一样，在这些细胞上也产生电荷。这种电荷吸引来更多“闯来的闹事少年”，即黏稠的血小板。它们喜欢成群活动，在动脉中形成血凝块。,"When that happens, some of them begin to starve from lack of blood, and as they die, they become “irritable”一they have an electrical charge to them, similar to the electric shock you get sometimes while combing your hair That charge attracts even more of the Busch-drinking, sixteen-year-old party crashers: sticky blood platelets, which like to travel in crowds and form clots in your arteries."
8585,此时，麦肯齐正为他的训练方式与大众所接受的训练方式之间的巨大差异而沮丧。,"MacKenzie, meanwhile, was frustrated by the tremendous gap between what he was teaching and what he was perceived to be teaching by much of the outside world."
8585,部分原因似乎是批评者将CrossFit这两个概念混淆了。CrossFit是一种普遍的健身项目，而麦肯齐的专项训练计划——CFE——是以CrossFit的训练模式为核心内容之一，但训练内容更加丰富。,"Part of the problem seemed to stem from the failure of many critics to differentiate between CrossFit, a general fitness program, and CrossFit Endurance (CFE), MacKenzie’s sport-specific program that has CrossFit-style workouts as one of its pillars but is also much more."
8586,我们生活在“现在就要”的社会里，今天的孩子并不把耐心当作美德——大人也一样。,We live in “want it now” society; kids today don’t see patience as a virtue.Nor do adults.
8586,类固醇是现代人想要迅速见到效果的另一个例证。,Steroids are another reason why modern people expect to see results tomorrow.
8586,类固醇的确带来了“速效”（哪怕是暂时的、不健康的），而逐渐培养训练势头的古老技艺几近失传。,"Steroids bring such fast—albeit temporary and unhealthy—results, that the older art of gradually building training momentum has largely been lost or forgotten."
8587,许多英国人不会定期检査保养牙齿，因为在全国卫生福利规定中，牙科项目不能免费。,Many people in Great Britain don't have regular dental care because it's not provided free by the National Health Service.
8587,但是当他们因为胸痛去医院治疗时，医生会开给他们阿司匹林和抗生素治疗牙龈炎（1）。医生们很清楚，心血管系统的老化和工作不畅与牙龈发炎有很大的关联。,"But when people in Great Britain go to the hospital with chest pain, they're given an aspirin, a beta-blocker, and an antibiotic for gum disease—because doctors know there's a strong link between the inflammation of gum disease and an aging and unstable cardiovascular system."
8588,一般而言，硕士论文的引言和研究方法组成为研究计划，在未实际进行研究前先呈交给学生的论文委员会。,The introduction and methods section often comprise the research proposal and are presented to the student’s thesis committee before the research is undertaken.
8588,因为是研究的构想，因此会以未来式的口吻撰写，直到硕士论文正式完成后再将其改造为过去式。,"For the proposal, these two parts are often written in future tense and then changed to past tense when the final version of the thesis is completed."
8588,研究计划里通常会呈现一些初步研究资料，来展现出这个学生具有使用必要的研究工具来收集资料的专业能力。,The research proposal often contains some preliminary data demonstrating that the student has the required expertise to collect the data using the instrumentation needed.
8589,毫无疑问地，结果的分析与解释为最具挑战性的步骤。,That analyzing and interpreting results is the most challenging step goes without question.
8589,本步骤里，研究者须提供证据支持或拒绝研究假设，在这个过程，研究者也须和其他相关研究结果（相关文献的研究结果）做比较，而且，需试着把不同研究的结果串连并整合成为理论的模式。,"It is here that the researcher must provide evidence for the support or rejection of the research hypothesis.In doing this, the researcher also compares the results with those of others (the related literature) and perhaps attempts to relate and integrate the results into some theoretical model."
8589,本步骤通常需应用到归纳的推理（演绎推理则主要用在问题的陈述上）。,Inductive reasoning is employed in this step (whereas deductive reasoning is primarily used in the statement of the problem).
8590,研究整合并不只是将许多研究结果排列进某种序列里。,A research synthesis is not just a summary of studies arranged in some kind of sequence.
8590,它应该是具结构化、分析式，以及批判式，且能引导至特定的结论。,"It should be structured, analytical, and critical and lead to specific conclusions."
8590,统合分析是一种被定义的方法论，其能够量化结果，并且让统计技术能够被用来当成分析的工具。,The meta-analysis is a definitive methodology that quantifies results and allows statistical techniques to be used as a means of analysis.
8591,20世纪70年代之前，身体中段终极练习的桂冠有两个“竞争者”——仰卧起坐与举腿。,In the old days of training—before the nineteen-seventies—two exercises used to vie for the title of “ultimate” midsection exercise.These exercises were sit-ups and leg raises.
8591,其实，仰卧起坐与举腿锻炼中段的方式类似，但方向相反：仰卧起坐是腹肌收缩提起躯干，举腿是腹肌收缩提起下肢。,"Sit-ups and leg raises work the midsection in similar ways, but from opposite directions; in sit-ups, the abdomen contracts to lift the torso; in leg raises, the abdomen contracts to lift the lower limbs."
8591,记住，真的完全不需要两项都练。我之前说过，腹肌没有所谓“上”“下”之分，只有收缩或者不收缩。,"Remember, you really don’t need to do both—as I said earlier, there are no “upper” or “lower” abs.Either the abdomen contracts or it doesn’t."
8591,哪个经典练习更好呢？,So which of these two classics is best?
8592,在胰岛素治疗充分的情况下，运动中出现低血糖的危险与循环胰岛素不减少有关，这种情况在非糖尿病者中会发生。,"Under adequate insulin therapy, the risk of hypoglycaemia during physical activity is due to the absence of a decrease in circulating insulin, which occurs in the non-diabetic."
8592,而高胰岛素血症是由胰岛素从皮下储备中释放引起的。,"Moreover, hyperinsulinaemia may result frominsulin liberated from subcutaneous stores."
8592,葡萄糖生成的阻断最终导致低血糖。,Blockage of glucose production eventually leads to hypoglycaemia.
8592,"胰高血糖素和肾上腺素对血糖下降反应不良的患者发生严重低血糖的危险性较大（Kleinbaum & Shamoon, 1983)。","There is a greater risk of severe hypoglycaemia in patients with a poor glucagon and adrenaline response tolowered blood glucose (Kleinbaum & Shamoon, 1983)."
8593,我们已经讨论决定变项之间关系的统计技术。,We have explored some statistical techniques for determining relationships among variables.
8593,最简单的相关性统计技术为皮尔森相关系数，其描述两个变项之间的关系。,"The simplest type of correlation is the Pearson r correlation, which describes the relationshipbetween two variables."
8593,我们介绍了线性回归，其可以从一个变项来预测另一个变项。,"We introduced linear regression, which can be used to predict one variable from another."
8593,相关系数的诠释可以分为显著性（可靠性）和意义（r2) ，代表一个测量方法的总变异量的比例，这可以藉由其它测量方法进行解释。,"Correlation is interpreted for significance (reliability) and for meaningfulness (r2), which indicates the portion of the total variance in one measure that can be explained or accounted for by the other measure."
8594,人们知道的所用重量最大的练习很可能是硬拉。做硬拉需要训练者把很重的杠铃拉离地面，提到髋部的位置。,"The heaviest exercise known to man is probably the deadlift, in which the athlete picks a heavy barbell off the floor and up to the hips."
8594,现在，硬拉的世界纪录是由著名举重运动员安迪·博尔顿(Andy Bolton) 创造的，他能拉起455千克——将近半吨重的杠铃！,"The world record is currently held by famous powerlifter Andy Bolton, who lifted 1003 lbs.under official conditions.That’s over half a ton!"
8595,麦肯齐的饮食方案还包括一种自制的运动饮料，含有一种长链的淀粉，目的是提高脂肪利用率。,MacKenzie’s diet includes a sports drink of his own creation that includes a long-chain starch shown to boost fat utilization.
8595,他还定期食用鱼油，但是他已经开始按“周期”食用而不是每天食用了。,"He also takes fish oil on a regular basis, although he has begun to ""cycle"" it rather than take it every day."
8595,因为麦肯齐注意到，如果他每天定期食用鱼油，Q-3脂肪酸（鱼油中含有）所提高的恢复速度开始减缓了。,MacKenzie has noticed that the jolt of accelerated recovery provided by omega-3 fatty acids (which are contained in fish oil) drops off if he takes the oil on a daily basis.
8595,他发现身体开始适应了。,His observation is that the body adapts to it.
8595,“两天吃、一天不吃是一个理想的周期。”他说。,"""Two days on, one day off seems to be a good cycle,"" he says."
8596,举个关于使用DFA的例子。让我们假设某一位研究人员欲预测哪位主修运动学的大学生会进入研究所就读、哪些会进入专业学校就读，以及哪些取得大学学位后不会继续升学。,"As an example of the use of DFA, let's assume that a researcher wants to predict which undergraduate kinesiology majors will go to graduate school, which will go to professional school, and which will not go beyond the bachelor's degree."
8596,该研究人员取得了毕业生为期5年的资讯以及其相信有助于发展出预测方程式的不同变项(如:大学时期的学业成绩平均点数-即GPA、主修的GPA、大三的动机问卷调查结果以及未来规划)。,"She has information on graduates for a 5-year period and a variety of variables that she believes would help create a prediction equation (e.g., undergraduate GPA, GPA in the major, a motivation questionnaire from the junior year, an indication of future plans)."
8597,为了更好地预防损伤的发生，必须知道，有相当部分的受伤儿童（32%）在过去一年曾在同一部位发生过损伤 (Nielsen & Yde，1988)。,"With a view to prevention it is very import­ ant to realize that a substantial number of the injured children (32%) had experienced the injury before at the same site within the past year (Nielsen & Yde, 1988)."
8597,女孩更容易发生再损伤。,
8597,,Girls had the highest risk of reinjury.
8597,"踝关节扭伤与髌骨软化病是最容易复发的损伤（DeHaven & Lintner, 1986; Backx, 1991)。","Ankle sprain and chondromalacia of the patella reoccurred most frequently (DeHaven & Lintner, 1986; Backx, 1991)."
8598,预期表可以用来预测某些表现的机率（学术上或工作上的表现）。,"An expectancy table can be used to predict the probability of some performance (e.g., academic, job-related)."
8598,预期表是容易编制的。预期表由双向细目组成，包含一个人在特定的评分中达成不同标准成绩的机率。,An expectancy tables is easily constructed; it consists of a two-way grid containing the probability of a person with a particular assessment score attaining some criterion score.
8599,参考这些理论，韦斯等（1990) 以8-13岁的儿童为研究对象，探讨了运动能力感与比赛结果原因之间的关系。,"Given this conceptualization, Weiss et al. (1990) examined the relationship between perceived physical competence and attributions for sport performance among 8—13-year-old children."
8599,他们的研究结果支持原先的理论假设：与那些低运动能力感的儿童相比，高运动能力感的儿童更倾向于把知觉到的成功归因为 内在的、稳定的、个人可控的因素。,"They found support for theoretical predictions in that children who were higher in perceived competence made attributions for perceived success that were more internal, stable and personally controllable than did low perceived competence children."
8599,而且用知觉到的成功、对未来成功的期望以及稳定的归因可以把能力感得分前1/4的儿童和后1/4的儿童加以区分。,"Moreover, children in the upper quartile of perceived competence scores could be discriminated from their lower quartile peers on the basis of perceived success, future success expectations and stability attributions."
8600,如果你让受试者以恒定的速度在跑步机上跑步，如8km/h，可以通过测量他们身体氧气的使用量（摄氧量，或VO2)来确定他们的能量消耗。,"If you ask subjects to run on a treadmill at a constant speed, say 5 miles (8 km) per hour, you can determine their energy expenditure by measuring how much oxygen their bodies use (oxygen uptake, or VO2)."
8600,现在，跑步机的速度不变，但让他们跑出几个不同的步长和步频的组合。,"Now, keep the treadmill speed the same, but have them run at several different combinations of stride length and frequency."
8600,如果对VO2进行绘制，会看到一个U形曲线，如图2.2所示。,"If you plot a graph of VO2 versus either of these, you will see a U-shaped curve, as indicated in figure 2."
8600,显然，运动控制器的一个特定节奏（与最低能量需求匹配的某个步频）对这些跑步运动员是最经济的。,"2. Obviously, a particular tempo of the motor controller (a certain stride frequency that matches the lowest energy demand) is most economical for these particular runners."
8600,如果受试者偏离这个比例或步长，能源成本会上升。,"And if the subjects deviate from this rate or stride length, the energy cost goes up."
8601,有许多治疗方法能帮助你止住疼痛，使你的身体能够重新做出调整。比如布洛芬(抗炎、镇痛药），和用辣椒素制成的乳霜（这种成分是在辣椒中发现，它帮助疼痛接收器官一起处理慢性疼痛）。,There are many therapies that help interrupt pain so your body can reset—such as ibuprofen and even creams made with capsaicin (the ingredient found in chili peppers; it binds with pain receptors to help manage chronic pain).
8601,另一种选择是针灸，这是一种东方式的治疗方法，主要集中在贯穿全身的能量经脉这一概念。,Another option is acupuncture—the Eastern style of medicine that focuses on the concept of energy meridians that pass throughout your body.
8601,通过集中于你疼痛的某个区域，针灸能够重新调整你的疼痛忍受限度，并通过你身体的通道更改疼痛的方向。,"By focusing on specific areas of pain, acupuncture resets your pain thresholds and redirects pain through your body's pathways."
8601,如果你的确在考虑针灸，我们力劝你去那些有授权和执照的医生那里。,"If you do consider acupuncture, we urge you to see someone who is accredited and licensed."
8602,,The goal of the tester is to remove error to yield the true score.
8602,信度系数（coefficient of reliability)是真实分数变异量与观察分数变异量的比率。,The coefficient of reliability is the ratio of true score variance to observed score variance.
8602,由于真实分数的变异量无法得知，因此要以观察分数变异量减去误差分数变异量来估计。,"Because true score variance is never known, it is estimated by subtracting error variance from observed score variance."
8602,因而信度系数反映的是测量值不受误差变异量影响的程度。,"Thus, the reliability coefficient reflects the degree to which the measurement is free of error variance."
8603,因此， IV有两种水准（前测与无前测），而IV2有两种水准（实验处理与无实验处理）。,"Thus, IV, has two levels (pretested and not pretested), and IV2 has two levels (treatment and no treatment)."
8603,在ANOVA里， IV的F值建立了前测的效果，IV2的F值建立了实验处理的效果，而交互作用的F值能评估前测与实验处理之间外在效度威胁的交互作用。,"In the ANOVA, the F ratio for IV, establishes the effects of pretesting, the F for IV2 establishes the effects of the treatment, and the F for interaction evaluates the external validity threat of interaction of the pretest with the treatment."
8603,表18.2摘要整理出真实验设计中对效度威胁的控制。,Table 18.2 summarizes the control of threats to validity for the true experimental designs.
8604,贝诺伊特的神话当然来自于他拥有职业摔角手的家族传统。,Benoit's myth was surely grounded in his pedigree as a professional wrestler.
8604,当贝诺伊特只是一个加拿大普通少年儿童时，他就展现出了对职业摔角的巨大的兴趣。他崇拜那些已经成名的摔角手，比如布雷特“职业杀手”哈特（Bret “The Hit Man” Hart)，著名英国摔角组合斗牛犬(The British Bulldogs)的一员，被人们所熟知为“ 炸药小子”（The Dynamite Kid) 的汤姆• 比林顿（Tom Billington) 。,"Benoit showed interest in professional wrestling as a teenager in Canada, idolizing established wrestlers like Bret ""The Hit Man"" Hart and the one-half of famous tag team The British Bulldogs, Tom Billington, who was known as ""The Dynamite Kid."""
8605,有时候研究者也会呈现分数的全距（最高和最低），特别在使用中位数而非平均数时。,"Sometimes the range of scores (highest and lowest) may also be reported, particularly when the median is used rather than the mean."
8605,中位数和平均数可以相互搭配使用。,The median and the mean may be used in connection with each other.
8605,举例来说，有15个参与者执行了10组、每组10个尝试(共100次尝试）的反应时间任务。,"For example, 15 people might be given 10 blocks of 10 trials (100 total trials) on a reaction-time task."
8605,实验者可能会选择每一回合的10次尝试里的中位数值，做为最具代表性的分数。,The experimenter may decide to use the median reaction time of a person’s 10 trials as the most representative score in each block.
8605,因此每个人将会有10个中位数分数，每一个都是从单一回合10次尝试中选出的。在这种情况下，研究者应该要说明选出中位数的分数全距。,"Thus, each person would have 10 median scores, one for each of the 10 trial blocks.Here, the range of scores from which the median was selected should be reported."
8606,同天重测法（same-daytest-retestmethod)几乎只用于身体表现测验，因为练习效果与回忆效果会让纸笔测验产生不真实而过高的相关系数。,The same-day test-retest method is used almost exclusively with physical performance tests because practice effects and recall tend to produce spuriously high correlations when this technique is used with written tests.
8606,在同一天进行重测会比不同天的重测有较高的信度系数。,The test-retest on the same day results in a higher reliability coefficient than does a test-retest on separate days.
8606,我们理所当然的会预期在同天的表现会比不同天的表现有较高的一致性。,We would certainly expect more consistency of performance within the same day than on different days.
8606,组内相关用来分析测试与测试之间的一致性。,Intraclass orrelation is used to analyze trial-to-trial (internal) consistency.
8607,主动脉破裂是真正的医学急症，这些人必须立刻送到最靠近 的医疗单位进行诊断。,Dissection of the aorta is a true medical emergency and this individual should be transported immediately to the nearest diagnostic facility.
8607,心包的疾病包括创伤后心包积液是儿童胸痛的另外一个原因。,Diseases of the pericardium include post- traumatic pericardial effusion which is another cause of chest pain in children.
8607,冠状动脉疾病也可以引起胸痛。,Diseases of the coronary artery may also result in chest pain.
8607,冠状动脉的起源异常或深陷的冠状动脉是造成胸痛的两个常见的原因。,Anomalies of the origin of a coronary artery or entrapment of a coronary artery are two common varieties that result in chest pain.
8608,毫无疑问，古人使用了许多不同体系的体操来锻炼身体。,There were doubtless many different systems of calisthenics training used by the ancients.
8608,不过，从留存至今的文字与图像中我们所能了解的是，那些极富传奇色彩的战士和运动员的自身体重训练与今天广为人们熟知的“体操”几乎没有一点儿相似之处——远不是一种软绵绵的有氧训练。而更像是力量训练。,What we do know from the surviving descriptions and images was that the bodyweight training performed by these legendary warriors and athletes bore little resemblance to what is known as “calisthenics” today.
8608,事实上，他们的锻炼方法的确更适用于增强力量和爆发力。,"Rather than being a relatively soft form of aerobic training, their systems would have looked more like gymnastics, and would definitely have been geared more solidly to the progressive development or power and strength."
8609,第二，与特殊领域自我概念相比，自尊逐渐被认为是更具整体性的结构。,"Second, self-esteem is context-free and subsequently viewed as a more global construct than domain-specific self-conceptions (Wylie, 1979; Elarter, 1986)."
8609,另外，自尊不仅是一个特殊领域自我概念的集合，而且自尊具有独立的结构。,"Furthermore, self-esteem is not merely an aggregate of domain-specific self-conceptions but an independent construct (Harter, 1987)."
8609,第三，自尊的发展受许多特殊因素的影响，这些特殊影响因素决定了哪些东西可以构成，而哪些不可以构成自尊。,"Third, self-esteem development is a function of particular influencing factors that help define what does and does not constitute self-esteem."
8610,萨金特（1921）最先发明了通过纵跳测试成人腿部最大功率的试验。,The measurement of maximal leg power by means of a vertical jump was first developed for adults by Sargent (1921).
8610,要求受试者尽可能向上进行垂直跳。,Subjects are required to jump vertically as high as they can.
8610,测试者在垂直跳的最高点用粉笔标上记号。,"At the peak of the jump, the examinee marks the measuring board with chalk."
8610,从跳跃的高度可以计算出受试者竭尽全力所能产生腿部“功率”的能力。,The subject's ability to exert 'power' with the legs is derived from the height of the jump.
8610,3次跳跃的最大值或平均值作为试验的得分。,The best or the average value of three jumps is generally taken as the test score.
8611,随着儿童和青少年越来越多参与到有组织的体育训练中来，举手投掷动作以及跑跳时足部受冲击而引发的反复微细创伤所导致的过度使用损伤与日俱增。,"As children and adolescents have participated in increasing numbers in organized sport training, the occurrence of overuse injuries from repetitive microtrauma of overhand throwing or foot impact in running and jumping have been encountered."
8611,令人遗憾的是，导致此类损伤发生的危险因素还未完全明确。,"Unfortunately, the details of the risk factors for injury are as yet not well understood."
8611,此外，因为青少年和儿童发生应力性骨折时该部位常常出 现大量硬结状物，此类损伤容易与肿瘤形成的病理改变相混淆。,"In addition, the presentation of these injuries may sometimes cause confusion with neoplastic lesions because of the abundant callous present in the child or the adolescent with stress fracture."
8612,7~19岁女性大腿 (□)和手臂（圏）肌肉耐 力（每公斤体重）增长的 速率。,Rate increase (per kg) in leg (□) and arm (0) muscle endurance in females aged 7—19 years old.
8612,大腿的数据引自 Saavedra et al. (1991); 手臂的数据引自Inbar (1985)和Blimkie ef a/.(1988)。,Data from Saavedra et al. (1991) for legs; Inbar (1985) and Blimkie et al. (1988) for arms.
8612,"最大身高增长速 度（PHV)是根据文献 (Tanner, 1962)确定的。","Peak height velocity (PHV) is assumed, based on the liturature (Tanner, 1962)."
8612,PPV，最大功率增长速度。,"PPV, peak power velocity."
8613,后来，中国政府采用了一套以罗马字母为基础的拼写系统，称为“拼音”，每个符号表示一个音。,"More recently, the Chinese government has adopted a spelling system called pinyin, which is based on the Roman alphabet, and in which each symbol represents a sound."
8613,下面是几个写作汉字和拼音形式的汉语词。,Following are several Chinese words in their character and pinyin forms.
8613,（拼音的罗马字母后面的数字是音调标记，可忽略。）,(The digit following the Roman letters in pinyin is a tone indicator and may be ignored.)
8614,另外还有一些例子支持与此类似的原理，我们称之为A-over-A原理。,"There are other examples that support a principle of this sort, which we will refer to as the A-over-A principle."
8614,请看46中的句子：46 a.Jolm kept the car in the garage？,Consider the sentences of 46:46
8614,(约翰把车存在车库里。,a. John kept the car in the garage.
8614,）b.Mary saw the man walking towards the railroad station.(玛莉看见那个人朝火车站走去。）,b. Mary saw the man walking toward the railroad station.
8615,一个创造新局面的政治行为，比如独立宣言，和一段力图创造某些新鲜事物，在行为上不是述愿而是述行，比如承诺，这样的文学言语之间是什么关系呢？,"What is the relationship between a political act, like a declaration of independence, that creates a new situation, and literary utterances, that try to invent something new, in acts that are not constative statements but are performative, like promises?"
8615,政治行为和文学行为都建立在述行语和述愿语这个错综、矛盾的联合体上。在这当中，为了成功，行为必须通过所指事态使人信服，但行为的成功又包括创造其所指条件。,"Both the political and the literary act depend on a complex, paradoxical combination of the performative and constative, where in order to succeed, the act must convince by referring to states of affairs but where success consists of bringing into being the condition to which it refers."
8615,文学作品声明要向我们讲述这个世界，但如果它成功了，它是通过创造它所讲述的人物和事件得以成功的。,"Literary works claim to tell us about the world, but if they succeed they do so by bringing into being the characters and events they relate."
8615,在政治领域的首创行为中也有类似的东西在起作用。,Something similar is at work in inaugural acts in thepolitical sphere.
8615,比如在美国的《独立宣言》中，最关键的句子是“因此，我们……严正声明，并郑重宣布：这些联合起来的殖民地从此是自由独立的国家，并且有权成为自由独立的国家。”宣布这些是独立的州，这是一个述行语，它应该使它所指的局面成为现实。但是在对这个声明的支持中就融进了述愿的语气，说它们应该是独立的州。,"In the ‘Declaration of Independence’ of the United States, for example, the key sentence runs: ‘We therefore . . . do solemnly publish and declare that these United colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent states.’ The declaration that these are independent states is a performative that is supposed tocreate the new reality to which it refers, but to support this claim is joined the constative assertion that they ought to be independent states."
8616,这种联合在英国成为许多理论争论的基础，不论在政治理论界，还是在文学文化研究界都是如此。,"This conjunction is the basis of much theoretical debate in Britain, in political theory as well as literary and cultural studies."
8616,有关文化与意义之间的关系的许多重大探索始于20世纪70年代的电影研究杂志《银幕》。它利用阿尔都塞和拉康的理论，力图搞清楚电影艺术表现形式的结构怎样建构主体或怎样为其定位。,"Crucial investigations of relations between culture and signification took place in the 1970s in the film studies magazine Screen, which, deploying Althusser and Lacan, sought to understand how the subject is positioned or constructed by the structures of cinematic representation."
8617,反映物这一概念模式在确定批评性分析的焦点和条件时所起的作用无论是明显的还是隐含的，我们都很难说清它到底在何种程度上促成了美学理论中特有的观点和发现。,
8617,在其中的一端，是柏拉图以镜子为比方得出的简单明了的派生物。,At one extreme we have Plato's simple and obvious derivatives from the mirror as analogue.
8617,例如，镜中反映的形象只是事物的幻影，勉强以二维来表示三维，因此具有欺骗性：这就降低了艺术的地位，因为它只是表象，与真理相距甚远。再说，镜子的唯一功用是反映一个完美无缺、绝对准确的形象，因此，当荷马和埃斯库罗斯等诗人背离了事物的真相时，我们便别无选择，只能说他们在撒谎。,"For example, a mirror-image is only a simulacrum of an object, forced deceptively to represent three dimensions by two; hence the lowly status of art as mere appearance, far removed from the truth, Also, the sole function of a mirror is to yield a flawless and accurate injage: correspondingly, when poets like Homer and Aeschylus depart from the truth of things, we have no alternative but to say that they are liars."
8618,60年代之后，在英国出现了争夺霸主权的危机，因为政府不能轻而易举地取得协调一致，所以它需要武装自己，以对付来自颇具战斗力的工会的反对势力，来自“恐怖主义者”和爱尔兰共和军的反对势力。,"After the 1960s there is a crisis for hegemony in Britain, and the state, unable to win consent easily, needs to arm itself against opposition from trade union militancy,‘terrorists’, the IRA."
8618,"这个被鼓动得更具活动能力的霸主政权在“闪电行动队”和“专业特警""这类警察故事中得到了反映。那些故事中的便衣警察打击恐怖主义的典型做法是以他们自己的暴力行为来对抗恐怖组织的暴力行为。",This more aggressively mobilized state of hegemony is reflected in such examples of the police genre as ‘The Sweeney’ and ‘The Professionals’ in which plain-clothes cops typically combat a terrorist organization by matching its violence with their own.
8619,很多在智力方面有残疾的人，尽管丧失了某些方面的能力，却在其他一些方面表现出卓越的才能。,"There are numerous cases of intellectually handicapped individuals who, despite their disabilities in certain spheres, show remarkable talents in others."
8619,有些顶级的音乐家和艺术家却没有简单的生活自理能力。,There are superb musicians and artists who lack the simple abilities required to take care of themselves.
8619,这样的人通常被称为白痴天才。,Such people are referred to as savants.
8619,有些非常出名的白痴天才是速算高手，算术演算的速度惊人，或者是算日历的高手，他们能不假思索地告诉你上个世纪或下个世纪的任何一天是星期几。,"Some of the most famous savants are human calculators who can perform arithmetic computations at phenomenal speed, or calendrical calculators who can tell you without pause on which day of the week any date in the last or next century falls."
8620,剧中人物所处的环境、他们的感情、他们的困境必须从外部加以理解，必须被表现为奇特的、有问题的。,"The situation, emotions and dilemmas of the characters must be understood from the outside and presented as strange and problematic."
8620,这并不是说，演员必须避免使用感情，而是要避免采用移情的手段。,"This is not to say that actors should avoid the use of emotion, but only the resort to empathy."
8620,用形式主义者的话来讲，就是要用“暴露的方法”（见第2章第33-34页）。,"This is achieved by ‘baring the device’, to use the Formalist term (see Chapter 2, pp. 33–34)."
8621,当然，文学本质的一个最重要的特征是，体裁这个概念对消费者和生产者一样有用。,Of course one of the most significant features of the nature of literature is the fact that the concept of genre is as useful to the consumer as to the producer.
8621,事实上，正如乔纳森·卡勒指出的那样，体裁的概念提供了“指导读者同文本遭遇时的标准或期望”。,"In fact, as Jonathan Culler points out, the concept of genre offers a ‘norm or expectation to guide the reader in his encounter with the text’."
8621,写在书籍封面上的“小说”、“诗歌”、“悲剧”这些标明体裁的词，把我们对它的阅读“纳入规划”，减少了它的复杂性，或确切地说，给它以可知的形式，使我们严格地按照它的原意来“阅读”，赋予它以语境和框架，允许整齐划一和错综复杂的现象出现。,"A genre-word, ‘novel’, ‘poem’, ‘tragedy’ placed on the cover of a book ‘programmes’ our reading of it, reduces its complexity, or rather gives it a knowable shape, enabling us literally to ‘read’ it, by giving it a context and a framework which allows order and complexity to appear."
8622,布罗卡失语症患者(又称语法缺失失语症患者)也可能很难理解复杂句：一方面，理解复杂句主要依赖句法结构；另一方面，理解这些句子时，患者对真实世界的知识派不上用场。,Broca’s aphasics (also often called agrammatic aphasics) may also have difficulty understanding complex sentences in which comprehension depends exclusively on syntactic structure and where they cannot rely on their real-world knowledge.
8622,比如：语法缺失失语症患者可能较难理解下面这类被动句中谁在吻谁的问题：Which girl did the boy kiss?（这个男孩吻了哪个女孩？,"For example, an agrammatic aphasic may have difficulty knowing who kissed whom in questions like:Which girl did the boy kiss?"
8622,） 在理解这类句子时，亲吻者是男孩或女孩对患者而言都是说得通的。患者对下列被动句也会感到一头雾水：The cat was chased by the dog.(猫被狗追。),where it is equally plausible for the boy or the girl to have done the kissing; or might be confused as to who is chasing whom in passive sentences such as:The cat was chased by the dog.
8623,现象学批评是运用现象方法于文学作品的尝试。,Phenomenological criticism is an attempt to apply the phenomenological method to literary works.
8623,正如胡塞尔“括起”真实对象一样，在现象学批评中，文学作品中的实际历史关联，它的作者、创作条件和读者都被置之不顾；相反，现象学批评的目标在于对本文进行全然“内在”的阅读，这种阅读根本不受任何外在之物的影响。,"As with Husserl's 'bracketing' of the real object, the actual historical context of the literary work, its author, conditions of production and readership are ignored; phenomenological criticism aims instead at a wholly 'immanent' reading of the text, totally unaffected by anything outside it."
8623,本文自身被还原为作者意识的纯粹体现：它的风格方面和语义方面的一切都被作为一个复杂总体的有机部分而把握，这一总体的统一本质就是作者的心灵。,"The text itself is reduced to a pure embodiment of the author's consciousness: all of its stylistic and semantic aspects are grasped as organic parts of a complex totality, of which the unifying essence is the author's mind."
8624,再往上大部分人叫作“嘴巴” 的，我们语言学工作者称为口腔，以区别于鼻腔。,"Finally there are the tongue and the lips, both of which are capable of rapid movement and shape changing."
8624,鼻腔包括鼻子、连接鼻子和喉咙的通道，加上鼻窦。,All of these together comprise the vocal tract.
8624,以上这些加起来叫声道。,Differing vocal tract shapes result in the differing sounds of language.
8625,在分析阅读诗篇的经验时，图表或象形符号便于说明，只要我们清楚地认识到其局限性。,"In the analysis of the experience of reading a poem, a diagram, or hieroglyph, is convenient, provided that its limitations are clearly recognized."
8625,比如图表各部分的空间关系并不是用 来表示所代表的内容各部分之间的空间关系。,"The spatial relations of the parts of the diagram, for instance, are not intended to stand for spatial relations between parts of what is represented; it is not a picture of the nervous system."
8625,它不是一张神经系统图，它也不是用来表示时间关系，空间比喻，不论画成图表还是仅仅存在于想象之中，只会给粗心的读者带来麻烦。,"Nor are temporal relations intended.Spatial metaphors, whether drawn as diagrams or merely imagined, are dangers only to the unwary."
8626,或者“秘密坐在其中”，这里使秘密成为一种能动作用，它能坐在其中（这是拟人法)。,Or ‘The Secret Sits’ makes the secret an agent capable of sitting (personification).
8626,修辞学家曾经试图把专门的“比喻用语”和涵盖而更广的、间接的 “修辞”手段区别开，前者“放弃”或者改变一个字的意义 (如用在比喻当中），而后者以字词的排列达到特定的效果。,Rhetoricians formerly attempted to distinguish specific ‘tropes’ which ‘turn’ or alter the meaning of a word (as in metaphor) from more miscellaneous ‘figures’ of indirection which arrange words to achieve special effects.
8626,有些修辞手法，比如头韵法（重复相同的辅音韵）；呼语法 (对本不能作为常规听众的事物讲话，如“平静下来吧，我 的心！”）；以及准押韵法（重复元音韵)。,"Some figures are: alliteration (the repetition of a consonant); apostrophe (addressing something that is not a regular listener, as in ‘Be still, my heart!’); and assonance (the repetition of a vowel sound)."
8627,读者对待一个词语声音的方式是随着已经产生的情感而变化的。,The way in which the sound of a word is taken varies with the emotion already in being.
8627,不过，进一步看，它又是随着意义而变化的。,"But, further, it varies with the sense."
8627,因为对声音的期待心理仅仅是总的期望的一个部分，它是由习惯、由感觉的常规所引起的。,"For the anticipation of the sound due to habit, to the routine of sensation, is merely a part of the general expectancy."
8627,语法的规则现象，使想法变得完整的必然性，读者关于所说之事的揣测心理，他在表现行动的戏剧文学方而对全篇的意图、情景、心态、以及对言者的领会，凡此种种还有诸多其它细节都有所介入。,"Grammatical regularities, the necessity for completing the thought, the reader’s state of conjecture as to what is being said, his apprehension in dramatic literature of the action, of the intention, situation, state of mind generally, of the speaker, all these and many other things intervene."
8628,发[l]时，舌尖抬起，而其他部位仍保持低位，让空气从舌头两侧流出。,"For [l] the tongue tip is raised while the rest of the tongue remains down, permitting air to escape over its sides."
8628,因而[l]叫作边音。,"Hence, [l] is called a lateral sound."
8628,你可以发tra la la体会la的位置。,
8628,,You can feel this in the “l’s” of Lolita.
8629,三个不同之处是：（1）泰语中有标类语素（量词），而英语中没有。,Three differences are (1) Thai has “classifiers.”They have no English equivalent.
8629,（2）泰语中的词（实际上是限定词）this和that接在名词之后，而英语中限定词放在名词之前。,"(2) The words (determiners, actually) “this” and “that” follow the noun in Thai, but precede the noun in English."
8629,（3）泰语中“进行体”由一个单独的动词来表达而且不会改变形式。,(3) The “progressive” is expressed by a separate word in Thai.The verb does not change form.
8629,在英语中，进行体是通过出现动词to be和在动词词尾加上-ing的形式来表不的。,"In English, the progressive is indicated by the presence of the verb to be and the adding of -ing to the verb."
8630,在某些情况下，一定的技巧带来绝妙的结果。这神技巧的明显特点起初被人视作优点的确切标志，后来则被看成优点本身。,"A certain technique in certain cases produces admirable results; the obvious features of  this  technique  come  to  be  regarded  at  first  as  sure  signs  of excellence, and later as the excellence itself."
8630,有段时间凡是没有表现出这些表面内记的意见均未受到应有的考虑，不论它们多么妙不可言。,"For a while nothing, however  admirable,  which  does  not  show  these  superﬁcial marks,  gets  fair  consideration."
8631,在语言学方面，乔姆斯基关于“能力”和“表现”的术语，对规则与行为的区别作了最佳表述，这一对术语与“语言”和“言语”正好对应。,"In linguistics the distinction between rule and behaviour is most conveniently expressed by Chomsky’s terms competence and performance, which are related, respectively, to langue and parole."
8631,由于种种原因，实际的行为并不是能力的直接反映。,Actual behaviour is not a direct reflection of competence for a variety of reasons.
8631,英语语言并不因其具体表现而穷尽。,The English language is not exhausted by its manifestations.
8631,它还包含迄今为止从未说出过的潜在语句，而这些语句则能呈现意义和语法结构；对于一个学会了英语的人来说，由于他有理解从未接触过的语句的能力，他就具备了超出其语言表现的语言能力。,"It contains potential sentences which have never been uttered but to which it would assign meaning and grammatical structure; someone who has learned English possesses, in his ability to understand sentences that he will never encounter, a competence that outstrips his performance."
8632,诗歌是诗人思想情感的流露、倾吐或表现：主要的类似提法还有：诗歌是修改、合成诗人意象、思想、情感的想象过程。,"Poetry is the overflow, utterance, or projection of the thought and feelings of the poet; or else (in the chief variant formulation) poetry is defined m terms of the imaginative process which modifies and synthesizes the images, thoughts, and feelings of the poet."
8632,按照这种思维方式，艺术家本身变成了创造艺术品并制定其判断标准的主要因素。我将把这种理论称为艺术的表现说。,"This way of thinking in which the artist himself becomes the major element generating both the artistic product and the criteria by which it is to be judged, I shall call the expressive theory of art."
8633,图画文字一旦被公认为代表某一事物，其意义就引申为该事物的属性或与之有关的概念。,"Once a pictogram was accepted as the representation of an object, its meaning was extended to attributes of that object, or concepts associated with it."
8633,至此，图画文字开始代表概念，而不再仅仅是事物。,Pictograms began to represent ideas rather than objects.
8633,这样的图画文字称为表意文字（即“意念图画”或“意念文字”)。,Such generalized pictograms are called ideograms (“idea pictures” or “idea writing”).
8634,与世界上许多其他语言相比，英语的屈折形态相对较少。,"Compared to many languages of the world, English has relatively little inflectional nmorphology."
8634,有些语言屈折程度非常高。,Some languages are highly inflected.
8634,"东非地区广泛使用的斯瓦希里语的动词可以与多种语素一起构成屈折变化，比如说nimepiga这个词（由ni +me + pig + a 构成）意思是“他打[撞到] 了什么东西”。这个动词的词根是p i g , 意思是“碰到”，它有两个屈折前缀：n i 的意思是“ 我”；m e 的意思是“ 完成的动作”，它的屈折后缀a 是一个表示宾语一致的语素。","In Swahili, which is widely spoken in eastern Africa, verbs can be inflected with multiple morphemes, as in nimepiga (ni + me + pig + a), meaning“he has hit something.”Here the verb root pig meaning“hit”has two inflectional prefixes: ni meaning“I,”and me meaning“completed action,”and an inflectional suffix a, which is an object agreement morpheme."
8635,"造成这种状况的一个原因是计算机一般只有一个的功能强大的处理器,它每次只能执行一项任务。","One reason for this is that, typically, computers have only a single, powerful processor, capable of performing a single task at a time."
8635,现在人们正在设计装有多个处理器的计算机，尽管这些处理器的功能没那么强大，但他们是互相连接在一起的。,"Currently, computers are being designed with multiple, interconnected processors that can do several things at once, much more like the human brain."
8635,这些计算机的能力既依赖于每个处理器的运算能力，也依赖于它们之间的连接。,The power of these computers lies both in the individual processors and in the connections.
8635,这样的计算机能够进行并行处理，或者说能够同时执行好几个任务。,"Such computers are capable of parallel processing, or carrying out several tasks simultaneously."
8636,卢梭在写“语言是为说而存在的；写作只能作为言语的补充”时正是继承了这种传统，而且它已经成为一种常识。德里达在这里插入了问题“补充是什么？” (韦伯斯特大 典）对该词的定义是“使完整，或者增补内容”。,"Rousseau follows this tradition, which has passed into common sense, when he writes, ‘Languages are made to be spoken; writing serves only as a supplement to speech.’ Here Derrida intervenes, asking ‘what is a supplement?’ Webster’s defines supplement as ‘something that completes or makes an addition’."
8636,那么写作是不是通过提供一些被遗漏的重要内容面使言语变得“完整”呢？还是增加了一些言语言本能身完全可以表达的内容呢？,"Does writing ‘complete’ speech bysupplying something essential that was missing, or does it add something that speech could perfectly well do without?"
8637,不定式句子没有时态。,An infinitive sentence does not have a tense.
8637,"嵌套句for you to sing, the president to leave early,和the president to be punctual都是不定式。","The embedded sentences for you to sing, the president to leave early, and the president to be punctual are infinitives."
8637,want和believe这样的动词可以把一个不定式作为补足语。,"Such verbs as want and believe, among many others, can take infinitival complements."
8638,布罗卡区受损的病人可能患上布罗卡失语症，这是我们今天所用的命名。,"Patients with injuries to Broca’s area may have Broca’s aphasia, as it is often called today."
8638,布罗卡失语症的特征为言语困难和某种找词困难，但主要是影响病人按句法规则造句的能力。,"Broca’s aphasia is characterized by labored speech and certain kinds of word-finding difficulties, but it is primarily a disorder that affects a person’s ability to form sentences with the rules of syntax."
8638,布罗卡失语症最显著的特点之一就是语句的语法缺失，即，语言中经常缺少冠词、介词、代词和助动词，这些被我们现在称之为“功能词”的词。,"One of the most notable characteristics of Broca’s aphasia is that the language produced is often agrammatic, meaning that it frequently lacks articles, prepositions, pronouns, auxiliary verbs, and other grammatical elements that we will call “function words” for now."
8638,布罗卡失语症也常常漏掉屈折形式，比如过去时后缀“-ed”或动词第三人称单数词尾“-s”。,Broca’s aphasics also typically omit inflections such as the past tense suffix -ed or the third person singular verb ending -s.
8639,UG 规定了一个短语的结构，短语必须有一个中心语，可能会有一个或多个补足语类型（前面讨论过的X-杠图示）。,UG specifies the structure of a phrase.It must have a head and may take one or more complement types (the X-bar schema discussed earlier).
8639,然而，每种语言都会定义自己的成分相对顺序：英语是中心语先于补足语，日语则是补足语先于中心语。,"However, each language defines for itself the relative order of these constituents: English is head initial, Japanese is head final."
8639,我们把这种变化称为参数。,We call the points of variation parameters.
8640,前面我曾论证，试图从方法或对象角度来界定文学研究的做法注定是要失败的。,I argued earlier that any attempt to define the study of literature in terms of either its method or its object is bound to fail.
8640,但我们现在已经开始讨论另一个可以区别各种话语的方法，它既非本体论的亦非方法论的，而是策略上的（策略话语）。,"But we have now begun to discuss another way of conceiving what distinguishes one kind of discourse from another, which is neither ontological or methodological but strategic (strategic discourse)."
8640,这就意味着，首先要问的并非对象是什么或我们应该如何研究它，而是我们为何应该研究它。,"This means asking first not what the object is or how we should approach it, but why we should want to engage with it in the first place."
8641,我们在上文可以看到，附加语素有固定的次序。,We saw earlier that morphemes are added in a fixed order.
8641,这种次序反映了词的层级结构。,This order reflects the hierarchical structure of the word.
8641,一个词并不是语素的简单序列，而是有内在的结构。,A word is not a simple sequence of morphemes.It has an internal structure.
8642,新批评家们经常发现的那种统一性其实并不存在于文本中，而是存在于阐释的行动中。,The unity which the New Critics so frequently discover is not in the text but in the act of interpretation.
8642,他们对总体理解的渴望产生了解释中“阐释的循环”。,Their desire for total understanding initiates the ‘hermeneutic circle’ of interpretation.
8642,文本中的每一个成分都要从整体来理解，而整体又要从由所有成分组成的总体性来理解。,"Each element in a text is understood in terms of the whole, and the whole is understood as a totality made up of all the elements."
8642,这种解释行动是产生文学“形式”的一个复杂过程的部分。,This interpretative movement is part of a complex process which produces literary ‘form’.
8643,尧斯对这些问题的解答来自汉斯-格奥尔格·伽达默尔的哲学阐释学，作为海德格尔的追随者，伽达默尔争辩说，对过去时代文学的一切阐释来自过去与现在的对话。,"Jauss’s answers to these questions derive from the philosophical ‘hermeneutics’ of Hans-Georg Gadamer, a follower of Heidegger (see above).Gadamer argues that all interpretations of past literature arise from a dialogue between past and present."
8643,我们试图理解一部作品，这取决于我们自己的文化环境允许我们提出的问题。,Our attempts to understand a work will depend on the questions which our own cultural environment allows us to raise.
8643,同时，我们力求发现作品本身通过与历史的对话要回答的问题。,"At the same time, we seek to discover the questions which the work itself was trying to answer in its own dialogue with history."
8644,这些句子描述相同的情景，在此意义上它们相关联。,These sentences describe the same situation.
8644,前一个句子断言存在着“男孩在睡觉”这样一种特定的情景。,"The sentence in the first column asserts that a particular situation exists, a boy-sleeping situation."
8644,这样的句子被称作陈述句。,Such sentences are called declarative sentences.
8645,一个句子的自然分组被称为成分。,The natural groupings or parts of a sentence are called constituents.
8645,各种各样的语言测试揭示了一个句子的成分。,Various linguistic tests reveal the constituents of a sentence.
8645,第一个测试是“独立”测试。,The first test is the “stand alone” test.
8645,如果一组词可以独立完整地存在，那么它们就是一个成分。,"If a group of words can stand alone, they form a constituent."
8646,带有句法范畴信息的树形图被称为短语结构树或成分结构树。,A tree diagram with syntactic category information is called a phrase struc- ture tree or a constituent structure tree.
8646,这棵树表明这个句子既是线性的一串词，又是短语套短语的层级结构。,This tree shows that a sentence is both a linear string of words and a hierarchical structure with phrases nested in phrases.
8646,短语结构树（简称PS树）清楚地用图形表征了说话者关于他所使用的语言中句子结构的知识。,"Phrase structure trees (PS trees, for short) are explicit graphic representations of a speaker’s knowledge of the structure of the sentences of his language."
8647,我们可以把文学作品理解成为具有某种属性或者特点的语言。我们也可以把文学看作程式的创造品，或者某种关注的结果。,"We can think of literary works as language with particular properties or features, and we can think of literature as the product of conventions and a certain kind of attention."
8647,哪一种视角也无法成功地把另一种全部包含进去。所以，我们必须在二者之间不断地变换自己的位置。,"Neither perspective successfully incorporates the other, and one must shift back and forth between them."
8648,齿沿音（或齿间音）[θ][ð]：这两个音在英文中都拼写为th。发音时舌尖插在上下齿之间。,"Interdentals [θ] [ð] These sounds, both spelled th, are pronounced by inserting the tip of the tongue between the teeth."
8648,不过有些人只是把舌头触及上齿沿后，所发之音更应称为齿音。,"However, for some speakers the tongue merely touches behind the teeth, making a sound more correctly called dental."
8649,齿沿音(或齿间音)[θ][ð]：这两个音在英文中都拼写th。发音时舌尖插在上下齿之间。,"Interdentals [θ] [ð] These sounds, both spelled th, are pronounced by inserting the tip of the tongue between the teeth."
8649,不过有些人只是把舌头触及上齿沿后，所发之音更应称为齿音。,"However, for some speakers the tongue merely touches behind the teeth, making a sound more correctly called dental."
8650,首先，标题中出现的“印花”和“饰边”告诉我们这些特点很走俏。,"In the ﬁrst place, the presence of imprimés and ganse in the captions tells us that these features are fashionable."
8650,其次，“印花”与“赛场”的组合意指它们尤其适合在这样一种特殊的社交场合穿着。,"At a second level, the combination of imprimés and courses signiﬁes that they are appropriate for this particular social situation."
8650,最后，“还有一种新的符号，其能指为完整的时装语言，其所指为这本杂志所期望表达的关于世界和关于时装业的形象”。,"Finally, there is 'a new sign whose signiﬁer is the complete fashion utterance and whose signiﬁed is the image of the world and of fashion that the journal has or wants to convey' (p. 47)."
8651,人们在书店里购买的词典，包含着我们心理词典中的一些信息。,The dictionaries that one buys in a bookstore contain some of the information found in our mental dictionaries.
8651,绝大多数早期词典编纂者以“规范”而非“描写”语词为己任。,
8651,,"However, the aim of most early lexicographers, or dictionary makers, was to prescribe rather than describe the words of a language."
8651,正如韦氏词典中所说的那样，他们努力成为确定语词“正确”发音和语义的“最高权威”。,"They strove to be, as stated in Webster’s dictionaries, the “supreme authority” of the “correct” pronunciation and meaning of a word."
8652,词典学曾经是关乎上千张纸的编纂学问，意味着持续的文本阅读和词汇检索而导致的视力衰退。,"Lexicography was once the science of a thousand slips of paper, and of eyesight gone bad from the continual reading of texts and searching for words."
8652,如今，幸有计算机分担了不少工作，词典的质量也达到前所未有的高度。,"Today, thankfully, the computer does much of the work and the quality of dictionaries has never been higher."
8652,许多词典甚至是机读的（电子的），从任何一台电脑都便于查检。,"Moreover, many dictionaries are now available in machine-readable (electronic) form, easily accessed from any computer."
8653,像Chomskyan/Chomskyite这种交替形式的冗余性--所有这些形式都符合正常的构词规则--可以解释词汇中的一些偶然缺位（又称“词汇空缺”）现象。,"The redundancy of alternative forms such as Chomskyan/Chomskyite, all of which conform to the regular rules of word formation, may explain some of the accidental gaps (also called lexical gaps) in the lexicon."
8653,偶然缺位指合式但并不存在的词。,
8653,,Accidental gaps are well-formed but nonexisting words.
8653,语言中实际存在的词仅仅是可能的词的一个子集而已。,The actual words in a language constitute only a subset of the possible words.
8654,其中一种技术要求受试者判定一串字母（如果用的是听觉刺激，就是一串语音)是不是一个词。,One technique involves asking subjects to decide whether a string of letters (or sounds if auditory stimuli are used) is or is not a word.
8654,如果该刺激是一个实际的词，他们就得按下一个按钮作为回应，倘若不是实际的词，就得按另一个按钮，他们做的就是词汇判定。,"They must respond by pressing one button if the stimulus is an actual word and a different button if it is not, so they are making a lexical decision."
8654,在这些以及与之相似的实验中，回应时间或反应时间通常称为RTs〕被测定并记录下来。,"During these and similar experiments, measurements of response time, or reaction time (often referred to as RTs), are taken."
8654,实验的基本假设是，受试者对某个特定任务的回应耗时越长，则所做的处理就越多。,"The assumption is that the longer it takes to respond to a particular task, the more processing is involved."
8655,只要你（有意无意地）尝试在自己的心理词库中寻找那些你判定是“可能的词”的音系串，你就能判定这个句子没有意义。,You can decide that the sentence has no meaning only if you attempt (unconsciously or consciously) to search your mental lexicon for the phonological strings you decide are possible words.
8655,这个过程被称为“词汇提取”，或者词识别，后面还会详细讨论。,"This process is called lexical access, or word recognition, discussed in detail later."
8655,"如果发现没sniggle, blick，prock和slar这样的词条，你就能下结论说这个句子中的音系串无意义。","Finding that there are no entries for sniggle, blick, prock, and slar, you can conclude that the sentence contains nonsense strings."
8655,对这些“词”的切分和搜索取决于对语法语素和句法的了解。,The segmentation and search of these “words” relies on knowing the grammatical morphemes and the syntax.
8656,对语素、词、短语和句子的语言学意义的研究叫作语义学。,"The study of the linguistic meaning of morphemes, words, phrases, and sentences is called semantics."
8656,语义学的分支学科包括词汇语义学，与词的意义以及词与词之间的意义关系有关；还有短语或句子语义学，研究的是比词大的句法单位的意义。,"Subfields of semantics are lexical semantics, which is concerned with the meanings of words, and the meaning relationships among words; and phrasal or sentential semantics, which is concerned with the meaning of syntactic units larger than the word."
8656,而对语境如何影响意义的研究，比如，为什么“这里很冷”这个句子在某种情景下会被解释为“把窗户关上”，则称为语用学。,"The study of how context affects meaning—for example, how the sentence It’s cold in here comes to be interpreted as “close the windows” in certain situations—is called pragmatics."
8657,每增加一个新的词缀，就会形成一个新的词干和新的词。,"With the addition of each new affix, a new stem and a new word are formed."
8657,语言学家有时候也用词基这个术语指将词缀加到上面的任何词根或词干。,Linguists sometimes use the word base to mean any root or stem to which an affix is attached.
8657,在上面的例子中，system，systematic，unsystematic和unsystematical都可以被视为词基。,"In the preceding example, system, systematic, unsystematic, and unsystematical are bases."
8658,与世界上许多其他语言相比，英语的屈折形态相对较少。,"Compared to many languages of the world, English has relatively little inflectional morphology."
8658,有些语言屈折程度非常高。,Some languages are highly inflected.
8658,东非地区广泛使用的斯瓦希里语的动词可以与多种词素一起构成屈折变化，比如说nimepiga这个词（由ni + me + pig + a 构成）意思是“他打[撞到]了什么东西”。,"In Swahili, which is widely spoken in eastern Africa, verbs can be inflected with multiple morphemes, as in nimepiga (ni + me + pig + a), meaning “he has hit something.”"
8659,综合法的一个极端例子，就是直到20世纪60年代中期还受到青睐的语法翻译法。运用该方法，学生学习词汇表、动词词形变化和语法规则表。,"An extreme example of the synthetic approach is the grammar translation method favored up until the mid-1960s, in which students learned lists of vocabulary, verb paradigms, and grammatical rules."
8659,学习者把一段段文章从目标语译为母语。,Learners translated passages from the target language into their native language.
8659,典型的情形是教师用学生的母语授课，授课重点是对课文进行语法分析，很少或根本就不会将所教授的语言情景化。,"The teacher typically conducted class in the students' native language, focusing on the grammatical parsing of texts, and there was little or no contextualization of the language being taught."
8660,支持天赋假说最有力的证据来自这样的观察，即我们最终习得的语法完全不取决于我们的语言经验。,The innateness hypothesis receives its strongest support from the observation that the grammar a person ends up with is vastly underdetermined by his linguistic experience.
8660,换言之，我们最终获得的语言知识大大超出了我们从周围听到的语言样本。,"In other words, we end up knowing far more about language than is exemplified in the language we hear around us."
8660,支持普遍语法天赋假说的这一论据叫作刺激贫乏。,This argument for the innateness of UG is called the poverty of the stimulus.
8661,正如你能看见的那样，索引也许用途有限，因为它是“未经加工的”。,"A concordance, as you can see, might be of limited usefulness because of its “raw” nature."
8661,改进索引的一个方法就是使用搭配分析。,A way to refine a concordance is through collocation analysis.
8661,搭配是指两个或多个词在语料库中出现时，它们彼此间的空间距离很小。,A collocation is the occurrence of two or more words within a short space of each other in a corpus.
8662,任何一个文本如果能做到所有这些，那它当然是非常不一般的。,Any set of texts that could do all that would be very special indeed.
8662,文学是什么，人们怎么会认为它就能做到这一切呢？,What is literature that it was thought to do all this?
8662,至关重要的一点是具有代表性的特殊结构在文学中起作用。,One thing that is crucial is a special structure of exemplarity at work in literature.
8662,一部文学作品—比如《哈姆雷特》—就其特点而言，是一个虚构人物的故事，而这个故事本身又在某些方面具有代表性，（不然，你为什么想读它呢？）但同时它拒绝界定那个代表性的领域或范围—正因如此，读者和批评家们才能如此轻松自如地谈论文学的“普遍性”。,"A literary work-Hamlet, for instance-is characteristically the story of a fictional character: it presents itself as in some way exemplary (why else would you read it?), but it simultaneously declines to define the range or scope of that exemplarity-hence the ease with which readers and critics come to speak about the ‘universality’ of literature."
8662,正是文学作品的这种结构才使我们比较容易把它们看作是在普遍意义上向我们讲述“人类环境'而不是局限在它们所描述或者说明的具体范畴之内。,The structure of literary works is such that it is easier to take them as telling us about ‘the human condition’ in general than to specify what narrower categories they describe or illuminate.
8662,《哈姆雷特》仅仅是关于王子的故事吗?仅仅是描述文艺复兴时期人物的故事吗？或者仅仅是有关喜欢内省的年轻人的故事？关于那些父亲死因不明的人们的故事？,"Is Hamlet just about princes, or men of the Renaissance, or introspective young men, or people whose fathers have died in obscure circumstances?"
8662,既然所有这些都不是令人满意的答案，所以对读者来说，还是不回答更容易些，如此便默认了它的普遍性。,"Since all such answers seem unsatisfactory, it is easier for readers not to answer, thus implicitly accepting a possibility of universality.In their particularity, novels, poems, and plays decline to explore what they are exemplary of at the same time that they invite all readers to become involved in the predicaments and thoughts of their narrators and characters."
8663,按照新古典主义最根本的参照框架，语言是思想的“外衣”，形象是语言的“服饰”，目的在于获得使诗的语言有别于纯教诲性语言的那种愉快情感。,"According to the most fuadamental neo-classic frame of reference, language is the 'dress' of thought, and figures are the 'ornaments' of language, for the sake of the pleasurable emotion which distinguishes a poetic from a merely didactic discourse."
8663,必须把这几个因素结合在一起，根据新古典主义的基本统一原则而形成一个整体。这个原则就是各部分之间的得体或相称——这是个复杂的要求，既必须适应诗体，也 必须适应所象征的内容，以及它所描述的说话人的性格和情绪状态。,"These elements must be joined to form a consistent whole according to the basic neo-classic unifying principle of the decorum or proportionableness of parts—a complex requirement, involving adjustment to the poetic kind, and the matter signified, as well as the character and emotional state of the speaker depicted."
8664,十九世纪文学批评的主要指向从欣赏者转向了作者，而从古代修辞学家朗吉努斯身上，也可看出类似于这一更替现象的倾向，浪漫主义理论的许多特有成分都源自他的理论。,Something approaching the nineteenth century displacement of the audience by the author as the focal term of reference is to be found in one classical rhetorician Longinus—the exemplar and source Of many characteristic elements of romantic theory.
8664,当然，他那篇论文并不是专门论诗的，也没有涉及一篇完整的诗歌，而只谈了“崇高”这一特征，而这种崇高正是“最伟大的诗人和作家获取成功”所依赖的主要优点。,"His treatise, of course, was not concerned specifically with poetry, nor with any poem in its entirety, but only with the one quality of the 'sublime,'that cardinal excellence from which 'the greatest poets and writers have derived their eminence.'"
8664,他在探讨崇高特性的过程中，跨越了传统的文体分野，也打破了韵文与散文的界限；崇高存在于荷马、德谟斯提尼、柏拉图、《创世纪》，以及萨福的一首抒情诗之中。,"His pursuit of 出is quality cuts across the conventional divisions of discourse as well as the boundary between verse and prose; sublimity is to be found in Horner, Demosthenes, Plato, the Book of Genesis, and a love-lyric of Sappho."
8665,“口音”这个术语也用来指那些非母语者的言语，非母语者是指那些将该语言作为第二语言来学习的人。,"The term accent is also used to refer to the speech of non-native speakers, who have learned a language as a second language."
8665,例如，一个以法语为母语的人所说的英语就带有法国口音。,"For example, a native French speaker’s English is described as having a French accent."
8665,在这个意义上，口音是指与母语的音系差异或是来自其母语的音系干扰。,"In this sense, accent refers to phonological differences caused by one’s native language."
8665,与地域方言的口音不同，这种外国口音并不能反映出说话人以前学习该语言时所在社团的言语（与其母语之间的）差异。,"Unlike regional dialect accents, such foreign accents do not reflect differences in the speech of the community where the language was learned."
8666,该图解说明，一个XP包含一个指定语，这本质上是一个修饰语（而且通常都是非强制性成分)，还包含一个X’。,"The first level is the XP itself.The second level consists of a specifier, which functions as a modifier (and which is generally an optional constituent), and an X' (i."
8666,例如，一个NP的指定语是限定词，而一个VP的指定语是诸如never或者often这样的副词，一个AdjP的指定语是一个表示程度的词，例如very或quite。,"e.,“X-bar”).For example, an NP specifier is a determiner; a VP specifier is an adverb such as never or often; an AdjP specifier is a degree word such as very or quite."
8666,任何X’都是由一个中心语X和一个补足语构成，补足语可以是短语范畴，因此这会导致出现递归。,"The third level is an expansion of X' and consists of a head X and a complement, which may itself be a phrasal category, thus giving rise to recursion."
8667,对于成人来说，在没有正规指导的情况下学习第二语言，通常是很困难的。,"It is often difficult for adults to learn a second language without formal instruction, even when they have lived for an extended period in a country where the language is spoken."
8667,（关于第二语言习得在第八章中有更为深入的讨论。,(Second language acquisition is discussed in more detAn introduction to language in chapter 8.)
8667,）教学语法假定学生已经掌握一种语言，并将目标语的语法与学生母语的语法进行比较。,Teaching grammars assume that the student already knows one language and compares the grammar of the target language with the grammar of the native language.
8667,单词的意义在释义词中给出——即给出学生母语中与之相对应的词，如法语词maison (房子）。,"The meaning of a word is provided by a gloss—the parallel word in the student’s native language, such as maison, “house” in French."
8667,这种方法假 定学生知道释义词“房子”的意义，从而也就知道maison一词的意义。,"It is assumed that the student knows the meaning of the gloss “house,” and so also the meaning of the word maison."
8668,声调分两种。,There are two kinds of tones.
8668,如果在整个音节都是平的调，就是调域调；如果音高在音节上有变动，或升或降，那就是曲拱调。,"If the pitch is level across the syllable, we have a register tone.If the pitch changes across the syllable, whether from high to low or vice versa, we have a contour tone."
8668,曲拱调内又分平仄，泰语是三个平调和两个仄调。,Thai has three level and two contour tones.
8668,声调语言通常有两到三个平调，还可能有一两个仄调。,"Commonly, tone languages will have two or three register tones and possibly one or two contour tones."
8669,确认人脑的哪些部分负责人类的语言能力，一直是一个核心问题。,An issue of central concern has been to determine which parts of the brain are responsible for human linguistic abilities.
8669,19世纪早期，弗朗兹·约瑟夫· 加尔提出了（脑功能）定位理论。该理论认为人类的不同认知能力和行为，都由脑的特定部分所控制。,"In the early nineteenth century, Franz Joseph Gall proposed the theory of localization, which is the idea that different human cognitive abilities and behaviors are localized in specific parts of thebrain."
8669,从我们现有的脑知识来看，加尔的某些特定的观点还是很滑稽的。,"In light of our current knowledge about the brain, some of Gall’s particular views are amusing."
8670,"显而易见,这样做的危险是,“殖民的主体”由制约他们的 西方意识形态模式确认,同时,西方意识形态则由它们具有控制力 的核心地位来确认。","The danger, evidently, is that ‘colonial sub-jects’ are confirmed in their subjection to Western ideological modes whose hegemonic role is at the same time reinforced."
8670,"这正是爱德华·赛义德探索与揭示的“东方主义”的观点(《东方主义》,1978)。赛义德的著述受他本人对巴勒斯 坦事业的政治责任心的推动,而他这本书对后殖民主义批评影响甚大。","This is the perspective of ‘Orientalism’ explored and exposed by Edward Said (Orientalism, 1978), a principal influence upon postcolonial criticism, whose work is shaped fundamentally by his position as an Arab-American and political commitment to the Palestinian cause."
8671,"这些动词形态是不对的，因为英语中有180个不规则的动词，如held, heard, cut和went，因为它们无法从规则中去推出。","These forms sound wrong to us because English contains about 180 irregular verbs like held, heard, cut, and went many inherited from Proto-Indo-European whose past-tense forms cannot be predicted by rule but have to be memorized by rote."
8671,在我们的心理词汇中，一个动词若是有它自己特有的过去式，那么正常的加-ed规则就被阻挡住。goed听起来不很文法，因为它被went阻挡住了。,"Morphology is organized so that whenever a verb has an idiosyncratic form listed in the mental dictionary, the regular -ed rule is blocked : goed sounds ungrammatical because it is blocked by went."
8671,在其他的场合，正常的规则可以自由地运用。,"Elsewhere, the regular rule applies freely."
8672,符号学的范围当然是极广泛的，从对动物的交流行为的研究（动物符号学）到诸如对形体交流（人体运动学和对近体学）、嗅觉符号（“气味代码”）、美学理论和修辞学这类指示系统的分析。,"The field of semiotics is of course enormous, ranging from the study of the communicative behaviour of animals (zoosemiotics) to the analysis of such signifying systems as human bodily communication (kinesics and proxemics), olfactory signs (the ‘code of scents’), aesthetic theory, and rhetoric."
8672,大体说来，符号学的疆界（如果它有的话）和结构主义接壤：两个学科的兴趣基本上是相同的。从长远看来，两者都应被囊括在第三个容量很大的可以简单地叫作交流的学科内。,"By and large, its boundaries (if it has any) are coterminous with those of structuralism: the interests of the two spheres are not fundamentally separate and, in the long run, both ought properly to be included within the province of a third, embracing discipline called, simply, communication."
8673,人的语言是“有句法的”，是指一段话语是有内在组织的语言行为，具有结构和一致性。,"Human language is “syntactic” in that an utterance is a performance with an internal organization, with structure and coherence."
8673,语言具有“命题性”，是指它能传递信息。,It is “propositional” in that it transmits information.
8673,"于是,在这个意义上，人的语言和动物通讯都是有目的的、有句法的和有命题性的。","In this sense, then, both human language and animal communication are purposive, syntactic, and propositional."
8674,然而，按照笛卡尔的哲学观点，即使是动物行为也可能是无限多样的。这种无限多样性是从计速表的读数也可能是无限多样的这个意义上来说的。,"However, in the Cartesian view even animal behavior is potentially infinite in its variety, in the special sense in which the readings of a speedometer can be said, with an obvious idealization, to be potentially infinite in variety."
8674,也就是说，如果动物行为是由外部刺激或内部状态(后者包括条件反射所建立的状态)控制的，那么，由于外部刺激的变化范围是无限的，因而动物行为也是无限多样的。,"That is, if animal behavior is  controlled by external stimuli or internal states (the latter including those established by conditioning), then as the stimuli vary over an indefinite range, so may animal behavior."
8675,一个新词通过应用形态规则进入词库，而另一些复杂的派生却可能被堵塞。,"When a new word enters the lexicon by the application of morphological rules, other complex derivations may be blocked."
8675,举例来说，Commun+ist（共产主义者）进入了英语，但是像Commun+ite（如同Trotsky+ite“托洛茨基主义者”）或者Commun+ian（如同grammar+ian“语法学家”）这样的词却进入不了；它们的构成被堵塞了。,"For example, when Commun + ist entered the language, words such as Commun + ite (as in Trotsky + ite) or Commun + ian (as in grammar + ian) were not needed; their formation was blocked."
8675,不过，有时候一个词的几种交替形式却可以共存：例如，Chomskyan和 Chomskyist，甚至可能还有Chomskyite，都可以用（三个变体的意思都是“乔姆斯基语言学观点的追随者”）。,"Sometimes, however, alternative forms do coexist: for example, Chomskyan and Chomskyist and perhaps even Chomskyite (all meaning “follower of Chomsky’s views of linguistics”)."
8676,带有句法范畴信息的树形图被称为短语结构树或是成分结构树。,A tree diagram with syntactic category information is called a phrase structure tree or a constituent structure tree.
8676,这棵树表明这个句子既是线性的一串词，又是短语套短语的层级结构。,This tree shows that a sentence is both a linear string of words and a hierarchical structure with phrases nested in phrases.
8676,短语结构树（简称为 PS 树）清楚地用图形表征了说话者关于他所使用的语言中句子结构的知识。,"Phrase structure trees (PS trees, for short) are explicit graphic representations of a speaker's knowledge of the structure of the sentences of his language."
8677,对语素、词语、短语和句子的语言学意义的研究叫作语义学。,"The study of the linguistic meaning of morphemes, words, phrases, and sentences is called semantics."
8677,语义学的分支学科包括词汇语义学，与词的意义以及词与词之间的意义关系有关；还有短语语义学或句子语义学，研究的是比词大的句法单位的意义。,"Subfields of semantics are lexical semantics, which is concerned with the meanings of words, and the meaning relationships among words; and phrasal semantics or sentential semantics, which is concerned with the meaning of syntactic units larger than the word."
8677,而对语境如何影响意义的研究，比如，为什么“这里很冷”这个句子在某种情景下会被解释为“把窗户关上”，则称为语用学。,"The study of how context affects meaning—for example, how the sentence ""It's cold in here"" comes to be interpreted as “close the windows” in certain situations—is called pragmatics."
8678,John whispered the message to Bill and then he whispered it to Mary.（约翰把消息悄声告诉比尔，然后又悄亩告诉玛丽。）其中的he可以指约翰或比尔。,John whispered the message to Bill and then he whispered it to Mary.he can refer to either John or Bill.
8678,而在口语形式中，如果把he念得特别重一些（这种额外的重音又称对比重音），那就一定是指比尔；如果he只按正常重音念，那就是指约翰。,"In the spoken sentence, if he receives extra stress (called contrastive stress), it must refer to Bill; if he receives normal stress, it refers to John."
8679,倘若你用右手指指点点，大脑左半球就会对你的行为负责。,"If you point with your right hand, the left hemisphere is responsible for your action."
8679,同样地，大脑左半球接收人体右侧获得的感觉信息 （如，右耳、右手、右眼视野），大脑右半球则接收来自人体左侧的感觉信息。,"Similarly, sensory information from the right side of the body (e.g., right ear, right hand, right visual field) is received by the left hemisphere of the brain, and sensory input to the left side of the body is received by the right hemisphere."
8679,这种现象被称为对侧脑功能。,This is referred to as contralateral brain function.
8680,同一音位的音位变体之间不产生对立。,The allophones of a phoneme do not contrast.
8680,"但是如果我们把开头的辅音变成带音，例如Dick，或者改变一下调音方式，变成sick,或者将其鼻音化变成nick，我们都可以得到新的词儿。","If we change the voicing and say Dick, or the manner of articulation and say sick, or the nasalization and say nick, we get different words."
8680,这些音之间是有对立的。,Those sounds do contrast.
8681,事实上，各种差异是被系统地组织起来，形成“对立”，而这些对立又被极为重要的种种关系联结在一起的。,"In fact, the diﬀerences are systematized into ‘oppositions’ which are linked in crucial relationships."
8681,因此，在英语中，词首音tin和词首音kin之间公认的差异是使每一个词具有不同的“意义”的决定者。,"Thus, in English, the established diﬀerence between the initial sound of tin and the initial sound of kin is what enables a diﬀerent ‘meaning’ to be given to each word."
8681,这就是说，每个词的意义在于它本身的语音和其他词的语音差异中的结构感。,This is to say that the meaning of each word resides in a structural sense in the diﬀerence between its own sounds and those of other words.
8681,在这种情况下，英语记录了在tin中[t]的发音和在kin中[k]的发音之间值得注意的，也就是能产生意义的对比或“对立”感。,"In this case, the English language has registered the contrast or sense of ‘opposition’ between the sound of /t/ in tin and the sound of /k/ in kin as signiﬁcant, that is, as capable of generating meaning."
8682,当席勒教他“猫”的手语时，他突然顿悟了所有的东西都有名字的原则，非常像海伦·凯勒当时的情形。,"In an epiphany reminiscent of the story of Helen Keller, Ildefonso grasped the principle of naming when Schaller tried to teach him the sign for ""cat."""
8682,他内心的堤防崩溃了，他要席勒教他所有他熟悉的名称。,"A dam burst, and he demanded to be shown the signs for all the objects he was familiar with."
8682,很快的，他就可以告诉席勒他的生平：他的父母非常穷，他如何恳求他们送他上学，他如何在各州巡回收割谷物，他如何逃避移民局的官员。,"Soon he was able to convey to Schaller parts of his life story: how as a child he had begged his desperately poor parents to send him to school, the kinds of crops he had picked in different states, his evasions of immigration authorities."
8683,这种温和的多元主义当然有真限度：用柯林思·布鲁克斯的话来说，诗是“把各种态度联合成为一个服从某一总体支配态度的等级体系”。,"There were, naturally, limits to this benign pluralism: the poem, in Cleanth Brooks's words, was a 'unification of attitudes into a hierarchy subordinated to a total and governing attitude'."
8683,多元主义当然是很好的，只要它不侵犯等级秩序；诗的质地上的各种变化当然是能够受到愉快欣赏的，只要这些没有触功它的主导结构。,"Pluralism was all very well, provided that it did not violate hierarchical order; the varied contingencies of the poem's texture could be pleasurably savoured, so long as its ruling structure remained intact."
8683,对立之物应该得到容忍，只要它们最终能够溶为一片和谐。,
8684,在这些神经官能症背后，精神分析发现植根于个人早期发展中的没有解决的冲突，它们很可能集中在俄狄浦斯阶段。事实上，弗洛伊德把俄狄浦斯情结称为“神经官能症的核心”。,"Behind these neuroses, psychoanalysis discerns unresolved conflicts whose roots run back to the individual's early development, and which are likely to be focused in the Oedipal moment; indeed Freud calls the Oedipus complex the 'nucleus of the neuroses'."
8684,一个病人表现出来的神经官能症状一般总是与他或她的心理发展受到阻碍或“固结”的前俄狄浦斯情结期的某一点有联系的。,"There will usually be a relation between the kind of neurosis a patient displays, and the point in the pre-Oedipal stage at which his or her psychical development became arrested or 'fixated'."
8684,精神分析的目的就是揭示神经官能症的潜因，从而把病人从他的内心冲突中解脱出来，使折磨病人的症状得到缓解。,"The aim of psychoanalysis is to uncover the hidden causes of the neurosis in order to relieve the patient of his or her conflicts, so dissolving the distressing symptoms."
8685,神话显然也体现出这种区分，这是因为，每一种神话的各自单独的叙述，即神话的言语，都从神话语言的基本结构中脱胎而出，并从属于这个基本结构：索福克里斯的《俄狄浦斯王》作为言语，是从整个俄狄浦斯神话的语言中派生出来的。,"Myth obviously embodies this distinction in that the individual version of each myth, its parole, derives from and contributes to the fundamental structure of its langue: Sophocles’s Oedipus Rex derives, as parole, from the langue of the total Oedipus myth."
8685,此外，第三个层次也是清晰可辨的。,"However, a third level is also discernible."
8685,在个人的叙述中，神话总是具有确定的时间的：它总是涉及传说在很久以前发生的事件。,"A myth is always, in its individual telling, located in time: it always refers to events alleged to have happened a long time ago."
8686,从图6.1上可以看到，口腔天花板分为(硬)腭和软腭。,Figure 6.1 shows the roof of the mouth divided into the (hard) palate and the soft palate (or velum).
8686,硬腭是口腔前部的骨质结构。,The palate is a hard bony structure at the front of the mouth.
8686,你可以用大拇指去感觉一下。,You can feel it with your thumb.
8686,先洗手，然后伸进拇指沿着硬腭往后一直到喉咙口，你会碰到柔软的软腭。,"First, wash your hands.Now, slide your thumb along the hard palate back toward the throat; you will feel the velum, which is where the flesh becomes soft and pliable."
8687,在许多不同的情况下，人们能够习得另一种语言。,People can acquire a second language under many different circumstances.
8687,在你开始读初中、高中或大学的时候，你也许已经学会了另一种语言。,"You may have learned a second language when you began middle school, or high school, or college."
8687,搬家到一个新的国家往往意味着习得一种新的语言。,Moving to a new country often means acquiring a new language.
8687,另外有些人，他们生活的社区或家庭中说多种语言，因此他们可能同时习得两种（或更多）语言。,Other people live in communities or homes in which more than one language is spoken and may acquire two (or more) languages simultaneously.
8687,第二语言习得或二语习得这个术语一般指已经习得了母语的人（成人或儿童）再去习得另一种语言。,"The term second language acquisition, or L2 acquisition, generally refers to the acquisition of a second language by someone (adult or child) who has already acquired a first language.This is also referred to as sequential bilingualism."
8687,双语语言习得这个术语则是指从婴儿时期（或三岁之前）开始同时习得两种语言。,"Bilingual language acquisition refers to the (more or less) simultaneous acquisition of two languages beginning in infancy (or before the age of three years), also referred to as simultaneous bilingualism."
8688,Pin中的/p/与spin 中的/p/，其发音显然是不同的，然而讲英语的人却说不出二者的差异：这里的“说不出”是说这种差异并不区分该语言中不同词汇的意义。,"The /p/ sound in ‘pin’ is evidently different from the /p/ sound in ‘spin’,but English speakers do not recognize a difference: the difference is not recognized in the sense that it does not ‘distribute’ meaning between words in the language."
8688,即使我们把它说成sbin，可听起来极可能还是spin。,"Even if we said ‘sbin’, we would probably hear it as ‘spin’."
8688,这一语言观的核心论点是，在我们使用语言的深层部分有一个体系支撑着，那就是成对的二元对立模式。,"The essential point about this view of language is that underlying our use of language is a system, a pattern of paired opposites, binary oppositions."
8689,现在我们可以用带声性、鼻音性、调音部位和调音方式来区别英语中所有的辅音。,"We are now capable of distinguishing all of the consonant sounds of English via the properties of voicing, nasality, and place and manner of articulation."
8689,例如，[f]是唇齿清（口）擦音；[n]是龈（带）鼻塞音。,"For example, [f] is a voiceless, (oral), labiodental fricative; [n] is a (voiced), nasal, alveolar stop."
8689,括号中的特征一般由于有冗余性就不说了。除非特别指出是鼻音之外，其他所有音都是口音；英语中所有鼻音都是带声的。,"The parenthesized features are usually not mentioned because they are redundant; all sounds are oral unless nasal is specifically mentioned, and all nasals are voiced in English."
8690,语音科学试图描写世界上所有语言中所用的所有的音。,The science of phonetics attempts to describe all of the sounds used in all languages of the world.
8690,声学语音学关注语音的物理属性；听觉语音学关注听者如何感知语音。发音语音学研究的则是声道如何发出语音，这也是本章的主题。,Acoustic phonetics focuses on the physical properties of sounds; auditory phonetics is concerned with how listeners perceive these sounds; and articulatory phonetics—the primary concern of this chapter—is the study of how the vocal tract produces the sounds of language.
8691,在布莱希特和卢卡奇为现实主义争论不休的同时，法兰克福学派的马克思主义美学却彻底地丢弃了现实主义。,"While Brecht and Lukács held conflicting views of realism, the Frankfurt School of Marxist aesthetics rejected realism altogether."
8691,法兰克福的社会研究所实践所谓的“批评理论”，这种理论是一种以黑格尔式的马克思主义为基础并包括了弗洛伊德成分的范围广泛的社会分析形式。,"The Institute for Social Research at Frankfurt practised what it called ‘Critical Theory’, which was a wide-ranging form of social analysis grounded in Hegelian Marxism and including Freudian elements."
8691,这派理论在哲学与美学中的主要人物是马克斯·霍克海默（Max Horkheimer）、泰奥多尔·阿多诺（Theodor Adorno）和赫伯特·马尔库塞（Herbert Marcuse）。,"The leading figures in philosophy and aesthetics were Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno and Herbert Marcuse."
8692,强力诗人们分别或连续采用六种心理防范形式来对付那种“影响的焦虑”（ anxiety of influence）。,Strong poets cope with the ‘anxiety of influence’ by adopting separately or successively six psychic defences.
8692,这些形式以比喻的形式出现在他们的诗歌中，使他们可以从父辈的诗歌中“转脱”出来。,These appear in their poetry as tropes which allow a poet to ‘swerve’ from a father’s poems.
8692,这六种比喻是：反讽、提喻、换喻、夸张/反语、隐喻、再换喻（metalepsis）。,"The six tropes are irony, synecdoche, metonymy, hyperbole/litotes, metaphor and metalepsis."
8693,代词有不同的类型。,There are different types of pronouns.
8693,反身代词是指 himself(他自己）和 themselves(他们自己）这样的代词。,Reflexive pronouns are pronouns such as himself and themselves.
8693,在英语中，反身代词总是通过回指同一个小句中的 NP 先行语而获得语义，如下例所示（下画线表示反身代词冋指 NP ) ：(1)Jane bit herself.,"In English, reflexive pronouns always depend on an NP antecedent for their meaning and the antecedent must be in the same clause, as illustrated in the following examples:1."
8693,(篮咬了她自己。,Jane bit herself.
8693,)(2)*Jane said that Bill bit herself.(*简说比尔咬了她自己。,2. *Jane said that the boy bit herself.
8693,)(3)*Herself left.(*她自己离开了。）,3.  *Herself left.
8694,词以多种多样的方式在语义上相互联系。,Words are semantically related to one another in a variety of ways.
8694,描述这些关系的词经常是以黏着语素-nym结尾的。,The words that describe these relations often end in the bound morpheme -nym.
8694,人们最了解的词汇关系是同义词，以上爱德华•李尔的诗就是一个例子，此外还有反义词和对立词。,"The best- known lexical relations are synonyms, illustrated in the poem by Edward Lear, and antonyms or opposites."
8695,有些词是它们自己的反义词。,Some words are their own antonyms.
8695,这些“自反义词” 是这样一些词：例如cleave(切开/黏住)和dust (擦掸/撒扬)，后者可分别用在dusting furniture (擦拭/掸除家具上的灰尘)和dusting crops(扬谷)。,"These “autoantonyms” or “contranyms” are words such as cleave “to split apart” or “to cling together” and dust “to remove something” or “to spread something,” as in dusting furniture or dusting crops."
8695,拼写不同但是发音一样的反义词对和自反义词类似：raise(种植，喂养，募集)和raze(拆毁，抹除)就是这样一个词对。,Antonymic pairs that are pronounced the same but spelled differently are similar to autoantonyms: raise and raze are one such pair.
8696,当我们面对一页混乱不堪的形象时，我们选择归化的做法，是把这些形象看作是一个精神紊乱的头脑的产物，或者说它们是一个混乱世界的反映，而不会接受这堆混乱，说它们是陌生的、不可解的东西。,"When faced with a page of apparently random images, we prefer to naturalize it by attributing the images to a disordered mind or by regarding it as a reﬂection of a disordered world, rather than to accept its disorder as strange and inexplicable."
8696,形式主义者注意到文本拒绝接受无情的归化过程的那些性质，从而启示了结构主义和后结构主义思潮。,The Formalists anticipated structuralist and poststructuralist thought by attending to those features of texts which resist the relentless process of naturalization.
8696,什克洛夫斯基拒绝把《商第传》那奇特的紊乱简单地归结为商第古怪思想的表达，相反，却引导读者注意小说那阻止了归化的反复出现的文学性。,"Shklovsky refused to reduce the bizarre disorder of Tristram Shandy to an expression of Tristram’s quirky mind, and instead drew attention to the novel’s insistent literariness which checks naturalization."
8697,从语言学的意义上来说，没有一种语言或语言变体(称为方言)要比其他语言或语言变体来得优越。,No language or variety of a language (called a dialect) is superior to any other in a linguistic sense.
8697,每一部语法都同样复杂，同样具有逻辑性，同样能生成无限多的句子，来表达任何思想。,"Every grammar is equally complex, logical, and capable of producing an infinite set of sentences to express any thought."
8697,如果某事能够用一种语言或方言表达，那么，它也能用其他任何一种语言或方言来表达。,"If something can be expressed in one language or one dialect, it can be expressed in any other language or dialect."
8698,前面提到，塞音是非通音。,Stops and affricates belong to the class of noncontinuants.
8698,发非通音时空气在中完全阻断。,There is a total obstruction of the airstream in the oral cavity.
8698,还包括鼻塞音(虽然空气从鼻子里无间断地流出)和塞擦音。,Nasal stops are included although air does flow continuously out the nose.
8699,使用外接缀的语言中，人们更为熟悉是德语。,An example of a more familiar circumfixing language is German.
8699,德语规则动词的过去分词，是通过在动词词根加上前缀ge-和后缀-t构成的。,The past participle of regular verbs is formed by adding the prefix ge- and the suffix -t to the verb root.
8699,给动词词根lieb ( 爱）加上这样的外接缀，就会生成geliebt ( 动词“爱”的过去分词，或者用作形容词，意为“心爱的”）。,"This circumfix added to the verb root lieb “love” produces geliebt, “loved” (or “beloved,” when used as an adjective)."
8700,分立系统假说认为，双语儿童为每种语言分别建立了词库和语法。,The separate systems hypothesis says that the bilingual child builds a distinct lexicon and grammar for each language.
8700,为了检验分类系统假说，就必须调查儿童如何习得两种语言在语法上不同的部分。例 如，如果两种语言中都有“主一动一宾”(SVO)词序，那么它就不适合用来检验该假说。,"To test the separate systems hypothesis, it is necessary to look at how the child acquires those pieces of grammar that are different in his two languages.For example, if both languages have SVO word order, this would not be a good place to test this hypothesis."
8701,心理语言学研究也关注句法处理。,Psycholinguistic research has also focused on syntactic processing.
8701,除了识别词以外，听话人还必须判定句子中词和短语之间的句法和语义关系，这就是我们前面所称的“分析”。对句子的分析主要是由语法规则决定的，但语言的序列性特征也有很大影响。,"In addition to recognizing words, the listener must figure out the syntactic and semantic relations among the words and phrases in a sentence, what we earlier referred to as“parsing.”The parsing of a sentence is largely determined by the rules of the grammar, but it is also strongly influenced by the sequential nature of language."
8702,对于大多数句子来说，笼统判断它们的真假是没有意义的。,For most sentences it does not make sense to say that they are always true or always false.
8702,在一定程度上，它们的真假要视给定情景而定，就像我们之前看到的“杰克游泳”这个句子一样。,"Rather, they are true or false in a given situation, as we previously saw with Jack swims."
8702,但是有少量的句子永远是真的，无论你是在何种情景下说出来。,But a restricted number of sentences are indeed always true regardless of the circumstances.
8702,这种句子叫作同义反复(“分析的”这一术语也用来指此类句子)。,They are called tautologies.(The term analytic is also used for such sentences.)
8702,同义反复的例子如“圆圈是圆的”或“单身的人没结婚”。,Examples of tautologies are sentences like Circles are round or A person who is single is not married.
8703,拉康的弗洛伊德主义鼓励现代批评放弃那种认为语言能够指涉事物、表达思想感情的信念。,Lacan’s Freudianism has encouraged modern criticism to abandon faith in language’s power to refer to things and to express ideas or feelings.
8703,现代主义文学由于逃避叙述规则控制的立场和对意义的自由嬉戏往往和梦类似。,Modernist literature often resembles dreams in its avoidance of a governing narrative position and its free play of meaning.
8703,拉康自己曾写过一篇讨论爱伦·坡的《失窃的信》的文章，这篇文章引起了广泛的关注和讨论。,Lacan himself wrote a much discussed analysis of Poe’s ‘The Purloined Letter’.
8704,克里斯蒂娃的著作（见第7章）常常把“封闭的”理性系统和“开放的”、断裂的“非理性”系统的两极作为自己的核心观念。,"Kristeva’s work (see also Chapter 7, pp. 161–2) has frequently taken as its central concept a polarity between ‘closed’, rational systems and ‘open’, disruptive, ‘irrational’ systems."
8704,她把诗歌作为分析的“特许场地”，因为诗歌在这两种体系之间保持平衡，还因为在某一时期，诗歌向欲望与恐惧的根本冲动开放，而欲望与冲动总是在“理性”的控制之外的。,"She has considered poetry to be the ‘privileged site’ of analysis, because it is poised between the two types of system, and because at certain times poetry has opened itself to the basic impulses of desire and fear which operate outside the ‘rational’ systems."
8704,她对“符号的”与“象征的”做了重要区分，这种区分成了许多其他极端的先驱。,Her important distinction between the ‘semiotic’ and the ‘symbolic’ is the progenitor of many other polarities.
8705,要把结构主义和符号学区別开来并不是件容易的事。符号学是一门研究标志符号的通用科学，它的起源可以追溯到索绪尔和美国哲学家查尔斯·桑德斯·皮尔斯（Charles Sanders Peirce)。,"It is not easy to distinguish structuralism from semiotics, the general science of signs, which traces its lineage to Saussure and the American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce."
8705,符号学是一种国际流派，它试图吸收有关行为和交际的科学研究，同时主要回避其法语中和有关译本中标志结构主义的哲学思辨和文化批评。,"Semiotics, though, is an international movement that has sought to incorporate the scientific study of behaviour and communication, while mostly avoiding the philosophical speculation and cultural critique that has marked structuralism in its French and related versions."
8706,辅音性最弱的是滑音，但同时滑音也不像元音，程度仅次于阻音。,Glides are even referred to as “semivowels” or “semi-consonants” in some books.
8706,语言学家看到这些性质渐变的情况，把阻音、流音、鼻音归入辅音下的一个次类，成为纯辅音。滑音不够条件，不是纯辅音，当然也不是元音。,"In recognition of this fact linguists place the obstruents, nasal stops, and liquids in a subclass of conso- nants called consonantal, from which the glides are excluded."
8707,,By 1500
8707,到了公元前1500年，他们发明了一种由22个语符组成的文字系统，又称西闪语音节表。,"b.c.e., they had developed a writing system of twenty-two characters, the West Semitic Syllabary."
8707,音节表中的大部分语符只代表辅音，元音及音节的其余部分则由读者通过自己的语言知识来补上（如 Cn y rd ths？,"Mostly, the characters stood for consonants alone.The reader provided the vowels, and hence the rest of the syllable, through knowledge of the language.(Cn y rd ths?)"
8707,)。因此，西闪语音节表既是一个音节表，又是一个辅音字母表。,Thus the West Semitic Syllabary was both a syllabary and a consonantal alphabet (also called abjad).
8708,很多亚洲语言如汉语普通话、緬甸语、泰语都是声调语言。,"Many languages of Asia, such as Mandarin Chinese, Burmese, and Thai, are tone languages."
8708,例如泰语中同一串音段[na:]，可以加上低调、中调、高调、降调、升调，意思都不一样。,"In Thai, for example, the same string of segmental sounds represented by [na:] will mean different things if one says the sounds with a low pitch, a midpitch, a high pitch, a falling pitch from high to low, or a rising pitch from low to high."
8708,因此泰语有五个语言学声调，见下:(在下面的音标转写中用附加符号表示声调),"Thai therefore has five linguistic tones, as illustrated as follows:(Diacritics are used to represent distinctive tones in the phonetic transcriptions.)"
8709,例如: The boy is sleeping—Is the boy sleeping?,For example: The boy is sleeping.→ Is the boy __ sleeping?
8709,这一规则利用由短语结构规则生成的基本的（NP-Aux）结构，推导出第二棵树（横线代表在这个位置上的成分被移出）。,The rule takes the basic (NP-Aux) structure generated by the phrase structure rules and derives a second tree (the dash represents the position from which a constituent has been moved).
8709,Aux通过附接被连接到树上。,The Aux is attached to the tree by adjunction.
8709,附接指的是一种句法操作，即复制现有节点（在本例中就是节点S），创建一个新的层次，并把移出的范畴（在本例中就是Aux）附加到这个层次上。,Adjunction is an operation that copies an existing node (in this case S) and creates a new level to which the moved category (in this case Aux) is appended.
8710,他划分了三种“基本类型”，分别称之为“专用名词”、“形容词”和“动词”。,"He isolates three ‘primary categories’ which he calls ‘proper name’, ‘adjective’ and ‘verb’."
8710,第一类代表人物，而从情节结构的观点看，它们纯属各个命题的主语，本身没有任何内在属性。,The first represent characters and from the point of view of plot structure are simply subjects of propositions without any internal properties.
8710,形容词与格莱麦的“修饰语”和克利斯蒂瓦的“限定性附属成分”类似，又进一步划分为状态（即对立的变体，幸福／不幸福），属性（美德／缺陷）和条件（男性／女性，犹太教／基督教，出身高贵／出身低贱）。,"Adjectives, analogous to Greimas’s ‘qualifications’ and Kristeva’s ‘qualifying adjuncts’, are divided into states (variants of the opposition happy/unhappy), properties (virtues/faults) and conditions (male/ female, Jewish/Christian, of high/low birth)."
8711,在英文里，一个复合字通常中间有一个‘-’或直接把两个字连在一起，不过有的时候也可以把它拼成两个独立的字，中间有空格。,"In English, a compound is often spelled with a hyphen or by running its two words together, but it can also be spelled with a space between the two components as if they were still separate words."
8711,这使得你的文法老师搞不清了，她告诉你Yugoslavia report中，Yugoslavia是个形容词。,"This confused your grammar teacher into telling you that in ""Yugoslavia report"", ''Yugoslavia'' is an adjective."
8711,你只要把这个跟真正的形容词interesting一比之下就知道老师说的不可能是对的。,
8711,,"To see that this can't be right, just try comparing it with a real adjective like ""interesting""."
8712,他接着阐明了自己的定义。“要在内心唤起以前体验过的一种感觉，唤起之后，要以别人可能体验到相同感情的方式来交流这种感觉……从而别入受到这些感觉的感染井且亲身经历它们。艺术活动即存在于此.,"He  then  sets  out  his  own  experienced  before,  and  having  evoked  it  in  oneself,  to  communicate this sensation in such a way that others may experience the same sensation . . . so that other men are infected by these sensations and pass through them; in this does the activity of Art consist.’"
8713,艺术的特殊任务正是要唤醒我们的意识，使我们重新认识到那些已经在日常意识中变得司空见惯的事物。,It is the special task of art to give us back the awareness of things which have become habitual objects of our everyday awareness.
8713,必须强调的是，形式主义者与浪漫主义诗人不同，他们感兴趣的并不是感觉本身，而是那些能够产生“陌生化”技巧的性质。,"It must be stressed that the Formalists, unlike the Romantic poets, were not so much interested in the perceptions themselves as in the nature of the devices which produce the effect of ‘defamiliarization’."
8713,艺术品的目的是改变我们的感觉方式，使我们的感觉从自动的、实际的转变成艺术的。,The purpose of a work of art is to change our mode of perception from the automatic and practical to the artistic.
8714,现象学另一种面向读者的说法叫作“感受的美学”（汉斯·罗伯特·姚斯）。,Another reader-oriented version of phenomenology is called ‘aesthetics of reception’ (Hans Robert Jauss).
8714,一部作品是对一个“期望视域”提出的问题的答复。,A work is an answer to questions posed by a ‘horizon of expectations’.
8714,因此对作品的理解就不应该集中在某个具体读者的经验上，而应集中在人们对作品的感受历史上，集中在这部作品与不断变化的美学标准和一系列期待值的关系上，正是这些使作品能在不同的时代得以流传。,"The interpretation of works should, therefore, focus not on the experience of an individual reader but on the history of a work’s reception and its relation to the changing aesthetic norms and sets of expectations that allow it to be read in different eras."
8715,不过，这种方法似乎至少会遇到两大障碍。,But there seem at least two important obstacles.
8715,首先在语句这一层次上。我们知道，格的语法形式与格莱麦的方法相类似，格能与一组名词性成分按照各种逻辑构成一个语句的谓语，但是，关于格的语法关系的争论表面，如果我们要再现语句成分之间的关系，没有相当程度的实验，所需行为角色的数目是无法确定的。,"First of all, at the level of the sentence itself, the debates concerning case grammar, which is formally analogous to Greimas’s approach in that it makes the sentence a predicate with a constellation of nominals in various logical slots, show that the number of the actantial roles that are required if one is to represent the relations among sentence constituents cannot be determined without considerable empirical experimentation."
8716,在1935年写的文章中，雅可布森提出了“主导成分”（dominant）的概念，他称“主导成分”是艺术品聚焦的部分：它统领、决定并改变其他部分。“主导成分”成了后期形式主义的一个重要概念。,"Writing in 1935, Jakobson regarded ‘the dominant’ as an important late Formalist concept, and defined it as ‘the focusing component of a work of art: it rules, determines and transforms the remaining components’."
8716,雅可布森正确地强调了考察艺术结构时的非机械论观点。,He rightly stresses the non-mechanistic aspect of this view of artistic structure.
8716,“主导成分”给作品提供了一个结晶化的聚合点，为使它成为一个统一体或者格式塔（完全有序的形式）提供了便利。,The dominant provides the work with its focus of crystallization and facilitates its unity or gestalt (total order).
8717,哲学家T.S.库恩说明，科学中出现的“事实”取决于科学观察者给予理解对象一个什么样的指涉框架。,T. S. Kuhn has shown that what emerges as a ‘fact’ in science depends upon the frame of reference which the scientific observer brings to the object of understanding.
8717,格式塔心理学争辩说，人类心灵只能把世界上的事物感知为由种种因素、主旨构成的形体，或者有意义的、构筑好的整体，而不能把它们感知为毫无关联的散乱的碎片。,"Gestalt psychology argues that the human mind does not perceive things in the world as unrelated bits and pieces but as configurations of elements, themes, or meaningful, organized wholes."
8717,单个的事物在不同的环境中呈现出不同的形貌，即使在同 一个观察的环境中，由于被看作“形体”或“根基”的不同也会获得不同的解释。,"Individual items look different in different contexts, and even within a single field of vision they will be interpreted according to whether they are seen as ‘figure’ or ‘ground’."
8718,像许多语言一样，俄语中有格标记，它是语法语素，放在名词后面表示这个名词是主语、宾语、领有者或者是其他语法角色。,The grammatical relation of a noun in a sentence is called the case of the noun.
8718,正如在前面的例子所示，-a是宾格（指宾语）的格标记，同时它也可以表不属格（指所有），比如，mjech’Viktor+a意思是“维克多的剑”。,"When case is marked by inflectional morphemes, the process is referred to as case morphology."
8718,Vicktor+u是与格，意思是“给维克多”，Viktor+om意思是“由维克多”，Viktor+je意思是“关于维克多”。,"Russian has a rich case morphology, whereas English case morphology is limited to the one possessive -s and to its system of pronouns."
8718,很多语法关系俄语都用格形态表示，英语则用介词表示。,Many of the grammatical relations that Russian expresses with its case morphology are expressed in English with prepositions.
8719,这些不同反映在选词、发音和语法规则方面。,"These differences are reflected in word choices, the pronunciation of words, and grammatical rules."
8719,说话者个人的语言特征被称为该说话者的个人方言。,The language of an individual speaker with its unique characteristics is referred to as the speaker’s idiolect.
8719,因此可以说，英语也就是由4.5亿到8.5亿种个人方言所组成的语言，或者说，英语方言的数量和讲英语的人数相等（该数量好像每天都在增长，很难估算具体人数）。,"English may then be said to consist of anywhere from 450 million to 850 million idiolects, or the number of speakers of English (which seems to be growing every day and is difficult to estimate)."
8720,此时，他们的语言比成人语言更加规则。,Now their language is more regular than the adult language.
8720,在阶段3中，儿童知道规则有例外，所以再次使用brought和broke这些正确的形式。与阶段1的情况不同的是，此时这些不规则形式会与根形式联系起来。,"During phase 3 the child learns that there are exceptions to the rule, and then once again uses brought and broke, with the difference being that these irregular forms will be related to the root forms."
8721,这种观点明显和功利主义有着密切关系。,This  view  plainly  has  close  connections  with  Utilitarianism.
8721,其实边沁著作的编者对其大师学说的解释倘若可以确信的话，那么这就是边沁要传授的思想，“和快乐最近于同义的名词‘自愿’：凡事做了令人快乐，无非是人愿意做的事……。,"In  fact  if Bentham’s editor is to be trusted in his interpretation of his master’s doctrine, it  would  be  what  Bentham  intended  to  teach.‘The  term  nearest  to  being synonymous with pleasure is volition: what it pleases a man to do is simply what he wills to do."
8721,"人所愿意做的事情,或者人所乐而为之的事情，可能远远没有给他带来乐趣，不过我们可不可以说人在做的时候并非自得其乐呢？",". . . What a man wills to do, or what he pleases to do, may be far from giving him enjoyment; yet shall we say that in doing it, he is not following his own pleasure?"
8722,文学产品同样具有多种功能。,The same variability of function can be seen in literary products.
8722,一篇政治讲演、一篇传记、一封信和一件宣传品在不同的社会和时代可能有审美功能，也可能没有审美功能。,"A political speech, a biography, a letter and a piece of propaganda may or may not possess aesthetic value in different societies and periods."
8722,“艺术”范畴的周边界限总是在变化着，而且总是与某种社会结构发生着动态的关联。,"The circumference of the sphere of ‘art’ is always changing, and always dynamically related to the structure of society."
8723,同时或稍晚， 20世纪英语文学的主要作家们——叶芝、艾略特、庞德、劳伦斯、乔伊斯——正在发展他们自己的封闭的象征体系。在这些体系中，传统、通灵学、男性和女性原则、中世纪的爱好以及神话将为一些完整的“共时”结构——一些用以控制和解释历史实在的无所不包的模式——奠定基石。,"At about the same time, or a little later, the major writers of twentieth-century English literature — Yeats, Eliot, Pound, Lawrence, Joyce — were developing their own closed symbolic systems, in which Tradition, theosophy, the male and female principles, medievalism and mythology were to provide the keystones of complete 'synchronic' structures, exhaustive models for the control and explanation of historical reality."
8723,索绪尔自己则将假定成为语言系统基础的“集体意识”的存在。,Saussure himself was to posit the existence of a 'collective consciousness' underlying the system of langue.
8724,这里我对英文可能有些不公平。,But I have been a bit unfair to English.
8724,"英文在构词变化上是有些粗糙,名词只有加-s，动词只有加-ed来表示复数或过去式而已。","English is genuinely crude in its ''inflectional'' morphology, where one modifies a word to fit the sentence, like marking a noun for the plural with -s or a verb for past tense with -ed."
8724,"但是英文也有一些由原有的词制造出新词的构词规则，例如-able这个语尾变化，在learnable，teachable和huggable等字中,表示动词的 “做X”可以转变成形容词，意指“可以让X去做它”，大多数人都因为英文中有这么多的衍生语尾变化而吃惊。","But English holds its own in ''derivational'' morphology, where one creates a new word out of an old one.For example, the suffix -able, as in ""learnable"", ""teachable"", and ""huggable"", converts a verb meaning ''to do X'' into an adjective meaning ''capable of having X done to it."" Most people are surprised to learn how many derivational suffixes there are in English."
8725,有的语言和其它现存语言没有明显的谱系关系，它们被称为孤立语言。,Some languages have no demonstrable genealogical relationship with other living languages.They are called language isolates.
8725,例如西班牙和法国边境比利牛斯山脉居民所讲的巴斯克语，以及日本的北海道居民所讲的阿伊努语，都属于前文提及的大约四十种孤立民族语之列。,"Basque, spoken in the Pyrenees Mountains between Spain and France, and Ainu, spoken on the island of Hokkaido, Japan, are among the forty or so isolates mentioned in the Ethnologue."
8725,就目前的研究程度而言，许多手势语就属于孤立语言。,"Many sign languages, insofar as it can be determined, are isolates."
8726,比如说，关于如何理解历史的本质的讨论就一直把理解一个故事应该包括什么作为模式。,"For instance, discussions of the nature of historical understanding have taken as a model what is involved in understanding a story."
8726,明显的特点是：史学家不会对历史做出像科学领域中的那种具有预言性的解释。他们无法说明当x和y出现时，肯定会出现 z。,"Characteristically, historians do not produce explanations that are like the predictive explanations of science: they cannot show that when X and Y occur, Z will necessarily happen."
8726,他们所能做的只是说明一件事是如何导至另一件事的，说明第一次世界大战因何而爆发，而不能说明它为什么一定要爆发。,"What they do, rather, is to show how one thing led to another, how the First World War came to break out, not why it had to happen."
8727,热拉尔·热奈特(参见第4章)和许多其他人的看法是，故事/话语的区分是站不住脚的。,"As has been demonstrated by Gérard Genette (see Chapter 4, pp. 71–2) and many others, the histoire/discours distinction does not hold water."
8727,且看乔治·爱略特的《米德尔马奇》第一章开头的句子：“布鲁克小姐有着那种类型的美貌，仿佛是被破衣烂衫抛入浮雕中似的。”,Take the first sentence of the first chapter of George Eliot’s Middlemarch: ‘Miss Brooke had that kind of beauty which seems to be thrown into relief by poor dress.’
8728,另一类对立涉及下面这样的词对：  give/receive  buy/sell  teacher/pupil给予/得到   买/卖   教师/学生这些词称为关系对立词，它们表现出意义上的对称。,"Another kind of opposite involves pairs like give/receive buy/sell teacher/pupil.They are called relational opposites, and they display symmetry in their meaning."
8728,如果X把Y“给予”了Z，那么Z就从X“得到”了 Y;如果X是Y的“教师”，那么Y就是X的“学生”。,"If X gives Y to Z, then Z receives Y from X. If X is Y’s teacher, then Y is X’s pupil."
8728,以-er和-ee结尾的词对通常是关系对立词。,Pairs of words ending in -er and -ee are usually relational opposites.
8728,如果玛丽是比尔的employer(雇主)，那么比尔就是玛丽的 employee(雇员）。,"If Mary is Bill’s employer, then Bill is Mary’s employee."
8729,对于以上每个例句，说话者都可以通过增加另一个形容词、介词短语或者关系小句，把句子继续造下去。,"In each case the speaker could continue creating sentences by adding another adjective, prepositional phrase, or relative clause."
8729,原则上，句子可以永远这样造下去。,"In principle, this could go on forever."
8729,所有语言都有这样一种机制，可以生成无限量的句子。,All languages have mechanisms of this sort that make the number of sentences limitless.
8730,它们受到检验的方式很少用以检验文学的其它形式，它们的效果受到内行人士的注视，而这些人的生计 就取决于他们判断力的准确性，它们属于对趣味方面出现的情况所能获得的最佳指数。,"They are tested in a way which few other forms of literature are tested, their effects are watched by adepts whose livelihood depends upon the accuracy of their judgement, and they are among the best indices available of what is happening to taste."
8730,一旦能够表明一则广告可能有利可图而又不流于粗俗，批评就能像一门应用科学那样证明自身的合理存在。,Criticism will justify itself as an applied science when it is able to indicate how an advertisement may be profitable without necessarily being crass.
8730,我们将在下文看到，通俗性与可能产生的高度价值在哪些条件下是可以兼而有之的。,We shall see later under what conditions popularity and possible high value are compatible.
8731,这的确是一个至关重要的问题。因为从迄今为止的叙述来看，反讽归化似乎提出了比它所否定的意义更为堂皇的见解。,"This is indeed a crucial question, for from the description offered so far it might seem as though ironic naturalization makes more grandiose claims than the things which it deflates."
8731,此刻，当我们提出，一部文本其实是不同于它的字面意义的另一种东西，那么，我们就引出了作为保证我们获得真正文本的阐释方法的模式，这些模式建立在我们对文本和世界的种种期待的基础之上。,"At the moment when we propose that a text means something other than what it appears to say we introduce, as hermeneutic devices which are supposed to lead us to the truth of the text, models which are based on our expectations about the text and the world."
8732,无论过去还是现在，认为一切语法平等 ，并非所有语法学家的共同观点。,"Not all grammarians, past or present, share the view that all grammars are equal."
8732,从古到今，“纯语主义者”一直坚信，一种语言的某些说法要优于另一些说法，存在着所有受过教育的人说话和写作都必须遵循的“正确”形式，而语言演变是一种堕落。,"Language “purists” of all ages believe that some versions of a language are better than others, that there are certain “correct” forms that all educated people should use in speaking and writing, and that language change is corruption."
8732,公元1世纪亚历山大时期的希腊人、公元8世纪巴士拉城的阿拉伯学者，以及18、19 世纪众多的英语语法学家，都持这种观点。,"The Greek Alexandrians in the first century, the Arabic scholars at Basra in the eighth century, and numerous English grammarians of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries held this view."
8732,他们希望规定而不是描写语法规则，这就使得人们开始编撰规定语法。,"They wished to prescribe rather than describe the rules of grammar, which gave rise to the writing of prescriptive grammars."
8733,美国南方代表了美国英语的一个主要方言区。,The southern United States represents a major dialect area of American English.
8733,例 如，在非南方英语中带有双元音 [aj]的词在南方通常发单元音 [a:]。,"For example, words pronounced with the diphthong [aɪ] in non-Southern English will usually be pronounced with the monophthong [aː] in the South."
8733,因此，1996年亚特兰大奥运会期间，你也许听到当地电台或电视播音员说运动员去[ha:]“high”jump(跳高)，当地居民也会邀请来客尝一尝佐治亚州著名的碧根果[pa:]“pie”(馅饼）。,"Local radio and TV announcers at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta called athletes to the [haː] “high” jump, and local natives invited visitors to try Georgia’s famous pecan [paː] “pie.”"
8733,这两种方言之间[aj]—[a:]的对应说明了规则的语音对应；当非南方方言中的一个词带 [aj]时，南方方言则用[a:]，所有这样的词都是如此。,"The [aɪ]-[aː] correspondence of these two dialects is an example of a regular sound correspondence.When [aɪ] occurs in a word in non-Southern dialects, [aː] occurs in the Southern dialect, and this is true for all such words."
8734,我们知道所有的儿童都以相似的方式看待世界，并运用同样的普遍原则来帮助他们确定词义。,We know that all children view the world in a similar fashion and apply the same general principles to help them determine a word’s meaning.
8734,比如，过度扩展常常基于大小、形状和质地等物理特征。,"For example, overextensions are usually based on physical attributes such as size, shape, and texture."
8734,ball(球)这个词可以指称所有圆形的东西，bunny(小兔子)可以指称所有毛茸茸的东西，等等。,
8734,,"Ball may refer to all round things, bunny to all furry things, and so on."
8735,"《神曲》就是一个代表性的例证,一些学养有素的读者能够运用想象再现阿奎那的世界观，以及对待妇女和贞操的某些态度，它们甚至更加无从接触和理会，对于这类读者来说确乎根本不存在过时问题。","The Divina Commedia is a representative example.It is true that for adequately equipped readers who can imaginatively reproduce the world outlook of Aquinas, and certain attitudes to woman and to chastity, which are even more inaccessible, there is no obsolescence."
8735,但是大多数无人问津的诗篇确实落入如此境地。,But this is true of the most forgotten poems.
8735,一般而论，客观的过时现象并非价值不高的一个标记，而仅仅是运用特殊环境进行交流的标记。,"Actual obsolescence is not in general a sign of low value, but merely of the use of special circumstances for communication."
8736,例句4、5、6中所涉及的过程在英语中相当普遍。,"The processes that are involved in examples 4, 5, and 6 are quite common in English."
8736,例如，“I disapprove of John's cooking”（我反对约翰做饭）这句活可能意指，我认为他的妻子应该做饭;或者意指，我认为他大蒜用得太多。,"Thus, the sentence “I disapprove of John’s cooking” may imply either that I think his wife should cook or that I think he uses too much garlic, for example."
8736,如果我们用句5和句6所表明的方式来扩展这句话，那么，这种含糊性就得以解除了。,
8736,,"Again, the ambiguity is resolved if we extend the sentence in the manner indicated in 5 and 6."
8737,然而，如果我们所提出的一条英语规则，与你作为说英语者的语感不相符合，那么，我们所描写的语法，便以某种方式有别于代表你语言能力的那部心 理语法；也就是说，你的语言与我们所描写的语言不是一回事。,"If, however, we posit a rule for English that does not agree with your intuitions as a speaker, then the grammar we are describing differs in some way from the mental grammar that represents your linguistic competence; that is, your lan-guage is not the one described."
8737,从语言学的意义上来说，没有一种语 言或语言变体（称为方言）要比其他语言或语言变体来得优越。,No language or variety of a language (called a dialect) is superior to any other in a linguistic sense.
8737,每一部语法都同样复杂，同样具有逻辑性，同样能生成无限多的句子，来表达任何思想 。,"Every grammar is equally complex, logical, and capable of producing an infinite set of sentences to express any thought."
8738,这种分配性关系也可以分为两类。,These distributional relations are of two kinds.
8738,横组合关系影响组合的可能性：两个单元可能是互换或非互换关系，也可能是相容或不相容关系。,"Syntagmatic relations bear on the possibility of combination: two items may be in a relation of reciprocal or non-reciprocal implication, compatibility or incompatibility."
8738,纵组合关系决定替换的可能性，在对一个系统进行分析时尤为重要。,"Paradigmatic relations, which determine the possibility of substitution, are especially important in the analysis of a system."
8739,一旦结构主义被定义为一种流派或一个学派，理论家们便和它拉升了距离。,"Once structuralism came to be deﬁned as a movement or school, theorists distanced themselves from it."
8739,越来越淸楚，那些所谓的结构主义者的著作并不符合旨在掌握结构并使其系统化的结构主义的观点。,It became clear that works by alleged structuralists did not ﬁt the idea of structuralism as an attempt to master and codify structures.
8739,巴特、拉康和福柯等人被看作是后结构主义者。,"Barthes, Lacan, and Foucault, for example, were identiﬁed as post-structuralists, who had gone beyond structuralism narrowly conceived."
8739,他们已经超出了狭义的结构主义的定义，即使在这些思想家的早期作品中就已经清楚地显现出许多与后结构主义一致的立场了，那时，他们还被认为是结构主义者。,But many positions associated with post-structuralism are evident even in the early work of these thinkers when they were seen as structuralists.
8740,20世纪70年代后期，后结构主义思潮对伊格尔顿的影响造成了其著作的巨大变化。,The impact of poststructuralist thought produced a radical change in Eagleton’s work in the late 1970s.
8740,他开始从阿尔都塞的“科学”态度转向布莱希特和本雅明的革命思想。,His attention shifted from the ‘scientific’ attitude of Althusser towards the revolutionary thought of Brecht and Benjamin.
8740,这一变化把伊格尔顿又跑回到《费尔巴哈论纲》（1845）的经典马克思主义革命理论的轨道上：“客观真理能否归属于人类思维不是一个理论问题，而是一个实际问题。……哲学家仅仅是以不同的方式解释了世界；而重要的是改变它。”,This shift had the effect of throwing Eagleton back towards the classic Marxist revolutionary theory of the Theses on Feuerbach (1845): ‘The question whether objective truth can be attributed to human thinking is not a question of theory but is a practical question. . . . The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it.’
8741,词义相反的词就是反义词。,Words that are opposite in meaning are antonyms.
8741,反义词氛围几种。,There are several kinds of antonymy.
8741,一种是互补反义词对：alive/dead present/absent awake/asleep。,There are complementary pairs: alive/dead present/absent awake/asleep.
8741,说它们互补，是因为alive（活的）=not dead（不是死的），而dead（死的）=not alive（不是活的）。,"They are complementary in that alive = not dead and dead = not alive, and so on."
8742,在词中出现那（哪）种变体，是由前面的字母决定的。,Which variant occurs in a particular word is determined by the immediately preceding letter.
8742,当前面的字幕像g那样，在底线收笔的时候，就出现在底线起笔的那个变体；当前面的字幕像b那样，在中线收笔的时候，就出现中线起笔的那个变体。,The variant that begins near the bottom of the line appears after letters like g that end near the bottom of the line.The variant that begins near the middle of the line appears after letters like b that end near the middle of the line.
8742,因此l的两个变体处于互补分布之中。,The two variants of l are therefore in complementary distribution.
8743,如果图像符号与其所代表的词之间不再具有任何视觉上的联系，它便成了代表该词读音的表音文字符号。,"When a graphic sign no longer has a visual relationship to the word it represents, it becomes a phonographic symbol, standing for the sounds that represent the word."
8743,这样，一个符号就可以用来表达语言中所有读音相同的词——即同音异义词。,A single sign can then be used to represent all words with the same sounds—the homophones of the language.
8743,例如，⊙这一符号若代表英语中的sun(太阳，那么，它还可以用于像 My ⊙ is a doctor(我的儿子（son)是医生）这样的句子中。,"If, for example, the symbol ⊙ stood for sun in English, it could then be used in a sentence like My ⊙ is a doctor."
8743,这一句子便是画谜原理的一个例子。,This sentence is an example of the rebus principle.
8744,从结构主义的转向，用法国语言学家爱米尔·本维尼斯特的话来说，就是部分地从“语言”转向“话语”。,"The shift away from structuralism has been in part, to use the terms of the French linguist Emile Benveniste, a move from 'language' to 'discourse'."
8744,“语言”是被客观化看待的言语或书写形式，它被视为一条没有主体的符号链。,"'Language' is speech or writing viewed 'objectively', as a chain of signs without a subject."
8744,“话语”是作为言辞被理解的语言，包括说与写的主体，因而其潜在主体至少包括读者和听者两个群体。,"'Discourse' means language grasped as utterance,as involving speaking and writing subjects and therefore also, at least potentially, readers or listeners."
8745,后来，语言思想中发生了一个平行的运动。,"Later, a parallel movement occurred in linguistic thought."
8745,埃弥尔·本文尼斯特对故事与话语做了著名的区分，力图保留一个非主体化的语言领域的观念。,In his celebrated distinction between histoire (narrative) and discours (discourse) Emile Benveniste tried to preserve the notion of a non-subjectivized region of language.
8745,他争辩说，一个纯粹叙事性的语言（在法语小说中用“历史现在时”或“不定过去去时”为主要特征）是完全可能避免言说者的干预的。,He argued that a purely narrative use of language (characterized in French fiction by the use of the ‘past historic’ or ‘aorist’ tense) is quite devoid of intervention by the speaker.
8746,继之而来的必然是我们对待世界和同类的态度的变化。,It  is  being  inevitably  followed  by  wide changes in our attitudes to the world and to fellow-creatures.
8746,这场变化的一个趋势是走向宽容，其次是走向怀疑主义，再则是趋于更为稳妥地形成我们的行为动机。,"One current in this change is towards tolerance, another towards scepticism, a third towards far more secure founding of our motives of action."
8746,总的眼光上有时候预示着相对性（或者一旦传播开时对于它的普遍性的想法）的那些惊人的哲学上的变化，即使出现的话，看牢也许会淹没于不大醒目却又比较家常性的变化之中。,"The startling philosophical changes  in  the  general  outlook  sometimes  predicted  for  Relativity  (or  for popular  ideas  about  it  when  once  they  become  widespread)  appear  likely,  if they occur at all, to be engulfed by these more unobtrusive but more domestic changes."
8747,"在进行一个词汇联想测验时，假如你说hut(小屋），首先引发的联想应该是一串同义词、反义词和其他的替代词：cabin,hovel,palace,den ,burrow等等。","In a word-association test, if you said ‘hut’, the first type would produce a string of synonyms, antonyms, and other substitutions:‘cabin’, ‘hovel’, ‘palace’, ‘den’, ‘burrow’."
8747,"另外一类联想即是那些可以和 hut组合在一起，从而形成潜在序列的成分： burnt out（烧掉了）,is a poor little house（是一间小破房）等等。","The other type would offer elements which combine with ‘hut’, forming potential sequences: ‘burnt out’, ‘is a poor little house’."
8747,雅可布森进一步指出，这两类混乱相当于两种修辞手段隐喻和换喻。,Jakobson goes on to point out that the two disorders correspond to two figures of speech – metaphor and metonymy.
8748,有意思的是，人们现在还不清楚人类的心理分析器是否运用这种回溯策略或并行策略来处理歧义，抑或两种策略并用，或用另外的某种策略。,"Interestingly, it is not established within psycholinguistics whether the human parser uses backtracking or parallelism to deal with ambiguity, or perhaps a combination, or some alternative strategy."
8748,这对心理语言学家而言仍然是难题。,This remains a challenge for psycholinguists.
8748,而解决这个难题却是很困难的，因为人们通常很容易处理歧义，理解说话人想要表达的意义。我们现在也没有见到很多证据证明人们需要做许多额外的工作来处理其他可能的意义。,"Figuring this out is difficult because people usually handle ambiguity and arrive at the intended meaning easily, and we do not see much evidence that they are doing lots of extra work to deal with additional possible meanings."
8749,哈姆雷特正在装疯卖傻，他拒绝“如实地”回答波洛涅斯的问题。,"Hamlet, who is feigning insanity, refuses to answer Polonius’s questions “in good faith.”"
8749,他违反了某些会话的规约，或者说会话准则。,"He has violated certain conversational conventions, or maxims of conversation."
8749,最先讨论这些准则的是英国哲学家H .保罗•格莱斯，因此有时也被称为“格莱斯准则”。,These maxims were first discussed by the British philosopher H. Paul Grice and are sometimes called Gricean Maxims.
8750,新批评家勇敢地打破了伟人文学论；他们坚持，作者写作时的意图即使可以被发现，也与解释他或她的作品毫不相干。,"The New Critics broke boldly with the Great Man theory of literature, insisting that the author's intentions in writing, even if they could be recovered, were of no relevance to the interpretation of his or her text."
8750,同样，特定读者的感情反应也不应与诗的意义混为一谈：诗意味着它所意味的东西，并不在乎诗人的意图或者读者由之获得的主观感情。,"Neither were the emotional responses of particular readers to be confused with the poem's meaning: the poem meant what it meant, regardless of the poet's intentions or the subjective feelings the reader derived from it."
8750,意义是公开的和客观的，它是携刻在组成文学作品的那些语言之上；意义既不是一个去世已久的作者头脑中的某些被人假定的、幻影般的冲动，也不是一个读者可能附会到他的文字上去的武断的、一己的会解(significance)。,"Meaning was public and objective, inscribed in the very language of the literary text, not a question of some putative ghostly impulse in a long-dead author's head, or the arbitrary private significances a reader might attach to his words."
8751,在不合语法规范的失语症患者的言语中，功能词的任务表明，这类词与名词这样的实词在心理上是不同的。,The omission of function words in the speech of agrammatic aphasics shows that this class of words is mentally distinct from content words like nouns.
8751,同样的现象在获得性诵读困难中也有发现。,A similar phenomenon has been observed in acquired dyslexia.
8751,病人能够说出之前用过的语言替换词，但却不合文法，而且根本无法读懂功能词。,The patient who produced the semantic substitutions cited previously was also agrammatic and was not able to read function words at all.
8752,直到几十年前，人们还认为语言“只属于人类——其他事物未必适用”。,"Until a few decades ago, language was strictly “humans only—others need not apply.”"
8752,而现在，计算机进行语言处理已经司空见惯。,"Today, it is common for computers to process language."
8752,计算语言学是语言学和计算机科学的分支学科，研究人类语言和计算机之间的相互作用。,Computational linguistics is a subfield of linguistics and computer science that is concerned with the interactions of human language and computers.
8753,计算语音学和计算音系学关心两件事：第一件事是使用计算机程序把言语信号分析成为语音成分和音位成分。,The two sides of computational phonetics and phonology are speech recognition and speech synthesis.
8753,第二件事是把准确的信号发送到电子扬声器中，这样它就能够清晰地发出该语言的语音并将这些语音组合成语素和词。,"Speech recognition is the process of analyzing the speech signal into its component phones and phonemes, and producing, in effect, a phonetic transcription of the speech."
8753,第一件事称为言语识别，第二件事称为言语合成。,"Further processing may convert the transcription into ordinary text for output on a screen, or into words and phrases for further processing, as in a speech understanding application."
8754,就神经系统而论，我们现在想要提出的看法是每个稳定平衡都由一个确定条件组合所决定，说得恰当一些，由条件的情境所决定。,"In the case of the neural system we are trying to suggest each stable poise has been determined by a definite set, or better, context of conditions."
8754,这个情境的从属关系相当于距离固体某一面的相近性。,Membership of this context is what corresponds to nearness to a facet.
8754,情境的部分恢复促使神经系统作出的反应仿佛出现了实际上并不存在的条件，这就是记忆的基本原理。,"The partial return of the context causes the system to behave as though conditions were present which are not, and this is what is essential in memory."
8755,人们阅读不同类型的文字时的神经元活动模式提供了另外的证据。,Additional evidence regarding hemispheric specialization is drawn from Japanese readers.
8755,例如，日语有两套文字。,The Japanese language has two main writing systems.
8755,一套是假名，它以日语的语音系统为基础，每个符号对应着一个音节。,"One system, kana, is based on the sound system of the language; each symbol corresponds to a syllable."
8756,最终被揭示的是一个结构的模子，它可以被缩减成一个句子，甚至一个词。,"What will ultimately be uncovered is a structural ‘matrix’, which can be reduced to a single sentence or even a single word."
8756,这个模子只能间接地被缩减，并不实际以一个词或一个陈述出现在诗中。,The matrix can be deduced only indirectly and is not actually present as a word or statement in the poem.
8756,诗歌通过这个模子实际的种种表述，即人们熟悉的陈述、套话、引语或习俗的联想等多种形式，与这个模子联系在一起。,"The poem is connected to its matrix by actual versions of the matrix in the form of familiar statements, clichés, quotations, or conventional associations."
8756,这些表述被称作“假设纲要”(hypograms)。,These versions are called ‘hypograms’.
8757,我的意思并不是说，文学不稳定是因为价值判断具有“主观性”。,I do not mean that it is unstable because value-judgements are 'subjective'.
8757,根据这种看法，世界分为“外在于彼”的坚固事实——例如中央大车站一一和“内在于此”的任意的价值判断——例如爱吃香蕉或者认为叶芝(Yeats)之诗的语调是从防御性的威赫转为坚韧的屈从。,"According to this view, the world is divided between solid facts 'out there' like Grand Central station, and arbitrary value-judgements 'in here' such as liking bananas or feeling that the tone of a Yeats poem veers from defensive hectoring to grimly resilient resignation."
8757,事实是公开的和无可怀疑的，价值则是一己的和无缘无故的。,"Facts are public and unimpeachable, values are private and gratuitous."
8758,正如你能看见的那样，索引也许用途有限，因为它是“未经加工的”。,"A concordance, as you can see, might be of limited usefulness because of its “raw” nature."
8758,改进索引的一个方法就是使用搭配分析。,A way to refine a concordance is through collocation analysis.
8758,搭配是指两个或多个词在语料库中出现时，它们彼此间的空间距离很小。,A collocation is the occurrence of two or more words within a short space of each other in a corpus.
8759,普罗提诺在讨论人类如何感受神的流溢这个问题时，公然摒弃了把感觉当作印刻在被动心灵上的“痕迹”或“图印”的概念，代之以这样一种看法：心灵是一种行动，一种力量，它“从自身释放出光芒”投射在感知对象上。,"In discussing the human perception of the divine overflow, Plotinus explicitly rejected the concept of sensations as 'imprints' or (seal-impressions, made on a passive mind, and substituted the view of the mind as an act and power which 'gives a radiance out of its own store' to the objects of sense."
8759,关于心灵的类似比喻在“剑桥柏拉图主义者”（其实说“普罗提诺主义者”比“柏拉图主义者”更合适）的哲学中尤为流行。他们的著述华兹华斯读过，柯尔律治更是研究精深。,"Similar metaphors of mind were particularly prevalent in the philosophy of the 'Cambridge Platonists' (more Plotinists, actually, than Platonists) whom Wordsworth had read, and Coleridge had studied intensively."
8760,批评理论所必须依据的两大支柱便是价值的记述和交流的记述。,The two pillars upon which a theory of criticism  must rest are an account of value and an account of communication.
8760,我们并未充分认识我们的经验中有多大部分采取了现有的形式，因为我们是社会性动物，而且从幼年起便习惯于交流。,"We do not sufficiently realize how great a part of our experience takes the form it does, because we are social beings and accustomed to communication from infancy."
8760,我们的思维感受方式中有许多得之于父母和他人，这固然是老生常谈。,"That we acquire many of our ways of thinking and feeling from parents and others is, of course, a commonplace."
8761,经济学家追求“效用”，数理哲学家研究“点”和“时”、生物学家探索“生命原理”，他们的奋斗以及心理分析学家对“里比多”和“集体无意识”的探险都是说明问题的实例。,"The struggles of economists with ‘utility’, of mathematical philosophers with ‘points’ and ‘instants’, of biologists with ‘entelechies’, ‘and the adventures of psycho-analysts with ‘the libido’ and ‘the collective unconscious’ are instances in point."
8761,目前尤其理论心理学大多是以为我所用的态度去处理相似的怀疑对象。,At present theoretical psychology in particular is largely made up of the manipulation of similar suspects.
8761,判断的行为，表述的关系，直觉意识，直接审视，意志，感觉，臆断，接受，这些不过是为了便于论述而引入的少数几个暂时性的终极概念。,"The Act of Judgement, the relation of Presentation, Immediate Awareness, Direct Inspection, the Will, Feeling, Assumption, Acceptance, are only a few of the provisional ultimates introduced for convenience of discussion."
8761,其中有一些可能最后证明是不可缺少的，不过同时它们在严谨的人眼中无 非是方便的符号工具而巳，不能允许以此为据的理论学说与探究园地隔绝开来，而后者可能使我们大有收获。,"Some of them may in the end prove to be indispensable, but meanwhile they are not, to prudent people, more than symbolic conveniences; theories dependent upon them must not be allowed to shut off from investigation fields which may be fruitful."
8762,诠释学在德国的最新发展以“接受美学”或“接受理论”而著称。,The most recent development of hermeneutics in Germany is known as 'reception aesthetics' or 'reception theory'.
8762,"与加答默尔不同,接受理论并非心无二用地全神贯注于过去 的作品。","Unlike Gadamer, it does not concentrate exclusively on works of the past."
8762,接受理论考察读者在文学中的作用，因而是一个相当新颖的发展形态。,"Reception theory examines the reader's role in literature, and as such is a fairly novel development."
8763,我们的思想总是处在一种处境中，因此也总是历史的，尽管这个历史不是外在的、社会的，而是个人的、内向的。,"Our thinking is always in a situation and is therefore always historical, although this history is not external and social but personal and inward."
8763,汉斯-格奥尔格·伽达默尔（Hans-Georg Gadamer ）在他的《真理与方法》（1975）中把海德格尔处境的方法运用在文学理论中。他争辩说，文学作品并不是一个完成的东西、一个精心打包的意义束蹦进这个世界的；意义其实取决于解释者的历史处境。,"It was Hans-Georg Gadamer who, in Truth and Method (1975), applied Heidegger’s situational approach to literary theory.Gadamer argued that a literary work does not pop into the world as a finished and neatly parcelled bundle of meaning; rather meaning depends on the historical situation of the interpreter."
8763,伽达默尔对“接受理论”产生了影响（见下文关于尧斯的论述）。,Gadamer influenced ‘reception theory’ (see Jauss below).
8764,更大的句法范畴，比如VP，包括在对应点或节点之下所有的句法范畴和词。,"The larger syntactic categories, such as VP, consist of all the syntactic categories and words below that point, or node, in the tree."
8764,在上面的PS树中的VP包括句法范畴节点V和NP以及词found，a puppy。,"The VP in the PS tree above consists of syntactic category nodes V and NP and the words found, a, and puppy."
8764,因为a puppy可以向上追溯到节点NP，这个成分就是一个名词短语。,"Because a puppy can be traced up the tree to the node NP, this constituent is a noun phrase."
8765,尽管格雷马斯无意详尽地列举实例，但是，借助上述手段，他确实把他声称在民间传说中发现的各种独特的结构（意群）区分了出来：1.契约性结构，总的特征是，契约的建立和中止，离异和/或者重新统一等等。就如上面概括的那样。,"Although Greimas makes no attempt at an exhaustive listing, he does, by the means indicated, proceed to isolate various distinctive structures (syntagmes) which, he claims, can be discerned in folk narrative: 1 Contractual structures (syntagmes contractuels) in which the situation has the overall bearing of the establishing and breaking of contracts, alienation and/or reintegration, etc., as outlined above."
8765,2.表演性结构，包括艰难的考验，斗争，任务的执行情况等等。3.分离性结构，包括迁移、离别、到达等等。,"2 Performative structures (syntagmes performanciels) involving trials, struggles, the performance of tasks etc. 3 Disjunctive structures (syntagmes disjonctionnels) involving movement, departure, arrival etc."
8766,"不过,如果你仔细查看这些首要原则,你就会发现它们好像总能得以”解构”。它们是特定意义系统的产物, 而不是需要依附外部支持的东西，这一点可以得到证明。","But if you examine such first principles closely, you can see that they may always experience deconstruction: they can be shown to be products of a particular system of meaning, rather than what props it up from the outside."
8766,此类原则常常被它们所排斥的东西所界定：它们就是备受结构主义推崇的那种“二元对立组” 中的一部分。,First principles of this kind are commonly defined by what they exclude: they are part of the sort of 'binary opposition' beloved of structuralism.
8767,从好的方面看，语言学家提出的语法是-种解释理论。这种语法为如下事实提供一种解释（根据上面提到的理想化的思路）：一个说某种语言的人，将以某种特定的方式，而不是任何另外的方式来感知、释译、形成或者运用一段话语。,"In a good sense, the grammar proposed by the linguist is an explanatory theory; it suggests an explanation for the fact that (under the idealization mentioned) a speaker of the language in question will perceive, interpret, form, or use an utterance in certain ways and not in other ways."
8767,人们还可以寻求另外一种更加深层的解释理论。,One can also search for explanatory theories of a deeper sort.
8768,所有这一切并非没有意义。,The whole matter is not without interest.
8768,我在前面曾讲过，在17世纪的观念和今日的认知心理学及语言学之间存在着惊人的相似。,I mentioned earlier that there are striking similarities between the seventeenth-century climate of opinion and that of contemporary cognitive psychology and linguistics.
8768,其中一点恰好与解释理论的问题有关。,One point of similarity has to do with precisely this matter of explanatory theory.
8768,哲学语法与现行的生成语法很相象，它自觉地形成描述传统的反向；这种描述传统把语法学家的任务仅仅理解为记录和组织语言用法的资料，即一种自然历史。,"Philosophical grammar, very much like current generative grammar, developed in self-conscious opposition to a descriptive tradition that interpreted the task of the grammarian to be merely that of recording and organizing the data of usage–a kind of natural history."
8769,在文学研究中，这是诗歌学和解释学的对比。,"In literary studies, this is a contrast between poetics and hermeneutics."
8769,诗歌学以已经验证的意义或者效果为起点，研究它们是怎样取得的。,Poetics starts with attested meanings or effects and asks how they are achieved.
8769,（是什么使一段文字在一本小说里看起来具有讽刺意味？是什么使我们对某一个人物产生同情？为什么一首诗的结尾会显得含混不清？,(What makes this passage in a novel seem ironic? What makes us sympathize with this particular character? Why is the ending of this poem ambiguous?)
8769,）而解释学则不同，它以文本为基点，研究文本的意义，力图发现新的、更好的解释。,"Hermeneutics, on the other hand, starts with texts and asks what they mean, seeking to discover new and better interpretations."
8769,解释学模式是从法律和宗教领域中借鉴的。在这两个领域里，人们试图对具有权威性的法律文本和神圣的宗教文本加以解释，目的是对如何行动做出决定。,"Hermeneutic models come from the fields of law and religion, where people seek to interpret an authoritative legal or sacred text in order to decide how to act."
8770,3.,3.
8770,(a) Max will chase what?,(a) Max will chase what?
8770,(b) Pete has put his bone where?,(b) Pete has put his bone where?
8770,(c) You think (that) which dog loves balls?,(c) You think (that) which dog loves balls?
8770,然后 ，根据转换规则“移动wh”，wh短语被移到句子的开头。,The wh phrase is then moved to the beginning of the sentence by a transformational rule: Move wh.
8770,因为我们知道嵌套的wh短语（例如 I wonder who Mary likes 我想知道玛丽喜欢谁）是标补语短语（CPs)，我们可以推导出主句问句 (Who does Mary like ) 也是 CP，如下：CPC S                                                              然后可以把wh短语移动到句子的左边，也就是空缺的标补语（Comp)位置。,"Because embedded wh phrases (I wonder who Mary likes) are known to be complementizer phrases (CPs), we may deduce that main clause questions (Who does Mary like?) are also CPs, with the following structure (recall that C abbreviates “complementizer”):CPC SThe wh phrase moves to the empty C position at the left periphery of the sentence."
8770,因此，可以通过如下三个步骤生成wh问句。1 .,"Thus, wh questions are generated in three steps:1."
8770,短语结构规则生成CP的d-结构，wh短语在S内处于NP的位置：例句（3a) 中的直接宾语、例句（3b) 中的介词宾语和例句（3c) 中的主语。2.,The phrase structure rules generate the CP d-structure with the wh phrase occupying an NP position within the S: direct object in (3a); prepositional object in (3b); and subject in (3c).
8770,“移动Aux”规则移动助动词，附接到与S相邻的位置。3.“移动wh”规则将wh短语移动到Comp的位置。,2. Move Aux adjoins the auxiliary to S. 3. Move wh moves the wh phrase to C.
8771,对于以上每个例句，说话者都可以通过增加另一个形容词、介词短语或者关系小句，把句子继续造下去。原则上，句子可以永远这样造下去。,"In each case the speaker could continue creating sentences by adding another adjective, prepositional phrase, or relative clause.In principle, this could go on forever."
8771,所有语言都有这样一种机制，可以生成无限量的句子。,All languages have mechanisms of this sort that make the number of sentences limitless.
8771,既然事实如此，一种语言的句子就无法按照词典的格式存储在我们的头脑中。,"Given this fact, the sentences of a language cannot be stored in a dictionary format in our heads."
8771,更确切地说，句子是由按照一定规则结合起来的离散单位所组成的。,"Rather, sentences are composed of discrete units that are combined by rules."
8771,这一规则系统解释了说话者是如何将无限的知识存储在有限的空间—— 我们的脑——之内的。,This system of rules explains how speakers can store infinite knowledge in a finite space—our brains.
8772,符号学的范围当然是极广泛的，从对动物的交流行为的研究（动物符号学〉到诸如对形体交流（人体运动学和近体学）、嗅觉符号（“气昧代码”）、美学 理论和修辞学这类指示系统的分析。,"The ﬁeld of semiotics is of course enormous, ranging from the study of the communicative behaviour of animals (zoosemiotics) to the analysis of such signifying systems as human bodily communication (kinesics and proxemics), olfactory signs (the ‘code of scents’), aesthetic theory, and rhetoric."
8772,大体说来，符号学的疆界（如果它有的话）和结构主义接壤：两个学科的兴趣基本上是相同的。从长远看来，两者都应被襄括在第三个容量很大的学科内。它简单地叫作交流。,"By and large, its boundaries (if it has any) are coterminous with those of structuralism: the interests of the two spheres are not fundamentally separate and, in the long run, both ought properly to be included within the province of a third, embracing discipline called, simply, communication."
8773,过去十几年中当代理论发展所引发的其他相关问题可以举证如下。,Other related effects of developments in contemporary theory over the past decades may be adduced as follows.
8773,也许最突出的例子是对既定的文学经典理念的解构。文学经典乃是典范之作，它们是从具有显著“文学价值”的“伟大作品”中遴选出来的，任何文学教育没有它们都不能达到完满之境地。,"Perhaps the most typical example has been the deconstruction of notions of a given literary canon--of an agreed selection of ‘great works’ which are the benchmark for the discrimination of‘literary value’, and without exposure to which no literary education can be complete."
8774,但精神病就要比这难对付得多，在这种情况下，自我已经不像在神经官能症的情况下那样，还能在某种程度上扼制潜意识欲望，而是在实际上已经完全为潜意识欲望所支配。,"Much more difficult to cope with, however, is the condition of psychosis, in which the ego, unable as in neurosis partly to repress the unconscious desire, actually comes under its sway."
8774,如果出现这种情况，自我与外部世界的联系就断裂了，潜意识开始建立一个替代的、妄想的现实。,"If this happens, the link between the ego and the external world is ruptured, and the unconscious begins to build up an alternative, delusional reality."
8774,换句话说，精神病患者在关键的地方与现实失去了联系，例如偏执狂和精神分裂症患者那样。神经官能症患者可能出现手臂瘫痪，而精神病患者则可能认为他的手臂已经变成一条象鼻子。,"The psychotic, in other words, has lost contact with reality at key points, as in paranoia and schizophrenia: if the neurotic may develop a paralysed arm, the psychotic may believe that his arm has turned into an elephant's trunk."
8775,但精神病就要比这难对付得多，在这种情况下，自我已经不像在神经官能症的情况下那样，还能在某种程度上扼制潜意识欲望，而是在实际上已经完全为潜意识欲望所支配。,"Much more difficult to cope with, however, is the condition of psychosis, in which the ego, unable as in neurosis partly to repress the unconscious desire, actually comes under its sway."
8775,如果出现这种情况，自我与外部世界的联系就断裂了，潜意识开始建立一个替代的、妄想的现实。,"If this happens, the link between the ego and the external world is ruptured, and the unconscious begins to build up an alternative, delusional reality."
8775,换句话说，精神病患者在关键的地方与现实失去了联系，例如偏执狂和精神分裂症患者那样。神经官能症患者可能出现手臂瘫痪，而精神病患者则可能认为他的手臂已经变成一条象鼻子。,"The psychotic, in other words, has lost contact with reality at key points, as in paranoia and schizophrenia: if the neurotic may develop a paralysed arm, the psychotic may believe that his arm has turned into an elephant's trunk."
8776,这当然不是说，焦虑、迫害恐惧以及自我分裂是从马修·向诺德到保尔·德·曼这一时代所特有的经验：整个有文字记载的历史遍布它们的踪迹。,"This is not of course to argue that anxiety, fear of persecution and the fragmentation of the self are experiences peculiar to the era from Matthew Arnold to Paul de Man: they can be found throughout recorded history."
8776,有意义的也许是，在这个时代，这类经验以一种新的方式构成了一个系统的知识领域。,What is perhaps significant is that in this period such experiences become constituted in a new way as a systematic field of knowledge.
8776,这个知识领域就是S·弗洛伊德19世纪末在维也纳发展起来的精神分析。,"That field of knowledge is known as psychoanalysis, developed by Sigmund Freud in late nineteenth- century Vienna; and it is Freud's doctrines that I now want briefly to summarize."
8777,在第三章我们讲到每个词的句法范畴都储存在我们的心理词典当中。,In chapter 3 we discussed the fact that the syntactic category of each word is listed in our mental dictionaries.
8777,我们现在可以看到这一信息是如何为一种语言的句法所使用的。,We now see how this information is used by the syntax of the language.
8777,在树形图中，词出现在标明该词句法范畴的标记之下。,Words appear in trees under labels that correspond to their syntactic category.
8777,"名词上标N, 限定词上标Det , 动词上标V, 等等。","Nouns are under N, determiners under Det, verbs under V, and so on."
8778,布罗卡区受损的病人可能患上布罗卡失语症，这是我们今天所用的命名。,"Patients with injuries to Broca’s area may have Broca’s aphasia, as it is often called today."
8778,布罗卡失语症 的特征为言语困难和某种找词困难，但主要是影响病人按句法规则造句的能力。,"Broca’s aphasia is characterized by labored speech and certain kinds of word-finding difficulties, but it is primarily a disorder that affects a person’s ability to form sentences with the rules of syntax."
8778,布罗卡失语症最显著的特点之一就是语句的语法缺失，即，语言中经常缺少冠词、介词、代词和助动词，这些被我们现在称之为“ 功能词”的词。,"One of the most notable characteristics of Broca’s aphasia is that the language produced is often agrammatic, meaning that it frequently lacks articles, prepositions, pronouns, auxiliary verbs, and other grammatical elements that we will call “function words” for now."
8779,只使用给定的句子，陈述英语较之下列语言的至少三种差异。,"State at least three differences between English and the following languages, using just the sentence(s) given."
8779,忽略词汇差异 (即不同的词汇)。,"Ignore lexical differences (i.e., the different vocabulary)."
8779,例如:泰语: dèg  khon  níi  kamlang  kin.boy  classifier this  progressive  eat“This boy is eating.”mǎa  tua  nán  kin  khâaw.dog  classifier  that  eat  rice“That dog ate rice.”,Here is an example:Thai: dèg  khon  níi  kamlang  kin.boy  classifier this  progressive  eat“This boy is eating.”mǎa  tua  nán  kin  khâaw.dog  classifier  that  eat  rice“That dog ate rice.”
8780,对语素、词、短语和句子的语言学意义的研究叫作语义学。,"The study of the linguistic meaning of morphemes, words, phrases, and sentences is called semantics."
8780,语义学的分支学科包括词汇语义学，与词的意义以及词与词之间的意义关系有关；还有 短语或句子语义学，研究的是比词大的句法单位的意义。,"Subfields of semantics are lexical semantics, which is concerned with the meanings of words, and the meaning relationships amongwords; and phrasal or sentential semantics, which is concerned with the meaning of syntactic units larger than the word."
8780,而对语境如何影响意义的研究，比如，为什么“这里很冷”这个句子在某种情景下会被解释为“把窗户关上”，则称为语用学。,"The study of how context affects meaning—for example, how the sentence It’s cold in here comes to be interpreted as “close the windows” in certain situations—is called pragmatics."
8781,不过文化研究热衷于直接关系的思想。在这种关系中，文化产品就是一种基本社会政治结构的表象。,"But cultural studies is drawn to the idea of a direct relationship, in which cultural products are the symptom of an underlying socio-political configuration."
8781,比如英国的开放大学（Open University)开设的“通俗文化”这门课，从1982年到1985年共有五千人学习了这门课，其中有一个单元是关于“电视警察系列剧和法律与秩序”的，它从不断变化的社会政治形势的角度分析了警察系列剧的发展。,"For example, the ‘Popular Culture’ course of the Open University in Britain, which was taken by some 5,000 people between 1982 and 1985, contained a unit on ‘Television Police Series and Law and Order’, which analysed the development of police series in terms of a changing socio-political situation."
8782,思想和感情目前会使彼此误入歧途，而六个世纪以前这些情况就不大可能发生。,Thought  and  feeling  are  able  to mislead one another at present in ways which were hardly possible  six  centuries  ago.
8782,倘若这种合二为一的笔法确实再度受人欢迎，我们就需要更纯粹的科学和更纯粹的诗歌的魔力才能把作者与读者的思想感情混合起来。,"We  need  a  spell  of  purer  science  and purer poetry before the two can again be mixed, if indeed this will  ever  become  once  more  desirable."
8782,我在第二版中増加了一个讨论艾略特先生诗歌的附识，以便说明我这虽所谓的纯粹性还有一些补充意见是谈论价值的。在第二版中修改了个别枝节问题。,"In  the  Second  Edition  I added a note on Mr. Eliot’s poetry which will elucidate what I mean  here  by  purity,  and  some  supplementary  remarks  upon Value; in the Third, a few minor improvements have been made."
8783,像Chomskyan/Chomskyite这种交替形式的冗余性——所有这些形式都符合正常的构词规则—— 可以解释词汇中的一些偶然缺位（又称“词汇缺位”）现象 。,"The redundancy of alternative forms such as Chomskyan/Chomskyite, all of which conform to the regular rules of word formation, may explain some of the accidental gaps (also called lexical gaps) in the lexicon."
8783,偶然缺位指合式但并不存在的词。,
8783,,Accidental gaps are well-formed but nonexisting words.
8783,语言中实际存在的词仅仅是可能的词的一个子集而已。,The actual words in a language constitute only a subset of the possible words.
8784,可数名词可以计数且成为复数——one potato（―个土豆），two potatoes（两个土豆）。,"Count nouns can be enumerated and pluralized—one potato, two potatoes."
8784,可数名词前面可以加不定冠词a和量如 many potatoes（许多土豆），但不能加much，不能说*much potato。,"They may be preceded by the indefinite determiner a, and by the quantifier many as in many potatoes, but not by much, *much potato."
8784,可数名词前面必须加上某种类型的限定词。,They must also occur with a determiner of some kind.
8785,我们看到，鼻音在英语的辅音中是个区别特征，但是在英语的元音中，它是非区别特征。,"We have seen that nasality is a distinctive feature of English consonants, but it is a nondistinctive feature for English vowels."
8785,根据音义之间的任意关系，我们没法预知meat—词以双唇鼻塞音m起首，而 beat—词以双唇口塞音b起首。,"Given the arbitrary relationship between form and meaning, there is no way to predict that the word meat begins with a nasal bilabial stop [m] and that the word beat begins with an oral bilabial stop [b]."
8785,你知道这个，是因为你学过这些词。,You learn this when you learn the words.
8785,"另一方面，在 bean，mean,comb和sing这些词的元音中，鼻音这一特征的值是可以预知的，因为它只出现在鼻辅音前。","On the other hand, the nasality feature value of the vowels in bean, mean, comb, and sing is predictable because they occur before nasal consonants."
8785,当某一类音的某个特征值可以通过规则预知的时候，这个特征就是非区别性的，或是冗余的，或者叫作这一类音的一个可预测特征（这三个术语是等价的）。,"When a feature value is predictable by rule for a certain class of sounds, the feature is a nondistinctive or redundant or predictable feature for that class.(The three terms are equivalent.)"
8785,因此，鼻音是英语元音的一个冗余特征，但却是英语辅音的一个非冗余（区别性或是音位性的）特征。,"Thus nasality is a redundant feature in English vowels, but a nonredundant (distinctive or phonemic) feature for English consonants."
8786,例如，考虑英语的过去时规则，回忆一下，它有两条次规则。,"Consider, for example, the English past-tense rule and recall that it has two subrules."
8786,第一条是当一个规则动词以龈塞音（/t/或/d/）结尾时插入一个混元音，例如mated[metəd]。,"The first inserts a schwa when a regular verb ends in an alveolar stop (/t/ or /d/), as in mated [metəd]."
8786,第二条使得过去时词素/d/在出现于清音前时清化，例如raped[ript]或peaked[pʰikt]。,"The second devoices the past-tense morpheme /d/ when it occurs after a voiceless sound, as in reaped [ript] or peaked [pʰikt]."
8787,伍尔夫冈·伊塞尔（见下文第52-54页）争辩说，文学文本总是包含着“空白”，只有读者才能填上。,"Wolfgang Iser (see below, pp. 52–54) argues that literary texts always contain ‘blanks’ which only the reader can fill."
8787,华兹华斯这首诗的两节之间之所以产生“空白”，是因为两节间的关系没有说明。,The ‘blank’ between the two stanzas of Wordsworth’s poem arises because the relationship between the stanzas is unstated.
8787,阐释的行为要求我们填充这一空白。,The act of interpretation requires us to fill this blank.
8788,大部分人叫作“嘴巴”的，我们语言学工作者称为口腔，以区别于鼻腔。鼻腔包括鼻子、连接鼻子和喉咙的通道，加上鼻窦。,"What sensible people call ""the mouth"", linguists call the oral cavity to distinguish it from the nasal cavity, which is the nose and the plumbing that connects it to the throat, plus your sinuses."
8788,"最后还有舌头和嘴唇,它们都能快速运动和改变形状。","Finally there are the tongue and the lips, both of which are capable of rapid movement and shape changing."
8788,以上这些加起来叫声道。,All of these together comprise the vocal tract.
8789,由于同一物种中也具有地域方言，他们与人类语言也很相似。和人类相同，这些方言也是由父母传递给后代。,"They also resemble human languages in that there are ""regional dialects"" within the same species, and as with humans, these dialects are transmitted from parents to offspring."
8789,事实上，研究者们注意到，地域差异在鸣禽中的保存比人类还要好，这是因为它们不会受到广播或电视的影响，而使得地域口音逐渐趋同。,"Indeed, researchers have noted that dialect differences may be better preserved in songbirds than in humans because there is no homogenization of regional accents due to radio or TV."
8790,强力诗人们分别或连续采用六种心理防范形式来对付那种“影响的焦虑”(anxiety of influence)。,Strong poets cope with the ‘anxiety of influence’ by adopting separately or suc- cessively six psychic defences.
8790,这些形式以比喻的形式出现在他们的诗歌中，使他们可以从父辈的诗歌中“转脱”出来。,These appear in their poetry as tropes which allow a poet to ‘swerve’ from a father’s poems.
8790,这六种比喻是：反讽、提喻、换喻、夸张/反语、隐喻、再换喻(metalepsis)。,"The six tropes are irony, synecdoche, metonymy, hyperbole/litotes, metaphor and metalepsis."
8791,十分著名的论调随举几端，便证明我的断言持之有故。它们出自亚里士多德，朗吉努斯，贺拉斯，布瓦格，德莱顿，艾迪生，华兹华斯，何尔律治卡莱尔，马修•阿诺德以及几位年代较晚的作家。,"A few specimens of the most famous utterances of Aristotle, Longinus, Horace, Boileau, Dryden, Addison, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Carlyle, Matthew Arnold and some more modern authors, will justify this assertion."
8791,“所有的人都自然而然地从摹仿中获得快感。”“诗歌主要表述的是一般真理”，“它要求热情与疯狂相济为用；魂不附体时我们就化为想象的产物”。,‘All men naturally receive pleasure from imitation.’ ‘Poetry is chiefly conversant about general truth.’‘It demands an enthusiasm allied to madness; transported out of ourselves we become what we imagine.
8792,迄今为止左右人类历史的一直是劳动的需要；对于弗洛伊德来说，这一严酷的需要意味着我们必须压抑一部分追求快乐和满足的趋向。,What has dominated human history to date is the need tolabour; and for Freud that harsh necessity means that we must repress some of our tendencies to pleasure and gratification.
8792,如果我们不是为了生存而必须工作，我们也许终日倦眠而无所事事。,"If we were not called upon to work in order to survive, we might simply lie around all day doing nothing."
8792,每个人都得经受弗洛伊德所谓的“现实原则”对“快乐原则”的压抑，但是某些人甚至整个社会都可能会由于压抑过度而致病。,"Every human being has to undergo this repression of what Freud named the 'pleasure principle' by the 'reality principle', but for some of us, and arguably for whole societies, the repression may become excessive and make us ill."
8793,“狂欢化”是巴赫金提出的术语，用来说明狂欢节对文学类型形成的影响。,‘Carnivalization’ is the term Bakhtin uses to describe the shaping effect of Carnival on literary genres.
8793,最早的狂欢化的文学形式是苏格拉底式对话体和梅尼普斯式讽刺体。,The earliest carnivalized literary forms are the Socratic dialogue and the Menippean satire.
8793,苏格拉底式对话体从根源上讲接近口头对话的明快与不隔，在这种对话体中，真理是在不同观点的交流中得以展现，而不是在权威作者的个人独白中被发现。,"The former is in its origins close to the immediacy of oral dialogue, in which the discovery of truth is conceived as an unfolding exchange of views rather than as an authoritative monologue."
8794,由于电脑时代的刺激，computer（电脑）、mouse（鼠标）、cookie（网络跟踪器）、cache（高速缓存）、virus（电脑病毒）和bundle（捆绑销售）都是近期语义扩大的例子。,"More recent broadenings, spurred by the computer age, are computer, mouse, cookie, cache, virus, and bundle."
8794,footage以前是指一定长度的电影或是录像，但现在指任意一段电子视频，比如DVD，也不管其长度究竟能不能用英尺（feet）来衡量了。,"Footage use to refer to a certain length of film or videotape, but nowadays it means any excerpt from the electronic video media such as DVDs, irrespective of whether its length can be measured in feet."
8794,这里我们要表达一下与大家不同的意见：我们可以预测，google这个词，虽然现在的意思是“用谷歌搜索引擎搜索”，但以后其意思会扩大到“使用搜索引擎在网上搜索”。,"Google was broadened first from the name of a company to a verb meaning “to use that company’s search engine on the Internet,” and from there further broadened to simply “search the Internet.”"
8795,在18世纪初，半带神秘色彩的象征学说是美学理论的中心。,At the centre of aesthetic theory at the turn of the eighteenth century is the semi-mystical doctrine of the symbol.
8795,对于浪漫主义，象征确实成为解决一切问题的万应灵药。,"For Romanticism, indeed, the symbol becomes the panacea for all problems."
8795,在象征之内，日常生活中无法解决的一系列矛盾冲突——主体与客体，普遍与特殊，感觉与概念，物质与精神，秩序与自发——都可以奇迹般地得到解决。,"Within it, a whole set of conflicts which were felt to be insoluble in ordinary life — between subject and object, the universal and the particular, the sensuous and the conceptual, material and spiritual, order and spontaneity — could be magically resolved."
8796,反映物作为批评原型而得到了长期沿用，这表明它作为美学理论的一个出发点，自有其合适性，并能给人以启迪。,The long survival of the reflector as archetype demonstrates its aptness and suggestiveness as one point of departure for aesthetic theory.
8796,然而类比思维法总免不了分类上的呆板性。,"The endemic disease of analogical thinking, however, is hardening of the categories."
8796,正如柯尔律治所说，“一切比喻都是跛足的”；所谓相似物其实只是同被喻物部分相象，碰巧适时的类比原型尽管突出了关键之点，但某一事物倘若处在其原始分类以外，那么它的种种特性便难以把握而被置于一边了。,"For as said,‘No simile runs on all four legs’; analogues are by their nature only partial parallels, and the very sharpness of focus afforded by a happily chosen archetype makes marginal and elusive those qualities of an object which fall outside its primitive categories."
8797,对脑损伤患者的研究，一直是有关语言和其他认知系统之神经基础的一个主要信息来源。,The investigation of individuals with brain damage has been a major source of information regarding the neural basis of language and other cognitive systems.
8797,有人可能会说，这就像是试图通过观察损坏的汽车发动机来了解它以前是如何工作的。,One might suggest that this is like trying to understand how an automobile engine works by looking at a damaged engine.
8797,这是一个好的类比吗？,Is this a good analogy?
8797,如果是，为什么？,"If so, why?"
8797,如果不是，又为什么？,"If not, why not?"
8797,回答时请谈谈为什么一个损坏的系统能够或不能够提供有关正常系统的信息。,"In your answer, discuss how a damaged system can or cannot provide information about the normal system."
8798,没人知道语言变化的全部原因。,No one knows all the causes of linguistic change.
8798,有些语音变化是同化的结果，同化是一个使发音变得容易的基本生理过程。,"Some sound changes result from assimilation, a fundamentally physiological process of ease of articulation."
8798,其他的语音变化，如“元音大换位”，就更加难以解释。,"Others, like the Great Vowel Shift, are more difficult to explain."
8798,语法方面的一些变化可以解释为类推变化，或规则的泛化，使语言变得更有规则，例如用cows代替kine，用waked代替woke。,"Some grammatical changes are analogic changes, generalizations that lead to more regularity, such as cows instead of kine and waked instead of woke."
8799,许多文学理论入门都会对各种批评“学派”进行一番描述。,Many introductions to literary theory describe a series of ‘schools’ of criticism.
8799,理论被说成是一系列不能用同一标准衡量的“研究方法”，它们各自都有自己的理论地位和批评责任。,"Theory is treated as a series of competing ‘approaches’, each with its theoretical positions and commitments."
8799,但是各种理论介绍所确认的理论流派——结构主义、解构主义、女权主义、心理分析、马克思主义、新历史主义——又有许多相同之处。,"But the theoretical movements that introductions identify – such as structuralism, deconstruction, feminism, psychoanalysis, Marxism, and new historicism – have a lot in common."
8800,艺术家的活动天地既可能是想象丰富的直觉世界，也可能是常识世界或科学世界。同一块天地，这种理论可以认为其中有神祇、巫师，妖怪和柏拉图式的理念，那种理论也可以认为这一切均属子虚乌有。,"It may be maintained that the artists world is that of imaginative intuition, or of common sense, or of natural science; and this world may be held to include, or not to include, gods, witches, chimeras, and Platonic Ideas."
8800,因此，即使有多种理论一致认为规范作品的首要制约力在于它所表现的世界，这其中也可区分出从崇尚最坚定的 现实主义到推崇最飘渺的理想主义这样迥然不同的流派来。,"Consequently, theories which agree in assigning to the represented universe the primary control over a legitimate work of art may vary from recommending the most uncompromising realism to the most remote idealism."
8801,像许多语言一样，俄语名词有一套屈折后缀系统，表示这个名词是主语、宾语、领有者或者是其他语法角色。英语是靠语序来实现这一功能。,"Like many other languages, Russian has a system of inflectional suffixes for nouns that indicates the noun's grammatical relation—whether a subject, object, possessor, and so on— something English does with word order."
8801,例如，在英语中，Maxim defends Victor（马克西姆维护维克多）和Victor defends Maxim （维克多维护马克西姆）这两句话意思有别，关键在于词序不同。,"For example, in English, the sentence Maxim defends Victor means something different from Victor defends Maxim.The order of the words is critical."
8802,流音[l]和[r]，发音时口腔中有某种程度的阻碍，但还不足以形成真正的收紧或摩擦。,"Liquids [l] [r] In the production of the sounds [l] and [r], there is some obstruction of the airstream in the mouth, but not enough to cause any real constriction or friction."
8802,这就是流音。,These sounds are liquids.
8802,前面龈音一节中提到，这两个流音发音方式相当不同，但能放在同一个类中，是因为声学特征相似。,"They are articulated differently, as described in the earlier alveolar section, but are grouped as a class because they are acoustically similar."
8802,也因为如此，外国人讲英语时可能会混淆两者。,"Due to that similarity, foreign speakers of English may confuse the two sounds and substitute one for the other."
8803,确认人脑的哪些部分负责人类的语言能力，一直是一个核心问题。,An issue of central concern has been to determine which parts of the brain are responsible for human linguistic abilities.
8803,19世纪早期，弗朗兹•约瑟夫 •加尔提出了（脑功能 ）定位理论。该理论认为人类的不同认知能力和行为，都由脑的特定部分所控制。,"In the early nineteenth century, Franz Joseph Gall proposed the theory of localization, which is the idea that different human cognitive abilities and behaviors are localized in specific parts of the brain."
8803,从我们现有的脑知识来看，加尔的某些特定的观点还是很滑稽的。,"In light of our current knowledge about the brain, some of Gall’s particular views are amusing."
8803,比如，他提出语言能力位于脑前叶位置，因为年轻时他曾注意到他的同学中口才最好、最聪明的人都双眼外突，他认为这反映了他们的脑物质发育过度。,"For example, he proposed that language is located in the frontal lobes of the brain because as a young man he had noticed that the most articulate and intelligent of his fellow students had protruding eyes, which he believed reflected overdeveloped brain material."
8803,他还提出了一个被称为“器官学”的伪科学理论，也就是后来为世人所知的颅相学，即通过检查头盖骨上的“隆起”来确定个性特点、智力和其他特征的做法。,"He also put forth a pseudoscientific theory called “organology” that later came to be known as phrenology, which is the practice of determining personality traits, intellectual capacities, and other matters by examining the “bumps” on the skull."
8804,但是你越检验沃尔夫的论点，你越觉得没有道理。,"But the more you examine Whorf's arguments, the less sense they make."
8804,就拿那个工人和空筒的事来说。,Take the story about the worker and the ''empty'' drum.
8804,沃尔夫认为灾难的原因是因为empty的意思可以是“没有、虚无“或是“里面的东西光了”。这个工人，他的思考方式受到他语言分类的塑造，没有去分辨“原有的用光了”和 “虚无”，所以一丢，轰！,"The seeds of disaster supposedly lay in the semantics of “empty”, which, Whorf claimed, means both ''without its usual contents'' and ''null and void, empty, inert.'' The hapless worker, his conception of reality molded by his linguistic categories, did not distinguish between the ''drained'' and ''inert'' senses, hence, flick . . . boom!"
8804,但是，等一下，挥发的汽油是看不见的。,But wait.Gasoline vapor is invisible.
8805,与动词一起出现的各种NP是该动词的论元。,The various NPs that occur with a verb are its arguments.
8805,因此，不及物动词有一个论元：主语；及物动词有两个论元：主语和直接宾语；双及物动词有三个论元：主语、直接宾语和间接宾语。,"Thus intransitive verbs have one argument: the subject; transitive verbs have two arguments: the subject and direct object; ditransitive verbs have three arguments: the subject, direct object, and indirect object."
8805,一个动词的论元结构是其意义的一部分，包含在它的词条中。,The argument structure of a verb is part of its meaning and is included in its lexical entry.
8806,马克思主义的原理像基督教的教义一样不容易总结，不过马克思有两个著名论述完全可以作为我们讨论问题的出发点。不是人们的意识决定他们的存在，而是相反，人们的社会存在决定他们的意识。,"The basic tenets of Marxism are no easier to summarize than the essential doctrines of Christianity, but two well-known statements by Marx provide a sufficient point of departure: It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their consciousness."
8806,哲学家们只是对世界做出了不同的解释；而重要的是改变这个世界。,The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it.
8807,"AAE又称作“非裔美国人乡土英语”（African American Vernacular English, AAVE）、“美国黑人英语”（Ebonics）和“黑人英语”（Black English, BE ）。","AAE is also called African American Vernacular English (AAVE), Ebonics, and Black English (BE)."
8807,有一部分美国黑人说这种英语，但绝不是全部。,It is spoken by some (but by no means all) African Americans.
8807,这个问题将在第十章讨论。,It is discussed in chapter 10.
8808,其实，只要聋人聚集在一起生活就会发展出一个完整的语言出来，它跟世界上所有口语语言有一样复杂的文法机制。,"They are found wherever there is a community of deaf people, and each one is a distinct, full language, using the same kinds of grammatical machinery found worldwide in spoken languages."
8808,例如美国手势语言跟英文或是英国手势语言并不相像。但是它主语和动词的一致性和性系统的用法却很像美国的印地安语言的一支纳瓦霍语与非洲的班图语。,"For example, American Sign Language (ASL), used by the deaf community in the United States, does not resemble English, or British Sign Language, but relies on agreement and gender systems in a way that is reminiscent of Navajo and Bantu."
8809,"The child,a police officer等短语都属于一个句法范畴：名词短语(NP),这是英语和世上其他每种语言都有的句法范畴之一。","The child, a police officer, John, and so on belong to the syntactic category noun phrase (NP), one of several syntactic categories in English and every other language in the world."
8809,NP在一个句子中可以充当主语或是宾语。,NPs may function as the subject or as an object in a sen- tence.
8809,NP通常都有一个限定词(例如a或the)和一个名词，但是NP也可能同样包含一个专有名词、代词、没有限定词的名字甚至是小句或句子。,"NPs often contain a determiner (like a or the) and a noun, but they may also consist of a proper name, a pronoun, a noun without a determiner, or even a clause or a sentence."
8810,这种“话到嘴边”现象(通常称为TOT现象)并不少见。,This tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon (often referred to as TOT) is not uncom- mon.
8810,可设想一下，要是你想要的词儿就是想不起来，你该有多烦心。,"But if you could rarely find the word you wanted, imagine how frustrated you would be."
8810,然而这正是许多失语症患者的遭遇，其障碍通常包括严重的命名不能症，也就是没有能力找到想要说的那个词。,This is the fate of many aphasics whose impairment involves severe anomia—the inability to find the word you wish to speak.
8811,另一种实验技术称为“命名任务”，该任务要求受试者大声朗读打印出来的词。,"Another experimental technique, called the naming task, asks the subject to read aloud a printed word."
8811,（“命名任务”的一种变体也被用来研究失语症患者，要求他们说出图片中物体的名称。,"(A variant of the naming task is also used in studies of people with aphasia, who are asked to name the object shown in a picture.)"
8811,）受试者朗读像dough (生面团）和steak (牛排）这样拼写不规则的词， 比朗读像doe(雌鹿）和stake(树粧）这样拼写规则的词稍慢一些，但仍然比朗读duff这样捏造的字母串要快。,"Subjects read irregularly spelled words like dough and steak just slightly more slowly than regularly spelled words like doe and stake, but still faster thaninvented strings like cluff."
8812,可形式主义者们却常常把情节的理论和陌生化概念联系起来：他们的情节阻碍我们把事件看作典型的、熟悉的。,"The Formalists, on the other hand, often linked theory of plot with the notion of defamiliarization: the plot prevents us from regarding the incidents as typical and familiar."
8812,相反，我们常常会不由得感到，绝妙的技巧是如何建构或虚构（制造／伪造）呈现在我们面前的“现实”的。,"Instead, we are made constantly aware how artifice constructs or forges (makes/counterfeits) the ‘reality’ presented to us."
8812,在展示诗人或制造者（poiesis）自身而不是模仿（mimesis）现实这点上，形式主义的情节观正如斯特恩所做的那样，预示了后现代主义的自我反身性。,"In its display of poiesis (‘poet’ = ‘maker’) rather than mimesis (‘copying’ = realism), this looks forward, as does Sterne, to postmodernist self-reflexivity."
8813,这派新历史主义在一定程度上受阿尔都塞、马歇雷、詹姆逊和伊格尔顿著述的影响，按照勒维森的说法，它既是唯物主义的，又是解构主义的。它调遣“历史的想像”以恢复文学作品的当代意义。这当代意义铭刻了作品形成的基质， 但却不清醒地存在于写成的作品“之内”。,"Influenced in part by the work of Althusser, Macherey, Jameson and Eagleton, this New Historicism – according to Levinson, ‘at once materialist and deconstructive’ – deploys the ‘historical imagination’ to restore to a literary work those contemporary meanings which inscribe the matrix in which it is shaped, but which are not consciously ‘in’ the work as written."
8814,什克洛夫斯基称他最引人注目的概念之一为“陌生化”(ostranenie）。,Shklovsky called one of his most attractive concepts ‘defamiliarization’ (ostranenie: ‘making strange’).
8814,他争论说，我们永远也无法保持对事物的新鲜感，那种“常规的”存在要求事物必然在很大的程度上变成“自动的”（他后来使用的概念）。,He argued that we can never retain the freshness of our perceptions of objects; the demands of ‘normal’ existence require that they must become to a great extent ‘automatized’ (a later term).
8814,华兹华斯曾有过天真的幻觉，大自然保持着梦的荣耀和新鲜，然而这种华兹华斯式的幻觉并非人类意识的常态。,
8814,,That Wordsworthian innocent vision through which Nature retains ‘the glory and the freshness of a dream’ is not the normal state of human consciousness.
8815,有的文本比另一些文本更象“孤儿”，因为不稳定的阅读程式尚不足以给它找个继父。,Some texts are more 'orphaned' than others because the conventions of reading are not so ﬁrm as to provide a stepfather.
8815,例如，阅读一篇政治演说必须具备一定的目的论，把文本看成是某人按照话语程式和有关制度惯例，为了达到某种交流的目的组织而成的。,"To read a political speech, for example, is to submit to a teleology, to take the text as governed by a communicative end which one reconstructs with the help of the conventions of discourse and of the relevant institutions."
8815,然而，文学却使文本本身突出，使上述“基本的变迁”和语言独立的产生意义的能力更加自由地发挥作用。,"But literature, foregrounding the text itself, gives freer play to the 'essential drift' and autonomous productivity of the language."
8816,大脑由左右两个大脑半球组成，两个半球之间又胼体相连。胼胝体由200万条纤维相互连接而成，能使大脑的左、右两半球相互交流。,"The brain is composed of cerebral hemispheres, one on the right and one on the left, joined by the corpus callosum, a network of more than 200 million fibers.The corpus callosum allows the two hemispheres of the brain to communicate with each other."
8816,假如没有这种连接系统，大脑的左右两半球就会各自为政。,"Without this system of connections, the two hemispheres would operate independently."
8817,"记得我们前面提到一个脑伤的病人，他对or和be这样的功能词有困难,但是对oar和bee这样的内容词却没有困难。","Recall, too, that patients with damage to the language areas of the brain have more trouble with function words like ""or"" and ""be"" than with content words like ""oar"" and ""bee""."
8817,当每个字都要算钱，例如在打电报或拟报纸的标题时，写的人会把功能词省略掉，希望读的人会依内容词的字序自己把功能词填补上去。,"When words are expensive, as in telegrams and headlines, writers tend to leave the function words out, hoping that the reader can reconstruct them from the order of the content words."
8817,但是因为功能词是一个句子短语结构最可靠的线索，所以电报式的语言常常在语意上是不明确的。,"But because function words are the most reliable clues to the phrase structure of the sentence, telegraphic language is always a gamble."
8818,贯穿于本章论述的“经验”一词是在宽泛意义上运用的，表示精神上出现的任何反应。,Throughout this discussion ‘experience’ will be used in a wide sense to stand for any occurrence in the mind.
8818,它相当于“精神状态或心理过程”经验这个术语常常不恰当地提示了被动性和意识。不过此处所指的许多“经验”敢就会叫作“行动”而且所带有的某些部分不是有意识的也不是内省所能企及的，不像有意识的部分那么重要。,"It is equivalent to ‘mental state, or process’.The term has often unfortunate suggestions of passiveness and of consciousness, but many of the ‘experiences’ here referred to would ordinarily be called ‘actions’ and have parts which are not conscious and not accessible to introspection as important as those which are."
8819,形态规则也许或多或少都具有能产性。英语中将-er加于动词后构成名词，表示“动作者”（一次或习惯性动作），这是一条非常能产的形态规则。大部分英语动词都接受这个后缀，例如：examiner (主考者），exam-taker (参加考试者），analyzer (分析者），lover (爱好者），hunter (猎人）， predictor (预言者）等（尽管拼写不同，-or和-er发音相同，是相同的语素）。,"The rule that adds an -er to verbs in English to produce a noun meaning “one who does” is a nearly productive morphological rule, giving us examiner, examtaker, analyzer, lover, hunter, and so forth, but fAn introduction to languages full productivity owing to “unwords” like *chairer, which is not “one who chairs.”"
8819,,Other derivational morphemes fall farther short of productivity.
8820,文化研究就是探讨我们在多大程度上受文化形式的操纵，以及我们能在多大程度上，或者用哪些方式使文化为其他目的服务，就像人们说的，发挥“能动作用”。,"Cultural studies ask how far we are manipulated by cultural forms and how far or in what ways we are able to use them for other purposes, exercising‘agency’, as it is called."
8820,（“能动作用”是当前理论的简略提法。该问题是关乎我们在多大程度上可以成为对自己行为负责的主体，以及我们貌似自主的选择在多大程度上受制于我们所不能控制的力量的问题。）,"(The question of ‘agency’, to use the shorthand of current theory, is the question of how far we can be subjects responsible for our actions and how far our apparent choices are constrained by forces we do not control.)"
8821,费什相信，他对句子的详细解读仅仅是按照有知识的读者很自然的做法进行的。,Fish believes that his readings of sentences simply follow the natural practice of informed readers.
8821,按照他的观点，读者具有“语言能力”，能够内化阅读需要的句法知识和语义知识。,"In his view a reader is someone who possesses a ‘linguistic competence’, has internalized the syntactic and semantic knowledge required for reading."
8821,文学文本的“有知识的读者”还具备特别的“文学能力”(即常规文学知识)。,The ‘informed reader’ of literary texts has also acquired a specifically ‘literary competence’ (knowledge of literary conventions).
8822,这种因说话者的社会境况不同而产生的语言差异被称为社会语言变项。,Linguistic differences of this sort that vary with the social situation of the speaker are termed sociolinguistic variables.
8822,例如，使用诸如双重否定这样的非标准形式常常与种族自尊心联系在一起，而后者则是社会语境的一部分。,"For example, the use of nonstandard forms like double negation is often associated with pride of ethnicity, which is part of the social context."
8822,许多说奇卡诺英语的人（和说AAE的人）都能说两种方言；他们会根据社会情况使用奇卡诺英语（或AAE）或者SAE。,"Many Chicano speakers (and speakers of AAE) are bidialectal; they can use either ChE (or AAE) or SAE, depending on the social situation."
8823,文学改变和强化普通语言，系统地偏离日常言语。,"Literature transforms and intensifies ordinary language, deviates systematically from everyday speech."
8823,如果在一个公共汽车站上，你走到我身边，嘴里低吟着“Thou still unravished bride of quietness”（你这尚未被夺走童贞的安静的新娘），那么我立刻就会意识到：文学在我面前。,"If you approach me at a bus stop and murmur 'Thou still unravished bride of quietness,' then I am instantly aware that I am in the presence of the literary."
8823,我知道这一点是因为，你的话的肌质(texture)、韵律和音响大大多于从这句话中可以抽取的意义——或者，按照语言学家更为技术性的说法，这句话的能指(signifier)与所指(signified)之间的比例不当。,"I know this because the texture, rhythm and resonance of your words are in excess of their abstractable meaning — or, as the linguists might more technically put it, there is a disproportion between the signifiers and the signifieds."
8824,文学理论一直非常关心修辞学，理论家也就修辞手段的性质和功能争论不休。,"Literary theory has been much concerned with rhetoric, and theorists debate the nature and function of rhetorical figures."
8824,通常，修辞手段的定义是变换或改动“普通的”用法。举个例子说，“我的爱像一朵红红的玫瑰”，这里用玫瑰不是指花，而是指一种极美丽、极宝贵的东西（这就是比喻手法）。,"A rhetorical figure has generally been defined as an alteration of or swerve from ‘ordinary’ usage; for instance, ‘My love is a rose’ uses rose to mean not the flower but something beautiful and precious (this is the figure of metaphor)."
8824,或者“秘密坐在其中”，这里使秘密成为一种能动作用，它能坐在其中（这是拟人法）。,Or ‘The Secret Sits’ makes the secret an agent capable of sitting (personification).
8825,通常，修辞手段的定义是变换或改动“普通的”用法。举个例子说，“我的爱像一朵红红的玫瑰”， 这里用玫瑰不是指花，而是指一种极美丽、极宝贵的东西 (这就是比喻手法或者“秘密坐在其中”，这里使秘密成为一种能动作用，它能坐在其中（这是拟人法)。,"A rhetorical figure has generally been defined as an alteration of or swerve from ‘ordinary’ usage; for instance, ‘My love is a rose’ uses rose to mean not the flower but something beautiful and precious (this is the figure of metaphor).Or ‘The Secret Sits’ makes the secret an agent capable of sitting (personification)."
8825,"修辞学家曾经试图把专门的“比喻用语""和涵盖而更广的、间接的“修辞”手段区别开，前者“放弃”或者改变一个字的意义(如用在比喻当中），而后者以字词的排列达到特定的效果。",Rhetoricians formerly attempted to distinguish specific ‘tropes’ which ‘turn’ or alter the meaning of a word (as in metaphor) from more miscellaneous ‘figures’ of indirection which arrange words to achieve special effects.
8826,有时候无知也可以挺有创意。,"Misconception can sometimes be creative, and nothing in this world both misconceives and creates like a child, as we shall see in chapter 8."
8826,一个新词可以因为不正确的词汇形态分析而进入语言。,A new word may enter the language because of an incorrect morphological analysis.
8826,举例来说，由于错误地认为-er是施事后缀 ，就从peddler（小贩）派生出peddle（兜售）一词。,"For example, peddle was derived from peddler on the mistaken assumption that the -er was the agentive suffix."
8826,这样的词称为逆构词。,Such words are called back-formations.
8826,动词hawk（叫卖），stoke（给炉子添燃料），swindle（诈骗），edit（编辑）都是作为hawker（叫卖的小贩），stoker（司炉），swindler（骗子），editor（编辑）的逆构词而进入英语的。,"The verbs hawk, stoke, swindle, and edit all came into the language as back-formations—of hawker, stoker, swindler, and editor."
8826,英语中pea（豌豆）一词由单数的pease（豌豆）派生而来，因为一些说英语的人以为pease（豌豆）是复数形式。,"Pea was derived from a singular word, pease, by speakers who thought pease was a plural."
8827,一些语素，比如boy(男孩），desire(欲望），gentle(温柔的）和man(男子），本身就构成词，它们是自由语素。,"Some morphemes like boy, desire, gentle, and man may constitute words by themselves.These are free morphemes."
8827,"其他的语素，如-ish,-able,-ness,-ly,dis-,trans-,un-,则永远不能靠自己构成词，但总是词的组成部分，它们是词缀，称为黏着语素。","Other morphemes like -ish, -ness, -ly, pre-, trans-, and un- are never words by themselves but are always parts of words.These affixes are bound morphemes."
8827,我们知道每个词缀出现在其他语素的前面还是后面。,We know whether each affix precedes or follows other morphemes.
8827,un-，pre-(predetermine“预先决定”，prejudge“预先判断”)，bi-(bipolar“双极的”，bisexual“两性的”）是前缀，它们出现在其他语素的前面。,"Thus, un-, pre- (premeditate, prejudge), and bi- (bipolar, bisexual) are prefixes.They occur before other morphemes."
8827,另一些语素只能作为后缀出现在其他语素的后面。,"Some morphemes occur only as suffixes, following other morphemes."
8828,里奇（1980）把女性结合描述为一种反抗父权制权力的行动，还提出了“女同性恋连续统一体”（Lesbian continuum）的概念。“通过每个女人的生平和整个历史描述一个广大的连续范围内女人认同的经验”。,"Rich (1980) depicts woman-bonding as an act of resistance to patriarchal power, and advances the concept of ‘lesbian continuum’ to describe ‘a range – through each woman’s life and throughout history – of woman-identified experience’."
8828,她的这一概念不仅是性经验，而且是包括家庭关系、朋友关系、政治关系等在内的具有“基本强度的”所有形式的女性经验。,"Her definition encompasses not simply sexual experience but all forms of ‘primary intensity’ between and among women, including relationships of family, friendship and politics."
8829,在其他一些女性写作中，女性分析肯定的不是“文本性的性，而是性的文本性”（玛丽·雅可布斯[Mary Jacobus]语）。,"As with other versions of l’ecriture féminine, gynesis asserts, in Mary Jacobus’s phrase, ‘not the sexuality of the text but the textuality of sex’."
8829,如此看来，女性分析是这样一种写作，它不特别强调性别特征，而要打乱固定的意义，鼓励超越作者和批评家控制的文本自由嬉戏。,"This, then, is a kind of writing which is not specifically gendered but disrupts fixed meaning and encourages textual free play beyond authorial or critical control."
8829,贾尔丹这一与女性批评理论对立的概念对女性批评自以为有意义的核心观念提出了严肃的疑问。,Jardine’s opposition to gynocentric feminist theory forms an important questioning of the core concepts which gynocentrism takes to be self-evidently meaningful.
8830,伍尔夫关于女作家的最有趣的文章之一是《 女人的职业》，在这篇文章中，她说自己的写作 生涯 受到两方面的阻碍。,"One of Woolf’s most interesting essays about women writers is ‘Professions for Women’, in which she regards her own career as hindered in two ways."
8830,一是她被主流的女人意识形态所囚禁和束缚。,"First, she was imprisoned and constrained by the dominant ideologies of womanhood."
8830,二是表达女性激情的禁忌妨碍她“表达自己身体体验的真实 ”。,"Second, the taboo about expressing female passion prevented her from ‘telling the truth about [her] own experiences as a body.’"
8831,我们不能排除世界语言同源的可能性，这种观点认为所有语言都来自一个“源语”，有人称之为诺斯特拉提克语。如果不是人为隐藏起来了的话，它就是被埋在了历史的深处。,"We cannot eliminate the possibility that the entire world’s languages spring ultimately from a single source, an “ur- language” that some have termed Nostratic, which is buried, if not concealed, in the depths of the past."
8831,对这个饶有兴味的题目感兴趣的读者，可能会想读一下加利福尼亚大学伯克利分校的乔安娜•尼科尔斯教授的著作。,Readers interested in this fascinating topic may wish to read the writings of Professor Johanna Nichols of the University of California at Berkeley.
8832,像Chomskyan/Chomskyite这种交替形式的冗余性——所有这些形式都符合正常的构词规则——可以解释词汇中的一些偶然缺位（又称“词汇缺位”）现象 。,"The redundancy of alternative forms such as Chomskyan/Chomskyite, all of which conform to the regular rules of word formation, may explain some of the accidental gaps (also called lexical gaps) in the lexicon."
8832,偶然缺位指合式但并不存在的词。,
8832,,Accidental gaps are well-formed but nonexisting words.
8832,语言中实际存在的词仅仅是可能的词的一个子集而已。,The actual words in a language constitute only a subset of the possible words.
8833,以这种方式运用规则叫作派生。,The application of rules in this way is called a derivation.
8833,我们已举过好多派生的例子，有复数形式是如何推导出来的，有口元音音位如何变为鼻音的，还有[t]和[d]如何在某种环境下变为闪音的。,"We have given examples of derivations that show how plurals are derived, how phonemically oral vowels become nasalized, and how /t / and /d/ become flaps in certain environments."
8833,因而派生以一种明晰的方式既显示出一个语法音系规则的作用，又显示出一个语法中音系规则的作用结果。,A derivation is thus an explicit way of showing both the effects and the function of phonological rules in a grammar.
8834,最后，派生词缀似乎可以分为两类。,"Finally, derivational affixes appear to come in two classes."
8834,其中一类增加后缀会引发发音上的细微变化。,"In one class, the addition of a suffix triggers subtle changes in pronunciation."
8834,举例来说，把词缀-ity附加到specific (发音是specifik:，最后的字母c发k音)上，得到一个新词specificity (发音是specifisity，最后的字母c发s音)。,"For example, when we affix -ity to specific (pronounced “specifik” with a k sound), we get specificity (pronounced “specifisity” with an s sound)."
8835,然而，我们已经注意到，可以把句13理解为句14或者句15，但不能理解为句16或句17。,"However, we have noted that 13 can have the interpretation of 14 or 15, but not of 16 or"
8835,这样，我们看到，在给定的句18的派生句中，只有在句14或者句15—而不是句16或者句17—是句18的底层结构的条件下，才能把T3应用于句18。,"17. Thus we can see that T3 can apply to 18 only if either 14 or 15, but not 16 or 17, was the structure underlying 18 in the given derivations of"
8835,然而，象我们刚刚看到的那样，这个并不存在于句18本身。,"18. However, this information is not represented in 18 itself, as we have just observed."
8835,因此，要将T3用于句18，我们必须对句18的派生句有所了解，也就是说，我们必须掌握句18有标记的括注中所没有包含的信息。,"Therefore, to apply T3 to 18 we must know something about the history of derivation of 18 – we must have information that would not be contained in the labeled bracketing of 18 itself."
8836,如果我们发明一个形容词pouzy来描写静电对头发产生的效应，你马上就能理解下面这两个句子：“在地毯上走确实pouzified我的头发”，“pouzification的最佳方法就是用气球在你的头上摩擦”。,"If we invent an adjective, pouzy, to describe the effect of static electricity on hair, you will immediately understand the sentences “Walking on that carpet really pouzified my hair” and “The best method of pouzification is to rub a balloon on your head.”"
8836,这意味着在我们的心理词典中一定有一张派生语素的清单，以及决定它们如何附加到词根或词干上的规则。,This means that we must have a list of the derivational morphemes in our mental dictionaries as well as the rules that determine how they are added to a root or stem.
8836,通过附加派生语素而得到的形式被称为派生词。,The form that results from the addition of a derivational morpheme is called a derived word.
8837,纵观美学理论的发展过程，人们在探讨事物真谛时那种种咬文嚼字的把戏确实已经暴露无遗。,It is true that the course of aesthetic theory displays its full measure of the rhetoric and logomachy which seem an inseparable part olE man's discourse about all things that really matter.
8837,但我们对于艺术哲学的多样性和表面上的混乱现象所表示的许多不满，正是因为我们苛求批评去做其力所不能及的事，而对于批评的许多真正的功能却视而不见。,"But a good deal of our impatience with the diversity and seeming chaos in philosophies of art is rooted in a demand from criticism for something it cannot do, at the cost of overlooking many of its genuine powers."
8837,批评不是一门自然科学，甚至连心理科学也算不上，这是我们在今天仍然必须正视的现实结论。,"We still need to face up to the full consequences of the realization that criticism is not a physical, not even a psychological, science."
8838,许多文学理论入门都会对各种批评“学派”进行一番描述。,Many introductions to literary theory describe a series of ‘schools’ of criticism.
8838,理论被说成是一系列不能用同一标准衡量的“研究方法”，它们各自都有自己的理论地位和批评责任。,"Theory is treated as a series of competing ‘approaches’, each with its theoretical positions and commitments."
8838,但是各种理论介绍所确认的理论流派——结构主义、解构主义、女权主义、心理分析、马克思主义、新历史主义——又有许多相同之处。,"But the theoretical movements that introductions identify – such as structuralism, deconstruction, feminism, psychoanalysis, Marxism, and new historicism – have a lot in common."
8839,典型的通用语是一种以大量母语者为基础的语言，母语属于同一语系的人们都有可能学习或使用这种通用语。,"A lingua franca is typically a language with a broad base of native speakers, likely to be used and learned by persons with different native languages (usually in the same language family)."
8839,然而，历史上常常会出现这样的情形，来自世界某地的传教士和商人到了另一遥远的地区，并且试图与那里的居民进行交谈。在这种情况下，由于双方的接触面非常狭窄，文化也过于悬殊，所以一种语言无法有效地发挥通用语的作用。取而代之的是双方（也可能是多方）以他们的本族语为基础创造出一种词项不多、语法规则不那么复杂的初级通用语。,"Often in history, however, speakers of mutually unintelligible languages have been brought into contact under specific socioeconomic and political conditions and have developed a language to communicate with one another that is not native to anyone."
8839,一般来说，许多词项都选自主导语言，该主导语言被称为上层语，另外一种或几种语言则对词库和语法的贡献较少。,
8839,以这种方式混杂在一起形成的语言被称作“皮钦语”。,Such a language is called a pidgin.
8840,我们可不可以再把镜头靠近一点，看一下大脑在处理语言时的运作情形呢？,"Can we zoom in still closer, and locate smaller areas of brain that carry out more circumscribed language tasks?"
8840,这个答案是既“不可以”，也“可以”。,The answer is no and yes.
8840,说“不可以”，是因为大脑中没有更小的一块地区可以赋予语言模型以标签的——至少到现在为止是不能。,"No, there are no smaller patches of brain that one can draw a line around and label as some linguistic module —— at least, not today."
8840,但是说“可以”，是因为皮质一定有某一部分专门负责某一种语言任务，因为大脑受伤会导致某些非常特定的语言行为缺失。,"But yes, there must be portions of cortex that carry out circumscribed tasks, because brain damage can lead to language deficits that are startlingly specific."
8840,这实在是一个非常诱人的两难问题。,It is an intriguing paradox.
8841,病人的脑损部位是在大脑左半球的后部，现称为“韦尼克区”。,
8841,这也就是说，语言的定位偏侧于大脑左半球。,"Language, then, is lateralized to the left hemisphere, and the left hemisphere appears to be the language hemisphere from infancy on."
8841,偏侧化是一个术语，用来指被主要定位到脑某一侧的任何一种认知功能。,Lateralization is the term used to refer to the localization of function to one hemisphere of the brain.
8841,,Figure 2.3 is a view of the left side of the brain that shows Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas.
8842,如果出现这种情况，自我与外部世界的联系就断裂了，潜意识开始建立一个替代的、妄想的现实。,"If this happens, the link between the ego and the external world is ruptured, and the unconscious begins to build up an alternative, delusional reality."
8842,换句话说，精神病患者在关键的地方与现实失去了联系，例如偏执狂和精神分裂症患者那样。神经官能症患者可能出现手臂瘫痪，而精神病患者则可能认为他的手臂已经变成一条象鼻子。,"The psychotic, in other words, has lost contact with reality at key points, as in paranoia and schizophrenia: if the neurotic may develop a paralysed arm, the psychotic may believe that his arm has turned into an elephant's trunk."
8843,大脑由左右两个大脑半球组成，两个半球之间又通过胼胝体相连（见图2.1）。胼胝体由200万 条纤维相互连接而成，能使大脑的左、右两半球相互交流。,"The brain is composed of cerebral hemispheres, one on the right and one on the left, joined by the corpus callosum, a network of more than 200 million fibers (see Figure 2.1).The corpus callosum allows the two hemispheres of the brain to communicate with each other."
8843,假如没有这种连接系统，大脑的左右两半球就会各自为政。,"Without this system of connections, the two hemispheres would operate independently."
8844,片假名用于书写外来词，同时还有与欧洲文字系统中的斜体字相类似的作用。,"One syllabary, katakana, is used for loan words and for special effects similar to italics in European writing."
8844,书写本族词则用平假名。,"The other syllabary, hiragana, is used for native words."
8844,在同一个词中，平假名语符也可以用表意语符来表示，这些语符称为日语汉字，是从汉语借来的。,"Hiragana characters may occur in the same word as ideographic characters, which are called kanji, and are borrowed Chinese characters."
8844,因此，日语的文字系统一部分是词语文字，一部分是音节文字。,"Thus Japanese writing is part word writing, part syllable writing."
8845,片假名用于书写外来词，同时还有与欧洲文字系统中的斜体字相类似的作用。,"One syllabary, katakana, is used for loan words and for special effects similar to italics in European writing."
8845,书写本族词则用平假名。,"The other syllabary, hiragana, is used for native words."
8845,在同一个词中，平假名语符也可以用表意语符来表示，这些语符称为日语汉字，是从汉语借来的。,"Hiragana characters may occur in the same word as ideographic characters, which are called kanji, and are borrowed Chinese characters."
8846,这种对于合成的理想自然的主张比较复杂，交待这一说法的人都引证了一个老掉牙的故事，他们这种一致的做法使人们对引经据典这个研究工作的必要条件的态度由冷漠变为厌烦。故事说的是画家雷西斯。,"Proponents of this somewhat more complex doctrine of the composite ideal refer, with a unanimity which makes indifference to boredom the sine qua non of research, to the old story of the painter Zeuxis who (in Pliny's version), when he desired to represent Juno?"
8846,据普利尼的说法，有一次他想表现米诺的形象，“让人将当地的年轻女子都脱光衣服逐一审视，然后从中选出五个，以便将女人形体中的美妙之处，在他的画像中表现出来”,",‘had the young maidens of the place stripped for examination, and selected five of them, in order to adapt in his picture the most commendable points ia the form of each."
8847,词汇提取的许多特征可以通过词汇判定实验来检验。,Many properties of lexical access can be examined using lexical decision experiments.
8847,在以下例子中，当前呈现的词和刚刚呈现过的词之间的关系被控制起来。,"In the following example, the relationship between the current word and the immediately preceding word is manipulated."
8847,例如，当受试者判定doctor (医生）一词时，倘若刚刚判定的词是 nurse (护士），而不是与doctor语义上毫无关系的词，如flower (花朵），那么前者判定的速度就更快。,"For example, making a lexical decision on the word doctor will be faster if you just made a lexical decision on nurse than if you just made one on a semantically unrelated word such as flower."
8847,这种效应称为“语义启动”：我们说mirse—词启动doctor—词。,This effect is known as semantic priming: we say that the word nurse primes the word doctor.
8847,这种效应的成因也许在于语义相关的词处于心理词库的同一区域，因此，当我们听到一个启动词并在心理词库中查寻它时，它附近语义上与之相关的词会被“唤醒”，更容易在短时间内提取.,"This effect might arise because semantically related words are located in the same part of the mental lexicon, so when we hear a priming word and look it up in the lexicon, semantically related, nearby words are “awakened” and more readily accessible for a few moments."
8848,前腔音[p] [b] [m] [f] [v] [e] [6] [t] [d] [n] [s] [z]。前腔音调音部位在口腔前部，即齿龈隆骨往前。,"Anteriors [p] [b] [m] [f] [v] [θ] [ð] [t] [d] [n] [s] [z] Anterior sounds are consonants produced in the front part of the mouth, that is, from the alveolar area forward."
8848,包括唇音、齿沿音、龈音。,"They include the labials, the interdentals, and the alveolars."
8849,语素是一切语言中最小的语言符号。,
8849,很多语言都有前缀和后缀，但是，以怎样的方式来组配语素，可能各有方式不同。,"Many languages have prefixes and suffixes, but languages may differ in how they deploy these morphemes."
8849,在一种语言当中某个语素是前缀，但是在另一种语言中可能就是后缀，反之亦然。,A morpheme that is a prefix in one language may be a suffix in another and vice versa.
8850,从这些方面着眼来阅读《儿子与情人》的时候，我们就是在为作品构造一个所谓的“潜本文”(sub-text)——一个活动于作品内部的本文，它在暧昧、回避或者过度强调这样一个“症候”点上暴露出来。作为读者的我们能够“写出”这个潜本文，尽管小说本身没有把它写出来。,"In reading Sons and Lovers with an eye to these aspects of the novel, we are constructing what may be called a 'sub-text' for the work —a text which runs within it, visible at certain 'symptomatic' points of ambiguity, evasion or overemphasis, and which we as readers are able to 'write' even if the novel itself does not."
8850,一切文学作品都包含一个或几个这样的潜本文。在某种意义上，可以把这种潜本文称为作品本身的“潜意识”。,"All literary works contain one or more such sub-texts, and there is a sense in which they may be spoken of as the 'unconscious' of the work itself."
8851,从俄狄浦斯过程中脱颖而出的人的主体是一个分裂的主体，它在意识和潜意识之间受到危险的撕扯；潜意识总是可以转回来折磨这个主体。,"The human subject who emerges from the Oedipal process is a split subject, torn precariously between conscious and unconscious; and the unconscious can always return to plague it."
8851,在日常英语中，常用“下意识”一词，而不用“潜意识”，但这是低估潜意识的根本异己性，把它设想为一个在表面下方，离表面很近的地方。,"In popular English speech, the word 'subconscious' rather than 'unconscious' is often used; but this is to underestimate the radical otherness of the unconscious, imagining it as a place just within reach below the surface."
8851,它低估了潜意识的极端古怪和不可思议性，潜意识是一个地方又不是一个地方，它对现实完全无动于衷，它不承认逻辑或否定或因果或矛盾，它事实上完全沉缅于欲动的本能表现以及快乐的追求之中。,"It underestimates the extreme strangeness of the unconscious, which is a place and a non-place, which is completely indifferent to reality, which knows no logic or negation or causality or contradiction, wholly given over as it is to the instinctual play of the drives and the search for pleasure."
8852,在我看来，研究这些课题的结构主义方法和行为主义方法的基本弱点在于：忠实于肤浅的解释，相信人的心理必定比任何一个已知的生理器官都简单，以及相信最简单的假设必定足以解释所有能观察到的现象。,"It seems to me that the essential weakness in the structuralist and behaviorist approaches to these topics is the faith in the shallowness of explanations, the belief that the mind must be simpler in its structure than any known physical organ and that the most primitive of assumptions must be adequate to explain whatever phenomena can be observed."
8852,"于是，人们不加论证（或用定义为真的方式)就想当然地以为，语言是一种“习惯结构”或联想的连接网络；或者语言知识只不过是“知道怎祥""的事情，一种可用反应倾向系统来表示的技巧。","Thus, it is taken for granted without argument or evidence (or is presented as true by definition) that a language is a “habit structure” or a network of associative connections, or that knowledge of language is merely a matter of “knowing how,” a skill expressible as a system of dispositions to respond."
8852,据此，语言知识必须通过重复和训练缓慢地发展，其明显的复杂性來自于非常简单的要素的剧增，而不是来自于心理组织的更深层的原理，这种原理就像消化或协调运动的机制那样，是内省方法所无法了解到的。,"Accordingly, knowledge of language must develop slowly through repetition and training, its apparent complexity resulting from the proliferation of very simple elements rather than from deeper principles of mental organization that may be as inaccessible to introspection as the mechanisms of digestion or coordinated movement."
8853,一个比喻可能是说明性或者图解性的，它提供了一个具体实例来表明某种关系，不然的话就得用抽象字眼来表述这种关系。,"A metaphor may be illustrative or diagrammatical, providing a concrete instance of a relation which would otherwise have to be stated in abstract terms."
8853,这是最为普通的择字或散文中比喻的用法。,This is the most common scientific or prose use of metaphor.
8853,这种用法在情感语言和诗歌中是罕见的；雪莱的诗句“五彩玻璃的穹顶”几乎是脑海里闪现出来的唯一的例证。,It is rare in emotive language and in poetry; Shelley’s ‘Dome of many-coloured glass’ is almost the only example which springs to mind.
8854,"短语的高层结构包括助词(INFL) , 它标明时式、情态、时态和否定。","The higher levels of phrase structure include auxiliaries (INFL),  which signifies tense, modality, aspect, and negation."
8854,名词用格来标示，用动词或其他述语在心理词汇中的特征来指定角色的意义。,Nouns are marked for case and assigned seman­tic roles by the mental dictionary entry of the verb or other predicate.
8854,短语可以从深层结构中移出，留下一个空隙或语迹，使它可以形成问句、相关子句、被动句及其他的架构。,"Phrases can be moved from their deep-structure positions, leaving a gap or ""trace,"" by a structure-dependent movement rule, thereby forming questions, relative clauses, passives, and other widespread constructions."
8855,然而，这种理论的一个显著的问题就是，说话者知道很多在现实世界中没有所指的词（比如“霍比特人、独角兽、哈利•波特”）。,"An obvious problem for such a theory, however, is that speakers know many words that have no real-world referents (e.g., hobbits, unicorns, and Harry Potter)."
8855,可是，说话者确实知道这些词语表达的意义。,Yet speakers do know the meanings of these expressions.
8855,与此类似，像of（…… 的）和 by （由、被）这样的功能词以及像 will （将）和may（可能）这样的情态动词，指的是现实世界中的什么实体？,"Similarly, what real-world entities would function words like “of” and “by”, or “modal verbs” such as “will” or “may” refer to?"
8856,英语已不再是高度屈折化的语言，但它确实还有另外一些屈折变化词尾，例如复数后缀，通常加在某些单数名词上，如boy/boys，cat/cats等等。古英语及中古英丰富的曲折变化详见第十一章。,"English also has other inflectional endings such as the plural suffix, which is attached to certain singular nouns, as in boy/boys and cat/cats."
8856,在英语目前所处的历史阶段，一共有8种黏着屈折词缀。,"In contrast to Old and Middle English, which were more richly inflected languages, as we discuss in chapter 11, modern English has only eight bound inflectional affixes."
8857,与世界上许多其他语言相比，英语的屈折形态相对较少。,"Compared to many languages of the world, English has relatively little inflectional morphology."
8857,有些语言屈折程度非常高。,Some languages are highly inflected.
8857,东非地区广泛使用的斯瓦希里语的动词可以与多种语素一起构成屈折变化，比如说nimepiga这个词（由ni + me + pig + a 构 成）意思是“他打[撞到]了什么东西”。,"In Swahili, which is widely spoken in eastern Africa, verbs can be inflected with multiple morphemes, as in nimepiga (ni + me + pig + a), meaning “he has hit something.”"
8858,从生物学视角来看，组织水平问题有其独特性，仍然是一个基本问题，正如1974年会议所提出的那样。,"The question of the level of organization at which unique properties emerge remains a basic question from a biological point of view, as it was at the 1974 conference."
8858,Gallistel的观察结果使我们想到“渠化”。这个概念是60年前沃丁顿引入进化与发展生物学领域的，指“在反应过程中，无论条件发生多小的变化都要调整以获取一个确定结果”的过程。这样才能确保“产生正常结果，即面对无法避免的存在危机时的最佳物种”。,"Gallistel’s observations recall the concept of “canalization” introduced into evolutionary and developmental biology by C. H. Waddington sixty years ago, referring to processes “adjusted so as to bring about one definite end result regardless of minor variations in conditions during the course of the reaction,” thus ensuring “the production of the normal, that is optimal type in the face of the unavoidable hazards of existence.”"
8859,这个毛病看起来好像跟染色体第11对上的基因有关，这个基因的缺损会造成钙质摄取的不平衡，影响到发展期的大脑、脑壳和内脏。,"The syndrome seems to be associated with a defective gene on chromosome 11 involved in the regulation of calcium, and it acts in complex ways on the brain, skull, and internal organs during development, though no one knows why it has the effects it does."
8859,这些孩子的外表看起来彼此非常相像，但与父母都不像。他们都很矮、很瘦、脸很窄、额头很宽、鼻梁很扁、下巴缩进去、虹膜有星状图样、嘴唇很厚。,"The children have an unusual appearance: they are short and slight, with narrow faces and broad foreheads,  at nasal bridges, sharp chins, star-shaped patterns in their irises, and full lips."
8860,"对非洲的一些民族来说，一个新生儿只是一个kintu, 即一个“东西”， 还不能算是一个muntu，即一个“人”。","To some people of Africa, a newborn child is a kintu, a “thing,”not yet a muntu, a“person.”"
8860,只有通过语言的学习，孩子才能成为一个人。,Only by the act of learning language does the child become a human being.
8860,从这一传统来说，我们之所以都能成为“人”，是因为我们至少都掌握了一种语言。,"According to this tradition, we all become“human”because we all know at least one language."
8860,然而，“掌握”一种语言，究竟是什么意思呢？,But what does it mean to“know”a language?
8861,"在所有语言中, 某些词语和表达的指称完全依赖于话语的情境语境, 只能根据这些情境来理解。","In all languages, the reference of certain words and expressions relies entirely on the situational context of the utterance, and can only be understood in light of these circumstances."
8861,"语用学的这个层面称为指示功能(发音为 ""dike-sis"")。",This aspect of pragmatics is called deixis (pronounced “dike-sis”).
8861,代词是指示的。,Pronouns are deictic.
8861,它们的指称 (或缺乏指称) 最终取决于上下文。下面这样的词语:this person (这个人) these women (这些女人)that man ( 那个男人) those children (那些孩子)也是直指的，因为需要情景信息才能使听话者建立一个指称上的连接来理解其意义。,"Their reference (or lack of same) is ultimately context dependent.Expressions such asthis person that manthese women those children are also deictic, because they require situational information for the listener to make a referential connection and understand what is meant."
8861,这些例子说明了人称指示语的用法。,These examples illustrate person deixis.
8861,它们还表明，像this和that这样的指示冠词也是直指的。,They also show that the demonstrative articles like this and that are deictic.
8862,过去的几百年来，人们总是害怕他们创造的东西会比他们聪明、比他们有力量，或使他们失业。,"For centuries, people have been terrified that their programmed creations might outsmart them, overpower them, or put them out of work."
8862,这个恐惧在科幻小说中最常出现，从中古世纪犹太人的高伦传说——一个陶土做的泥人，因为把上帝的名字刻在他的嘴里而有了生命，到无所不能的海尔，这是电影《2001年太空漫游》里的电脑。,"The fear has long been played out in fiction, from the medieval Jewish legend of the Golem, a clay automaton animated by an inscription of the name of God placed in its mouth, to HAL, the mutinous computer of 2001: A Space Odyss."
8862,"但是当50年代工科中一个名为“人工智慧”的分支诞生时,人们感到科幻电影中那些恐怖事情快要成真了。","But when the branch of engineering called ''articial intelligence'' (Al) was born in the 1950s, it looked as though fiction was about to turn into frightening fact."
8863,虽然这是一个非常重要的问题，但现在对此还说不出什么来。,"Although this is a very important question, there is very little that can be said about it today."
8863,例如，有人可能会考虑人是怎样获得三维空间的某一概念这样的问题，或者用类似的话说，会考虑一种隐含的“人类行动理论”这样的问题。,"One might, for example, consider the problem of how a person comes to acquire a certain concept of three-dimensional space, or an implicit “theory of human action,” in similar terms."
8863,这种研究将会首先试图描写在实际行为底层的隐含理论的特征，然后转向这样一个问题：该理论在给定的时间和可得资料的条件下是如何发展的？即最后所得到的信念系统是如何由所得资料、“启发式程序”以及那些限制和支配所获得的系统的形式的先天图式，这三者间的相互作用所确定的。,"Such a study would begin with the attempt to characterize the implicit theory that underlies actual performance and would then turn to the question of how this theory develops under the given conditions of time and access to data – that is, in what way the resulting system of beliefs is determined by the interplay of available data, “heuristic procedures,” and the innate schematism that restricts and conditions the form of the acquired system."
8864,这当然使他和维柯直接联系了起来，这种联系可以从以下两点得到证实：即列维-斯特劳斯的最终目的是要创立关于人的普遍科学而且他的基本信念是“人创造了他们自己，就象他们创造了家畜的种类一样，唯一的区别在于前一过程不那么自觉或主动。,"This  of  course  links  him  directly with  Vico,  a  connection  confirmed  by  his  ultimate  aim  to  produce  a ‘general  science  of  man’  as  well  as  by  his  basic  conviction  that  ‘men have made themselves to no less an extent than they have made the races of  their  domestic  animals,  the  only  difference  being  that  the  process has  been  less  conscious  or  voluntary’."
8864,"同样的关注使他和马克思的思想也有联系，列维-斯特劳斯用这样一句活承认了这种联系，他说，""马克思的那句名言""人们创造自己的历史，但是他们并不知道他们正在创 造历史’，首先证明了历史的合理性，其次，证明了人类学的合理性。”","The  same  concern  also  links him with the thinking of Marx and Lévi-Strauss has acknowledged that connection  in  his  remark  that  ‘the  famous  statement  by  Marx,  “men make their own history, but they do not know that they are making it” justifies first, history, and second, anthropology’ ."
8865,人民性的品质对于美学与政治都具有核心意义。,The quality of narodnost’ (‘popularity’) is central to both the aesthetics and the politics.
8865,任何时代的艺术品，只要能表达一种高层次的社会意识，揭示一个特定时代真实的社会状况和情感，就获得了人民性。,"A work of art of any period achieves this quality by expressing a high level of social awareness, revealing a sense of the true social conditions and feelings of a particular epoch."
8865,这样的作品也将具有一种“进步的”面貌，从目前的情形瞥见未来的发展，从劳动人民大众的观点看到社会发展的理想图景。,"It will also possess a ‘progressive’ outlook, glimpsing the developments of the future in the lineaments of the present, and giving a sense of the ideal possibilities of social development from the point of view of the mass of working people."
8866,这一过程中存在着避免过早地把文本意义封闭，让文本与一般语言的差异、形式特征和无定性的语义游戏得到最充分的展开这样一种愿望。,"There is here, however, a desire to avoid premature foreclosure, to allow the text to differentiate itself from ordinary language, to grant maximum scope to the play of formal features and of semantic uncertainties."
8866,我们非但不去解决理解主题或某人物对某问题的陈述方面的困难，反而故意保留这些困难，而我们的注意力则放在文本组织上，当作对某些其他问题的说明。,Instead of attempting to resolve difficulties so as to produce themes or statements by a persona about a particular problem one may seek to preserve those difficulties by organizing the text as an illustration of certain problems.
8866,这一切的最高层次就是说明语言本身的问题。,At the highest level they are problems of language itself.
8867,叙述的快乐、满足是与欲望相关联的。,The pleasure of narrative is linked to desire.
8867,"情节讲述的是欲望和欲望的命运,而叙述本身的发展是受以强烈的“认识欲”的形式出现的欲望驱使的，是想知道的欲望：我们想要发现秘密，想要了解结局，想要掌握真情。","Plots tell of desire and what befalls it, but the movement of narrative itself is driven by desire in the form of ‘epistemophilia’, a desire to know: we want to discover secrets, to know the end, to find the truth."
8867,如果说是这种要主宰一切的“男性”冲动驱使着叙述，驱使着揭晓真相（赤裸裸的真相）的欲望，那么叙述提供给我们的，可以满足那个愿望的知识是不是欲望的结果呢？,"If what drives narrative is the ‘masculine’ urge to mastery, the desire to unveil the truth (the ‘naked truth’), then what of the knowledge that narrative offers us to satisfy that wish?Is that knowledge itself an effect of desire?"
8867,理论家们要探究关于欲望、故事和知识之间的关系这类问题。,"Theorists ask such questions about the links between desire, stories, and knowledge."
8868,“现在”这个短语就像Mount-castle所说的“尚未”一样，表达了一种对正常科学发展情况下可能很快会发生的降幅的期待。,"The phrase “at present,” like Mount-castle’s word “yet,” expresses the expectation that the reduction should take place in the normal course of scientific progress, perhaps soon."
8868,在物理学和化学领域，这一点从未发生过：所发生的只是几乎毫无变化的化学与不断修正的物理学之间的联合。,"In the case  of physics and chemistry, it never did: what happened was unification of a virtually unchanged chemistry with a radically revised physics."
8868,根本没必要补充说，八十年前人们对这些领域的理解及所达到的成就远超当今大脑科学与认知科学。,It’s hardly necessary to add that the state of understanding and achievement in those areas eighty years ago was far beyond anything that can be claimed for the brain and cognitive sciences today.
8868,因此，认定人们已理解的内容会不断发生“降幅”，这并不合适。,Hence confidence in “reduction” to the little that is understood is not necessarily appropriate.
8869,35年前，一个新的科学诞生了，我们称之为“认知科学”。它结合了心理学、电子计算机学、语言学、哲学和神经生物学，试图解释人的智力活动是怎么一回事。,"Some thirty-five years ago a new science was born.Now called ''cognitive science,"" it combines tools from psychology, computer science, linguistics, philosophy, and neurobiology to explain the workings of human intelligence."
8869,自此之后，语言的科学进步神速，我们对于许多语言现象的了解，差不多和我们对照相机或脾脏的功能一样清楚。,"The science of language, in particular, has seen spectacular advances in the years since.There are many phenomena of language that we are coming to understand nearly as well as we understand how a camera works or what the spleen is for."
8870,另一套是日语汉字，是一种表意文字，每个符号对应着一个词（详见第十二章对文字的讨论）。,"The other system, kanji, is ideographic; each symbol corresponds to a word.(More about this in chapter 12 on writing systems.)"
8870,日语汉字的基础不是日语的语音。,Kanji is not based on the sounds of the language.
8870,大脑左半球受损的日本人阅读假名的能力有障碍，而右半球受损的日本人则是阅读日语汉字的能力有障碍。,"Japanese people with left-hemisphere damage are impaired in their ability to read kana, whereas people with right-hemisphere damage are impaired in their ability to read kanji."
8870,对正常日语说话者进行的实验也表明，阅读日语汉字时大脑右半球比左半球处理得更准确一些，也更快一些，假名的情况则正好相反。,"Also, experiments with unimpaired Japanese readers show that the right hemisphere is better and faster than the left hemisphere at reading kanji, and vice versa."
8871,现在我们可以用带声性、鼻音性、调音部位和调音方式来区别英语中所有的辅音。,"We are now capable of distinguishing all of the consonant sounds of English via the properties of voicing, nasality, and place and manner of articulation."
8871,例如，[f]是唇齿清（口）擦音；[n]是龈（带）鼻塞音。,"For example, [f] is a voiceless, (oral), labiodental fricative; [n] is a (voiced), nasal, alveolar stop."
8871,括号中的特征一般由于冗余而未被提及。除非特别指出是鼻音之外，其他所有音都是口音；英语中所有鼻音都是带声的。,"The parenthesized features are usually not mentioned because they are redundant; all sounds are oral unless nasal is specifically mentioned, and all nasals are voiced in English."
8872,A栏中所有黑体元音都重读，元音音素都不一样，B栏中所有黑体元音都没有重读或弱化，而是读混元音[ə]。,In column A all the boldfaced vowels are stressed vowels with a variety of vowel phones; in column B the boldfaced vowels are without stress or reducedand are pronounced as schwa [ə].
8872,在这些例子中，单词的重音形式由于后缀不同而变化。,In these cases the stress pattern of the word varies because of the different suffixes.
8872,"在一种形式里重读的元音在另一种形式里会弱化, 因此发音为 [ə]。",The vowel that is stressed in one form becomes reduced in a different form and is therefore pronounced as [ə].
8872,"所有根语素的音位表征包含一个非弱化元音, 如/i/或/e/弱化时发音 [ə]。",The phonemic representations of all of the root morphemes contain an unreduced vowel such as /i/ or /e/ that is phonetically [ə] when it is reduced.
8873,一端是普通的观点，认为语言只是为独立存在的思维提供了名称，为先于它而存在的思维提供了表达方法；另一端是以两位语言学家的名字命名的“萨丕尔——沃尔夫假说”（Sapir-Whorf hypothesis)这两位语言学家认为我们所说的语言决定我们能够思维什么。,"At one extreme is the common-sense view that language justprovides names for thoughts that exist independently; language offersways of expressing pre-existing thoughts.At the other extreme is the ‘Sapir-Whorf hypothesis’, named after two linguists who claimed that the language we speak determines what we can think."
8873,比如，沃尔夫提出印第安霍皮族（Hopi）有一种关于时间的概念，在英语里就找不到这种概念。（所以英语就无法表达它！）,"For instance, Whorf argued that the Hopi Indians have a conception of time that can’tbe grasped in English (and so can’t be explained here!)."
8874,塞擦音[tʃ]和[dʒ]，发音时先成阻，紧接着是一个较慢的除阻，造成了擦音的效果。,Affricates [tʃ] [dʒ] These sounds are produced by a stop closure followed immediately by a gradual release of the closure that produces an effect characteristic of a fricative.
8874,在church（教堂）和judge（判断）两词的起音和收音分别是硬腭清塞擦音和硬腭带塞擦音。,"The palatal sounds that begin and end the words church and judge are voiceless and voiced affricates, respectively."
8874,塞擦音不是通音，因为它在开头有阻塞。,Affricates are not continuants because of the initial stop closure.
8875,上面讨论了英语中的音素。,We have been discussing the sounds that occur in English.
8875,有些音素，包括有些塞音，其他语言中也有，而英语没有。,A variety of stop consonants occur in other languages but not in English.
8875,例如玻利维亚和秘鲁的盖丘亚语中有小舌塞音。发音时舌体后部往后伸与小舌接触造成完全闭塞。,"For example, in Quechua, spoken in Bolivia and Peru, uvular stops occur, where the back of the tongue is raised and moved rearward to form a complete closure with the uvula."
8876,这里肯定存在着某种普遍的句法原理，排除了60来源于62的可能性，而使我们把61作为60的基础。,There must be some general syntactic principle that rules against 62 as possible sources for 60 and that causes us to interpret 60 as based rather on 61.
8876,罗森堡提出，以上所涉及的是有关省略操作的某种条件—即“删节原理”，它粗略地规定嵌入命题中的主语可以被该命题外最靠近的那个名词短语所删去。这里的“远近”是以1’或2’这样的表征方式所表示的树枝数目来测量的。,"Rosenbaum suggests that what is involved is a certain condition on deletion operations, an “erasure principle” that prescribes roughly that the subject of an embedded proposition is deleted by the nearest noun phrase outside of this proposition, “nearness” being measured in terms of the number of branches in a representation such as 1'or 2'."
8877,伊格尔顿在他的文章中进一步探求了晚期资本主义中艺术和商品会合的观念。,"Eagleton, in his article, further pursues the idea of the convergence of art and commodity in late capitalism."
8877,马克思对金钱与交换价值的分析包含了“商品拜物教”的概念。,Marx’s analysis of money and exchange value included the concept of ‘commodity fetishism’.
8877,这个概念指的是人的劳动被转化成劳动产品时那个不断神秘化的过程；劳动时间赋予产品的价值被看作产品本身一个独立的、客观的性质。,This refers to the mystifying process by which human labour is transposed into its products: the value which labour time bestows upon products is seen as an independent and objective property of the products themselves.
8877,这种无法看清产品的本质归根结底是社会异化和剥削造成的。,This inability to see products for what they are is at the root of social alienation and exploitation.
8878,洋泾浜的大多数词汇都来自于主流群体的语言。,Most of the lexical items of the pidgin come from the language of the dominant group.
8878,这种语言称为上层语言。,This language is called superstrate or lexifier language.
8878,"例如, 英语(种植园主的语言) 是夏威夷洋泾浜英语的上层语言,斯瓦希里语是在东非和中非所讲的各种形式的洋泾浜斯瓦希里语, 以及在马来西亚、新加坡和印尼所讲的巴刹马来语。","For example, English (the language of the plantation owners) is the superstrate language for Hawaiian Pidgin English, Swahili for the various forms of Pidgin Swahili spoken in East and Central Africa, and Bazaar Malay for pidgins spoken in Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia."
8879,清音可以是送气的或不送气的。,Voiceless sounds may also be aspirated or unaspirated.
8879,发送气音时除阻后声带还分开一会儿，结果有一股气流冲出。,"In the production of aspirated sounds, the vocal cords remain apart for a brief time after the stop closure is released, resulting in a puff of air at the time of the release."
8879,辅音还可按照某些特征组成更大的类，如唇音、舌冠音、前腔音、咝音等。,"Consonants may be grouped according to certain features to form larger classes such as labials, coronals, anteriors, and sibilants."
8880,阿尔都塞避免使用诸如“社会体制”、“秩序”之类的术语，因为这些术语暗示了一种具有中心的结构，这个中心决定了所有由它辐射出的部分的形式。,"Althusser avoids terms such as ‘social system’ and ‘order’, because they suggest a structure with a centre which determines the form of all its emanations."
8880,他多用的术语则是“社会生成”（social formation）之类，在他看来，这一说法表示一种“无中心的”结构。,"Instead he talks of the ‘social formation’, which he regards as a ‘decentred’ structure."
8880,与有生命的机体不同，这样的结构没有主导原则，没有起源的种子，没有总体的统一性。,"Unlike a living organism this structure has no governing principle, no originating seed, no overall unity."
8881,当然，社会主义批评和女权主义批评关心发展一些适于其目标的理论和方法：他们考虑写作与性之间的关系或本文与意识形态等问题，而其他一些理论对此并不加以考虑。,"Socialist criticism and feminist criticism are, of course, concerned with developing theories and methods appropriate to their aims: they consider questions of the relations between writing and sexuality, or of text and ideology, as other theories in general do not."
8881,他们肯定也会宣称这些理论比其他一些理论具有更强的解释力；因为，假如这些理论并非如此，将其作为理论提出就没有什么意义。,"They will also want to claim that these theories are more powerfully explanatory than others, for if they were not there would be no point in advancing them as theories."
8881,但是，如果认为这些批评的特殊性仅在于提出了另外一些可行的理论和方法，那也是错误的。,But it would be a mistake to see the particularity of such forms of criticism as consisting in the offering of alternative theories of methods.
8881,这些批评不同于其他批评是因为它们为自己规定了不同的对象，它们有不同的价值标准、信念和若干目标，并为实现这些目标而制定了不同的战略。,"These forms of criticism differ from others because they define the object of analysis differently, have different values, beliefs and goals, and thus offer different kinds of strategy for the realizing of these goals."
8882,西方的马克思主义批评往往是冒险的、令人振奋的，可是作为官方的共产主义“艺术方法”的社会主义现实主义对西方读者来说，就常常是枯燥的、狭隘的了。,"Marxist criticism written in the West has often been adventurous and exhilarating, but Socialist Realism, as the official Communist ‘artistic method’, seemed drab and blinkered to Western readers."
8882,前苏联作家联盟（1932-1934）阐发的基本原则采用了列宁革命前提出又在随后的20年代给予解释的某些论述。,The doctrines expounded by the Union of Soviet Writers (1932-4) appealed to certain of Lenin’s pre-Revolutionary statements as these were interpreted during the 1920s.
8882,这些原则涉及了文学的进化、文学对阶级关系的反映以及文学在社会中的作用等主要问题。,"The theory addressed certain major questions about the evolution of literature, its reflection of class relations and its function in society."
8883,结构主义人类学家克劳德·列维－施特劳斯在分析俄底浦斯神话时，采用了真正结构主义的语言学模式。,"Claude Lévi-Strauss, the structuralist anthropologist, analyses the Oedipus myth in a manner which is truly structuralist in its use of the linguistic model."
8883,他借鉴语言学中的音素和词素，把神话中的单元叫做“神话素”（mytheme）。,He calls the units of myth ‘mythemes’ (compare phonemes and morphemes in linguistics).
8883,这些神话素像基本的语言单元一样根据二元对立的原则结构在一起（见前文）。,"They are organized in binary oppositions (see above, p. 65) like the basic linguistic units."
8884,和前一版一样，本书配有细节极为丰富的磁共振成像(MRI)和正电子发射断层成像（PET)的人脑扫描图像。本章还重点介绍了过去儿年间神经语言学研究取得的一些惊人的新成果。,"As in the previous edition, highly detAn introduction to languageed illustrations of MRI and PET scans of the brain are included, and this chapter highlights some of the new results and tremendous progress in the study of neurolinguistics over the past few years."
8884,对于语言在人脑中的自主性本书作了细致的论证，以便学生明白如何应用实验证据来支持科学理论。,The arguments for the autonomy of language in the human brain are carefully crafted so that the student sees how experimental evidence is applied to support scientific theories.
8885,脑是人体中最复杂的器官。,The brain is the most complex organ of the body.
8885,它位于颅骨之下，由大约100亿个神经细胞（神经元）和数十亿条将神经细胞相互连接在一起的神经纤维组成。,It lies under the skull and consists of approximately 100 billion nerve cells (neurons) and billions of fibers that interconnect them.
8885,脑的表层是皮质，通常称为“灰质”， 由几十亿个神经元构成。,"The surface of the brain is the cortex, often called “gray matter,” consisting of billions of neurons."
8886,我们对付我们不能实现的欲望的一个方法是使之“升华”。弗洛伊德所说的“升华”，指的是把欲望引向为社会更加推崇的目标。,"One way in which we cope with desires we cannot fulfill is by 'sublimating' them, by which Freud means directing them towards a more socially valued end."
8886,我们可以通过建造桥梁与大教堂来使我们受挫性欲无意识地得到宣泄。,We might find an unconscious outlet for sexual frustration in building bridges or cathedrals.
8886,对于弗洛伊德来说，文明本身就是依靠这样的升华产生的：驾驭我们的本能并将其转用于这些更高的目标，就创造了文化历史本身。,"For Freud, it is by virtue of such sublimation that civilization itself comes about: by switching and harnessing our instincts to these higher goals, cultural history itself is created."
8887,所有这一切并非没有意义。,The whole matter is not without interest.
8887,我在前面曾讲过，在17世纪的观念和今日的认知心理学及语言学之间存在着惊人的相似。,I mentioned earlier that there are striking similarities between the seventeenth-centur yclimate of opinion and that of contemporary cognitive psychology and linguistics.
8887,其中一点恰好与解释理论的问题有关。,One point of similarity has to do with precisely this matter of explanatory theory.
8887,哲学语法与现行的生成语法很相象，它自觉地形成描述传统的反向；这种描述传统把语法学家的任务仅仅理解为记录和组织语言用法的资料，即一种自然历史。,"Philosophical grammar, very much like current generative grammar, developed in self-conscious opposition to a descriptive tradition that interpreted the task of the grammarian to be merely that of recording and organizing the data of usage – a kind of natural history."
8888,最后，应该谈一谈诺姆·乔姆斯基。,"Finally, one should say a word about Noam Chomsky."
8888,尽管某些结构主义者在他们的后期著作中采用了他的某些术语，生成语法在结构主义的发展过程中却没有发挥什么作用。,"Although a few structuralists have in their later work adopted some of his terms, generative grammar plays no role in the development of structuralism."
8888,它所提供的是一种颇具示范性的方法论的陈述，在我们的讨论中，它的重要性正在这里。,"What it does offer, and what gives it its importance in this discussion, is a methodological statement of exemplary clarity."
8888,易言之，乔姆斯基的语言理论能使我们了解，结构主义语言学家究竟在干什么，他们的实践有何意义，他们对自己学科所作的叙述为什么会引起误解或令人感到不足。,"That is to say, Chomsky’s theory of language enables us to see what structural linguists were actually doing, what their practice implied, and how their accounts of their discipline were misleading or insufficient."
8889,华兹华斯写下了许多最优秀的诗篇，其中包括《序曲》中一些髙潮性诗段。把热情、生命 和相貌强行加诸于自然景色，这种做法是许多浪漫主义大师所共 有的少数几个特点之一。,"Wordsworth devoted a number of his best poems and the climactic passages of the Prelude, The habitual reading of passion, life, and physiognomy into the landscape is one of the few salient attributes common to most of the major romantic poets."
8889,与此相应，文学批评也将传统视为一种修辞格的拟人法——即赋予自然对象的真实生命，将其当成最髙的想象力的主要标志，并且几乎认为，想象力本身就足以表达 最佳诗歌。,"Correspondingly, in literary criticism the valid animation of natural objects, traditionally treated as one form of the rhetorical device of prosopopoeia, or personification now came to be a major index to the sovereign faculty of imagination, and almost in itself a suffcient criterion of the highest poetry."
8890,我想谈谈所谓的“生物语言学视角”。它于半个世纪前在几个研究生的讨论中成形。这些学生在战后初期受到生物学和数学领域发展成果的极大影响，也包括逐渐在美国为人所知的行为学。,"I would like to say a few words about what has come to be called “the biolinguistic perspective,”which began to take shape half a century ago in discussions among a few graduate students who were much influenced by developments in biology and mathematics in the early postwar years, including work in ethology that was just coming to be known in the United States."
8890,埃里克·勒纳伯格就是这些学生之一。他出版于1967年的重要研究成果《语言的生物学基础》仍然是该领域的基本著作。,"One of them was Eric Lenneberg, whose seminal 1967 study Biological Foundations of Language remains a basic document of the field."
8890,彼时，相当多的交流活动也在发展中，包括跨领域研讨会和国际学术会议等。,"By then considerable interchange was proceeding, including interdisciplinary seminars and international conferences."
8890,影响力最大的当属1974年首届“生物语言学”会议。,"The most far-reaching one, in 1974, was called, for the first time, “Biolinguistics.”"
8890,该会议上提出的诸多前沿问题至今仍然处于热议之中。,Many of the leading questions discussed there remain very much alive today.
8891,说出来的一个语句，首先是说话人脑/心中的一条信息。,A spoken utterance starts as a message in the speaker's brain/mind.
8891,该信息转换成语言形式并被解读为一条说话指令， 以声学信号的形式出现。,"It is put into linguistic form and interpreted as articulation commands, emerging as an acoustic signal."
8891,信号经听话人耳朵的处理后，发送至他的脑/心，在那里得到解读。,"The signal is processed by the listener’s ear and sent to the brain/mind, where it is interpreted."
8892,语音科学试图描写世界上所有语言中所用的所有的音。,The science of phonetics attempts to describe all of the sounds used in all languages of the world.
8892,声学语音学关注语音的物理属性；听觉语音学关注听者如何感知语音。发音语音学研究的则是声道如何发出语音，这也是本章的主题。,Acoustic phonetics focuses on the physical properties of sounds; auditory phonetics is concerned with how listeners perceive these sounds; and articulatory phonetics—the primary concern of this chapter—is the study of how the vocal tract produces the sounds of language.
8893,可是，抒情诗则往往可以从整体上去把握，无须涉及历时发展顺序；无须自A至B的运动。格莱麦写道，尤其是现代诗歌，它是“分类系统的散漫显现”。,"Lyrics, however, may often be grasped as a whole without any reference to temporal development; there need be no movement from A to B. Modern poetry in particular, Greimas writes, is the 'discursive manifestation of a taxonomy'."
8893,读者所接触的短语或意象，均以原生的、散漫的状态联系在一起，他必须从中提取可用于把文本组织成两两相对类型的种种特征。,"The reader is faced with phrases or images, linked in rudimentary discursive fashion, from which he must extract features that he can use to organize the text into oppositional classes."
8894,句子中的NP主语和VP中的论元在语义上以各种方式与动词相关联。,"The NP arguments in the VP, which include the subject and any objects, are semantically related in various ways to the verb."
8894,这些关系取决于这个特定动词的意义。,The relations depend on the meaning of the particular verb.
8894,例如，在下面句子中的NP the boy (那个男孩)：(1) The boy rolled a red ball.,"For example, the NP the boy in the sentence: 1."
8894,（那个男孩(施事)滚动一个红色的球(主位)。,The boy (agent) rolled a red ball (theme).
8894,）是滚动动作的“行使者”又称“施事”，NP a red ball （—个红色的球）是滚动动作的主位，或“经受者”。,"is the “doer” of the rolling action, also called the agent.The NP a red ball is the theme or the “undergoer” of the rolling action."
8894,像施事、主位和其他我们马上要提到的关系都称为题元角色。,Relations such as agent and theme are called thematic roles.
8895,"言语行为理论告诉我们,人们用语言做事,比如打赌、提出警告,或者提名候选人。","The theory of speech acts tells us that people use language to do things such as lay bets, issue warnings, or nominate candidates."
8895,通过“我提名比尔•史密斯”这句话，你可能就完成了一个提名行为，让比尔•史密斯可以竞选公职。,"By using the words “I nominate Bill Smith,” you may accomplish an act of nomination that allows Bill Smith to run for office."
8895,“做事”的动词称为施行动词。,Verbs that “do things” are called performative verbs.
8896,在所有这些句子中，说话者是主语(即句子是第一人称)。,"In all of these sentences, the speaker is the subject (i.e."
8896,"主语通过说这些句子来完成一些别的行为,如挑战、提名或辞职。",", the sentences are in first person), who by uttering the sentence is accomplishing some additional action, such as daring, nominating, or resigning."
8896,此外，所有这些句子都是现在时的肯定陈述句。,"In addition, all of these sentences are affirmative, declarative, and in the present tense."
8896,它们是典型的施行句。,They are typical performative sentences.
8897,究其原因也不难：文学作品的形式和篇幅各有不同，而且大多数作品似乎与通常被认为不属于文学作品的东西有更多的相同之处，而与那些被公认为是 学作品的相同之点反倒不多。,The reasons are not far to seek: works of literature come in all shapes and sizes and most of them seem to have more incommon with works that aren’t usually called literature than they do with some other works recognized as literature.
8897,以夏洛蒂·勃朗特的《简爱》为例，它更像是一篇自传，与十四行诗很少有相似之处；而罗勃特·彭斯（Robert Burns)的一首诗“我的爱就像一朵红红的玫瑰”则更像一首民谣，与莎士比亚的《哈姆雷特》也很少有共同之处。,"Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre, for instance, more closely resembles an autobiography than it does a sonnet, and a poem by Robert Burns – ‘My love is like a red, red rose’ –resembles a folk-song more than it does Shakespeare’s Hamlet."
8897,那么，诗歌、剧本、小说是否有一些共同的持点使它们与歌谣、对话的文字记录，以及自传区别开来呢？,"Are there qualities shared by poems, plays, and novels that distinguish them from, say, songs, transcriptions of conversations, and autobiographies?"
8898,时装具有特别复杂的符号意义，可以同时具有社会的、政治的、性的和审美的功能。,"Fashions are especially complex signs and may possess social, political, erotic and aesthetic functions."
8898,文学产品同样具有多种功能。,The same variability of function can be seen in literary products.
8898,一篇政治演讲稿、一篇传记、一封信和一件宣传品在不同的社会和时代可能有审美功能，也可能没有审美功能。,"A political speech, a biography, a letter and a piece of propaganda may or may not possess aesthetic value in different societies and periods."
8898,“艺术”范畴的周边界限总是在变化着，而且总是与某种社会结构发生着动态的关联。,"The circumference of the sphere of ‘art’ is always changing, and always dynamically related to the structure of society."
8899,利维斯的各字与“实用批评”和“仔细阅读”紧密相联；他所发表的一些著作堪入本世纪最明敏的、具有开创性的英国文学批评之列。,"Leavis's name is closely associated with 'practical criticism' and 'close read- ing', and some of his own published work ranks with the most subtle, pioneering English criticism that the century has seen."
8899,“实用批评”这个词值得稍加深入地思考。,It is worth pondering this term 'practical criticism' a little further.
8899,实用批评意味着一种方法，它摒弃辞藻华丽的纯文学空话，完全不惮于分解作品；但是它也假定，只要将注意集中于脱离其文化和历史背景的诗或散文作品，你就可以判断文学的“伟犬性”和“中心性”。,Practical criticism meant a method which spurned belle-lettristic waffle and was properly unafraid to take the text apart; but it also assumed that you could judge literary 'great- ness' and 'centrality' by bringing a focused attentiveness to bear on poems or pieces of prose isolated from their cultural and historical contexts.
8900,史诗中有口头吟诵：诗人直接面对听众。,"In epic, there is oral recitation: a poet directly confronting the listening audience."
8900,在戏剧中，剧作家看不到观众，而是由舞台上的角色去叙述。,"In drama, the author isconcealed from the audience and the characters on stage talk."
8900,"抒情诗的情况最复杂，诗人或唱或吟诵，可以说是背对听众的，“做出自言自语或对其他什么人讲话的样子：也许是对大自然中的一个精灵, 对缪斯，对一位朋友，对一个情人、一个神灵、一个人格化了的抽象事物，或是某个自然的对象”。","In lyric–the most complicated case–the poet, in singing or chanting, turns his back on his listeners, so to speak, and ‘pretends to be talking to himself or to someone else: a spirit of Nature, a Muse, a personal friend, a lover, a god, a personified abstraction, or a natural object’."
8900,我们还可以把小说这个现代体裁加到这三个基本体裁当中去。小说通过一部书与读者交谈——我们将在第六章专门论述这个题目。,"To these three elementary genres we can add the modern genre of the novel, which addresses the reader through a book–a topic we’ll take up in Chapter 6."
8901,主要在法国活动的罗马尼亚理论家路西安·哥德曼（Lucien Goldmann）不赞成文本是天才个人的创造的观点，他争辩说，文本的创造是来自特定集团（或阶级）的那种“超个人的精神结构”。,"Lucien Goldmann, a Romanian theorist based in France, rejected the idea that texts are creations of individual genius and argued that they are based upon ‘trans-individual mental structures’ belonging to particular groups or classes)."
8901,这样的“世界观”处在永恒的建构与消解中，因为拥有这些世界观的社会集团为回应不断变化的现实要不断调整他们关于世界的精神形象。,These ‘world-views’ are perpetually being constructed and dissolved by social groups as they adjust their mental image of the world in response to the changing reality before them.
8901,这样的精神形象在一般社会活动分子的意识中往往不能获得清晰的界定和完全的认识，只有伟大的作家们能够把这样的世界观清晰地凝聚在透明而有机的形中。,Such mental images usually remain ill-deﬁned and half-realized in the consciousness of social agents but great writers are able to crystallize world-views in a lucid and coherent form.
8902,在一些情景中，“乐队排练，我家，6点到8点”是一句提醒，但同样的句子在不同的语境下可能变成警告。,"In some situations Band practice, my house, 6 to 8 is a reminder, but the same sentence may be a warning in a different context."
8902,这些我们称之为“隐含的目的”或“说话者意图”——可能是一个提醒、警告、承诺、威胁或别的什么，也就是言语行为的示意语力。,"We call this underlying purpose of the utterance—be it a reminder, a warning, a promise, a threat, or whatever— the illocutionary force of a speech act."
8902,因为言语行为的示意语力取决于说话的语境，所以言语行为理论是语用学的一部分。,"Because the illocutionary force of a speech act depends on the context of the utterance, speech act theory is a part of pragmatics."
8903,我们可以得出这样的结论，文学是一种可以引起某种关注的言语行为，或者叫文本事件。,"Literature, we might conclude, is a speech act or textual event that elicits certain kinds of attention."
8903,它与其他种类的言语行为不同，比如告知信息、提出问题或者做出承诺等。,"It contrasts with other sorts of speech acts, such as imparting information, asking questions, or making promises."
8903,大多数情况下是读者发现了那种可以把一些文字定义为文学的语境，从而才把这些文字视为文学，比如他们在一本诗集、一份杂志的某一部分，或者图书馆和书店里看到的那些东西。,"Most of the time what leads readers to treat something as literature is that they find it in a context that identifies it as literature: in a book of poems or a section of a magazine, library, or bookstore."
8904,其中一条叫作适量准则说，说话者所提供的话语应按照要求提供信息一一不多也不少。,"One such maxim, the maxim of quantity, states that a speaker’s contribution to the discourse should be as informative as is required—neither more nor less."
8904,哈姆雷特在多和少两个方向上都违反了这一原则。,Hamlet has violated this maxim in both directions.
8904,他用“空话，空话，空话”来回答他在读什么这个问题，提供的信息太少。,"In answering “Words, words, words” to the question of what he is reading, he is providing too little information."
8905,衍推的概念经常被用来揭示我们关于其他语义关系的知识。,The notion of entAn introduction to languagement can be used to reveal knowledge that we have about other meaning relations.
8905,"比如说,不考虑同义反复句和矛盾句，如果两个句子在相同的情况下同时为真或者同时为假，这两个句子就是同义句（或者是释义句）。","For example, omitting tautologies and contradictions, two sentences are synonymous (or paraphrases) if they are both true or both false with respect to the same situations."
8905,像“杰克推迟了会议”和“杰克推后了会议”就是同义句，因为当其中一句为真时，另一句也必然为真；当其中一句为假时，另一句也必然为假。,"Sentences like Jack put off the meeting and Jack postponed the meeting are synonymous, because when one is true the other must be true; and when one is false the other must also be false."
8906,中国政府采用了一种罗马字母的拼写系统，称为拼音。现在拼音与汉字系统同时使用，以针对一些特定的目的。,"The Chinese government has adopted a spelling system using the Roman alphabet called Pinyin, which is now used alongside the regular system of characters."
8906,城市街道上的许多指示牌既有汉字也有拼音，方便了外国旅游者。,"By the time of the Summer Olympics of 2008, nearly all public information signs in Beijing, such as the names of streets, parks, restaurants, hotels, and shopping centers, were printed in both systems for the convenience of foreign visitors."
8906,政府并不想让汉语拼音取代传统的汉字，而是把汉字看作中国文化的一个组成部分。,"It is not the government’s intent to replace the traditional writing, which is an integral part of Chinese culture."
8906,此外，对中国人来说，汉字书写是一种艺术—即书法；几千年来的诗歌、文学、历史都保存在古老的文字系统中。,"To the Chinese, writing is an art—calligraphy—and thousands of years of poetry, literature, and history are preserved in the old system."
8907,巴尔特没有讨论情节的不稳定性，虽然这个问题已包括在阐释代码的范畴之内。,"Barthes does not discuss uncertainties of plot, though they do fall within the scope of the hermeneutic code."
8907,他基本上关注的是身份属性的疑点。,He is concerned primarily with mysteries of identity.
8907,书名往往变成这样的疑团：《米德尔马奇》一直读到第六章，我们才弄清它究竟是一个人，一个家族，一幢宅第，一座城市，还是一个主题隐喻。,"Titles tend to be enigmas of this kind: it is not until chapter 6 that we know whether Middlemarch is a person, a family, a house, a town or a thematic metaphor."
8908,我们已经按调音部位描写了几类辅音，但每一类内仍无法互相区别。,"We have described several classes of consonants according to their place of articulation, yet we are still unable to distinguish the sounds in each class from one another."
8908,例如[p]跟[b]有什么区别，[b]和[m]又有什么不同？,What distinguishes [p] from [b] or [b] from [m]?
8908,他们都是双唇音。,All are bilabial sounds.
8908,又如，同是龈音的[t]，[d]和[n]之间有什么区别？,"What is the difference between [t], [d], and [n], which are all alveolar sounds?"
8909,许多对双语现象的早期研究都集中讨论这样一个事实，即双语儿童有时会在同一个句子中混用两种语言。法英双语儿童所说的下列例句就说明了这一点。,"Much of the early research into bilingualism focused on the fact that bilingual children sometimes mix the two languages in the same sentences, as the following examples from French-English bilingual children illustrate."
8909,在第一个例子中，一个法语词出现在本该是英语的句子里。,"In the first example, a French word appears in an otherwise English sentence."
8909,在其他两个例子中，所用的词都是英语的，然而句法却是法语的。,"In the other two examples, all of the words are English but the syntax is French."
8910,那些假借读者思维和感情的混合型写作方式迩渐危及日益认识到两疔之间差别的现代意识。,Mixed modes of writing which enlist the reader’s feeling as well as his thinking are becoming dangerous to  the modern  consciousness  with  its  increasing awareness of  the  distinction.
8910,思想和感情目前会使彼此误入歧途，而六个世纪以前这些情况就不大可能发生，倘若这种合二为一的笔法确实再度受人欢迎，我们就需要更纯粹的科学和更纯粹的诗歌的魔力才能把作者与读者的思想感情混合起来。,"Thought  and  feeling  are  able  to mislead one another at present in ways which were hardly possible  six  centuries  ago.We  need  a  spell  of  purer  science  and purer poetry before the two can again be mixed, if indeed this will  ever  become  once  more  desirable."
8910,我在第二版中増加了一个讨论艾略特先生诗歌的附识，以便说明我这虽所谓的纯粹性，还有一些补充意见是谈论价值的。在第二版中修改了个别枝节问题。,"In  the  Second  Edition  I added a note on Mr. Eliot’s poetry which will elucidate what I mean  here  by  purity,  and  some  supplementary  remarks  upon Value; in the Third, a few minor improvements have been made."
8911,此外，[a]是紧元音，而 [ӕ]，[ʌ]，当然还有[ə]都 是松元音。,"Additionally, [a] is a tense vowel as are the diphthongs [aɪ] and [aʊ], but the diphthong [ɔɪ] is lax as are [ӕ], [ʌ], and of course [ə]."
8911,"紧元音可以出现于词末：[si]，[se]，[su]，[so]，[pa]表示的是英语词see, say, sue, sew, pa。","Tense vowels may occur at the ends of words: [si], [se], [su], [so], [pa], [saɪ], and [haʊ] represent the English words see, say, sue, sew, pa, sigh, and how."
8911,"松元音大多不能出现于词末，因此发音为[sɛ], [sʊ], [sæ], [sʌ]和[sə]的，都不可能是英语词。","Lax vowels mostly do not occur at the ends of words; [sɪ], [sɛ], [sʊ], [sæ], [sʌ], and [sə] are not possible words in En glish."
8911,以上概括的例外是松元音[ɔ]，它可以出现于saw [sɔ]等词中。,"(The one exception to this generalization is lax [ɔ] and its diphthong [ɔɪ], which occur in words such as [sɔ] (saw) and [sɔɪ] (soy).)"
8912,清音依声带关闭时间分为两类。按照声带关闭时间，清音可分成两类。,Voiceless sounds fall into two classes depending on the timing of the vocal cord closure.
8912,说pit这个词时，在双唇打开p除阻后声带还有一小段时间未关闭。,"When we say pit, the vocal cords remain open for a very short time after the lips come apart to release the p."
8912,这样的p叫作送气，因为在喉门关闭之前有一小股空气流出。,We call this p aspirated because a brief puff of air escapes before the glottis closes.
8913,然而，继续追究这个问题是没有意义的。因为，关键的问题并不在于结构语法的“简单性”，而是在于具有短语结构成分并在生成深层结构过程中起作用的转换语法的“简单性”。,"However, it is pointless to pursue this topic, because what is at stake is not the “simplicity” of phrase structure grammars but rather of transformational grammars with a phrase structure component that plays a role in generating deep structures."
8913,并且，也绝对不存在“容易计算”或“算法的简单性”这样的数学概念，能够哪怕是含糊地暗示，复合这种概念的系统优于从这种观点的角度认真地考察过的多种自动机——例如，有限状态自动机、线性有界自动机等等。,"And there is absolutely no mathematical concept of “ease of computation” or “simplicity of algorithm” that even vaguely suggests that such systems may have some advantage over the kinds of automata that have been seriously investigated from this point of view – for example, finite state automata, linear bounded automata, and so on."
8914,有时，手语使用者需要表达的一个词或概念没有相应的手势。,There are occasions when signers need to represent a word or concept for which there is no sign.
8914,可以举出以下一些例子：新造词、外语词、缩略词、某些专用名词、科技术语，或是演绎手语版莎士比亚戏剧时可能会碰到的一些陈旧的废词。,"New coinages, foreign words, acronyms, certain proper nouns, technical vocabulary, or obsolete words as might be found in a signed interpretation of a play by Shakespeare are among some of these."
8914,针对这种情况，ASL提供了一系列手形和动作，用来代表英语字母，使得所有这样的词和概念都能通过手指拼写来表达。,"For such cases ASL provides a series of hand shapes and movements that represent the letters of the English alphabet, permitting all such words and concepts to be expressed through finger spelling."
8915,在句子“杰克游泳”中，我们知道“杰克”一词通常被称为专有名词，指的是世界上一件具体的东西，这就是它的指称。,"In the sentence Jack swims, we know that the word Jack, which is a proper name, refers to a precise object in the world, which is its referent."
8915,比如说，在上文给出的情景中，“杰克”的指称意义是你的一个朋友，他现在正很高兴地在游泳池里游泳。,"For instance, in the scenario given earlier, the referential meaning of Jack is the guy who is your friend and who is swimming happily in the pool right now."
8915,由此我们知道 “杰克”这个名字的意义是它所指的某一个体。,"Based on this, we conclude that the meaning of the name Jack is the individual it refers to."
8916,强力诗人们分别或连续采用六种心理防范形式来对付那种 “影响的焦虑”(anxiety of influence)。,Strong poets cope with the ‘anxiety of influence’ by adopting separately or suc- cessively six psychic defences.
8916,这些形式以比喻的形式出现在他们的诗歌中，使他们可以从父辈的诗歌中“转脱”出来。,These appear in their poetry as tropes which allow a poet to ‘swerve’ from a father’s poems.
8916,这六种比喻是：反讽、提喻、换喻、夸张/反语、隐喻、再换喻(metalepsis)。,"The six tropes are irony, synecdoche, metonymy, hyperbole/litotes, metaphor and metalepsis."
8916,布鲁姆使用了六个古典词语来表达父辈诗人与子辈诗人之间的六种关系（修正率）：克利纳门（clinamen）、苔莎拉（tessera）、克诺西斯（kenosis）、达门奈扎逊（daemonization）、阿斯克西斯（askesis）、阿波弗拉迪斯（apophrades）。,"Bloom uses six classical words to describe the six kinds of relationship between the texts of fathers and sons (revisionary ratios): clinamen, tessera, kenosis, daemonization, askesis and apophrades."
8917,音素与音位并不是不可分的单位。它们由语音特征组成，就像原子组成分子一样。,"Phones and phonemes are not indissoluble units; they are composed of phonetic features, similar to the way that molecules are composed of atoms."
8917,"因此对于音位/p/, /b/, /m/, 一个更明晰的描写可以由如下的特征矩阵给出。","A more explicit description of the phonemes /p/, /b/, and /m/ may thus be given in a feature matrix of the following sort."
8918,语音科学试图描写世界上所有语言中所用的所有的音。,The science of phonetics attempts to describe all of the sounds used in all languages of the world.
8918,声学语音学关注语音的物理属性；听觉语音学关注听者如何感知语音。发音语音学研究的则是声道如何发出语音，这也是本章的主题。,Acoustic phonetics focuses on the physical properties of sounds; auditory phonetics is concerned with how listeners perceive these sounds; and articulatory phonetics—the primary concern of this chapter—is the study of how the vocal tract produces the sounds of language.
8919,古代以修辞学的观点探讨诗歌的杰出典范是贺拉斯的《诗艺》。理查德•麦基翁说得好:“贺拉斯批评的主要用意是教诗人如何使他的听众端坐到底，如何博得喝采和掌声，如何使罗马听众高兴，又如何使得所有听众高兴，并使自己流芳百世。”,"The great classical exemplar of the application of the rhetorical point of view to poetry was, of course, the Ars Poetica of Horace, As Richard McKeon points out, ‘Horace's criticism is directed in the main to instruct the poet how to keep his audience in their scats until the end, how to induce cheers and applause, how to please a Roman audience, and by the same token, how to please all audiences and win immortality.’"
8920,"价值将会一落千丈,将会出现通俗趣味代替有素养的识别能力的重新估价这样设想可能为时过早。","It is perhaps premature to envisage a collapse of values, a transvaluation by which popular taste replaces trained discrimination."
8920,不过商业作风导致的现象更是千奇百怪:对电影和广播更加不摔的潜势我们至今还莫测高深。有些不大确定而又无疑为数不多的迹象表明，杨销作品姑且比较《泰山》与《她》），杂志上的韵文，壁炉架上的两器制品，科学院里拍的照片，音乐厅的歌曲，郡政会的大搂，烈士纪念碑……品位越来越低。,"Yet commercialism has done stranger things: we have not yet fathomed the more sinister potentialities of the cinema and the loud-speaker, and there is some evidence uncertain and slight no doubt, that such things as ‘best-sellers’ (compare Tarzan with She), magazine verses, mantelpiece pottery, Academy picture, Music Hall songs, County Council buildings, War Memorials . . . are decreasing in merit."
8920,有些时候固然出规引人注意的例外情况，这时大众要比专家更加明断，不过通常并非如此。,"Notable exceptions, in which the multitude are better advised than the experts, of course occur sometimes, but not often."
8921,在这个传统意义上的文化研究受着两种力量的紧张冲突的驱使，一种要复苏通俗文化，使其成为人民的表述，或者为边缘群体的文化扬声；另一种是对大众文化的研究，认为它是一种意识形态的强压，形成了压制性的意识形态。,"Cultural studies in this tradition is driven by the tension between the desire to recover popular culture as the expression of the people or give voice to the culture of marginalized groups, and the study of mass culture as an ideological imposition, an oppressive ideological formation."
8921,一方面，研究通俗文化就是要触及普通人生活中重要的东两——他们的文化——与唯美主义和教授们的文化相对立的文化。,"On the one hand, the point of studying popular culture is to get in touch with what is important for the lives of ordinary people – their culture – as opposed to that of aesthetes and professors."
8921,另一方面，又有一种强大的推动力要表明人民是如何被塑造的，或者说是如何被文化力量控制操纵的。,"On the other, there is a strong impetus to show how people are shaped or manipulated by cultural forces."
8922,塞音是发音时气流在口腔中被完全阻塞一小段时间（数十毫秒）。,Stops are consonants in which the airstream is completely blocked in the oral cavity for a short period (tens of milliseconds).
8922,塞音意外（以外）的是通音。,All other sounds are continuants.
8922,[t]是塞音，[s]是通音。,"The sound [t] is a stop, but the sound [s] is not, and that is what makes them dif- ferent speech sounds."
8923,元音鼻化规则是一条同化规则；它使一个音段同化另一个音段，靠的是“复制”或“传递”后继音位的某个特征，使得两个音段更为近似。,"The vowel nasalization rule is an assimilation rule, or a rule that makes neighboring segments more similar by duplicating a phonetic property."
8923,同化规则在大部分场合是由调音过程引起的。,"For the most part, assimilation rules stem from articulatory processes."
8923,说话时有一种倾向，总想提高调音省力水平，也就是高效地调音。,There is a tendency when we speak to increase the ease of articulation.
8924,改变鼻音性否定语素的调音部位与其后紧接的辅音的调音部位相一致。,Change the place of articulation of the nasal negative morpheme to agree with the place of articulation of a following consonant.
8924,上面描写的这条改变鼻辅音读音的规则可以被称为同位鼻音规则——“同位”指的是相同部位——因为鼻音的调音部位与其后紧接的辅音一致。,The rule that changes the pronunciation of nasal consonants as just illustrated is called the homorganic nasal rule—homorganic means “same place”—because the place of articulation of the nasal is the same as for the following consonant.
8924,同位鼻音规则是世界语言中的一条普遍规则。,The homorganic nasal rule is a common rule in the world’s languages.
8925,从理论上说，日语中所有的词和语素都可以用平假名来书写。,"In theory, all of Japanese could be written in hiragana."
8925,"但日语有许多同形异义词，如英语lead pipe(铅管）或lead astray(引入歧途）中的lead,而用日语汉字书写可以消除由这种用音节文字书写而造成的歧义，比如英语中的can在He saw that gasoline can explode (can“罐”：他看到汽油罐爆炸。/can“会”：他明白汽油会爆炸。）这一句子中产生的歧义。","However, in Japanese, there are many homographs (like lead in “lead pipe” or “lead astray”), and the use of kanji disambiguates a word that might be ambiguous if written syllabically, similar to the ambiguity of can in “He saw that gasoline can explode.”"
8926,这当中的重要人物是美国哲学家朱迪思·巴特勒（Judith Butler）。她的著作《性别的烦恼：女权主义和属性的破坏性》 （Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity，1990年）、《身体的重要性》（Bodies that Matter，1993年）和《令人兴奋的演说：言语行为的政治》（ Excitable Speech: A Politics of the Speech Act，1997年），在文学和文化领域都颇有影响，尤其在女权主义理论和正在兴起的同性恋研究领域影响很大。,"The key figure here is the American philosopher Judith Butler, whose books Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity (1990), Bodies that Matter (1993),and Excitable Speech: A Politics of the Speech Act (1997), have had great influence in the field of literary and cultural studies, particularly in feminist theory, and in the emerging field of gay and lesbian studies."
8926,“同性恋理论”（Queer Theory)最近已被男性同性恋研究领域中的先锋派所采纳。他们在文化理论中的活动与解放男同性恋者的政治运动相联系。,The name ‘Queer Theory’ has recently been adopted by the avant-garde of gay studies whose work in cultural theory is linked with political movements for gay liberation.
8926,它以此作为自己的名称，并且把同性恋者最常遇到的侮辱性语言回敬给社会，即“同性恋！”（Queer!)这个混号。,"It takes as its own name and throws back at society the most common insult that homosexuals encounter, the epithet ‘Queer!’"
8927,在地图上画出来的、将这些区域区分开来的线叫作同言线。,A line drawn on the map to separate the areas is called an isogloss.
8927,当你跨过一条同言线时，你就是从一个方言区进入了另一个方言区。,"When you cross an isogloss, you are passing from one dialect area to another."
8927,有时几条同言线恰好相交，通常发生在政治边界线上，或在河流、山脉这样的自然界线上。,"Sometimes several isoglosses coincide, often at a political boundary or at a natural barrier such as a river or mountain range."
8927,语言学家们把这些归类线条称作同言线束。,Linguists call these groupings a bundle of isoglosses.
8927,这样一个同言线束，就能够界定一种地域方言。,Such a bundle can define a regional dialect.
8928,诗歌以其难以琢磨的漫无目标、令人不解的构成方式愚弄或迷惑我们。“roll-rock highroad”是什么意思？,"Poems doodle or riddle us, in their wayward indirection, their puzzling formulations: what is a ‘rollrock highroad’?"
8928,“秘密坐在其中通晓一切”又是什么意思？,What of ‘the Secret that sits in the middle and knows’?
8928,"这种特点在童谣或民歌中十分突出。在童谣和民歌中快感是存在于韵律和重叠手法，以及一些稀奇古怪的形象之中的：豌豆粥儿烫，(Pease porridge hot,豌豆粥儿凉， Pease porridge cold,豌豆粥儿在锅里 Pease porridge in the pot,煮了九天九夜长。Nine days old.)","Such features are very prominent in nursery rhymes and ballads, where frequently pleasure lies in rhythm, incantation, and strangeness of image: Pease porridge hot,Pease porridge cold,Pease porridge in the pot,Nine days old."
8929,那种以为人类语言只不过是比在动物世界中见到的某种东西更复杂一些的特例的观点，似乎没有什么实质性内容。,There seems to be no substance to the view that human language is simply a more complex instance of something to be found elsewhere in the animal world.
8929,这就为生物学家提出了—个问题，因为如果情况果真如此，那么，这就是一个真正的“突现”的例子—在一个复杂组织的特定阶段出现不同质的现象。,"This poses a problem for the biologist, since, if true, it is an example of true “emergence” – the appearance of a qualitatively different phenomenon at a specific stage of complexity of organization."
8929,对于这一事实的了解—虽然是用完全不同的术语表示的—正是促使许多关注心理本性的人进行经典语言研究的动机。,"Recognition of this fact, though formulated in entirely different terms, is what motivated much of the classical study of language by those whose primary concern was then the nature of mind."
8930,无论在古代还是今天，图画文字在世界各地都有发现：非洲各部落、美洲土著（包括美国阿拉斯加和加拿大的因纽特人)、秘鲁的印加人、西伯利亚的尤卡吉尔人（Yukagirian)和大洋洲土著 。,"Pictographic writing has been found throughout the world, ancient and modern: among Africans, Native Americans including the Inuits of Alaska and Canada, the Incas of Peru, the Yukagirians of Siberia, and the people of Oceania."
8930,今天，国际通用的道路标志仍使用图画文字，因为并非所有的旅行者都懂当地语言。,"Pictograms are used today in international road signs, where the native language of the region might not be understood by all travelers."
8930,这种符号人人都能看懂，因为它们不依赖于任何语言。,
8930,,Such symbols do not depend on words.
8931,与现代文字不同，每一幅图或图画文字都是所代表事物的直接形象。,"Unlike modern writing systems, each picture or pictogram is a direct image of the object it represents."
8931,其符号的形式和意义之间有一种非任意的关系。,There is a nonarbitrary relationship between the form and meaning of the symbol.
8931,不带解说词的连环漫画也属于图画文字—— 即它们直接地表达了所要交流的思想。,Comic strips minus captions are pictographic— literal representations of the ideas to be communicated.
8932,列维-斯特劳斯在论原始人思维的两本重要著作《图腾制度》(1962年）和《野蛮人的思维》（1962年）中，对“零敲碎打”这一术语作了如下定义。,The term bricolage is defined in  Lévi-Strauss’ two major works on the primitive mind; Totemism (1962) and The Savage Mind (1962).
8932,它指的是所谓“原始人”没有文化、没有技术的思想对周围世界作出反应的手段。,"It refers to the means by which the non-literate, non-technical mind of so-called ‘primitive’ man responds to the world around him."
8932,这个过程包含一种“具体科学”（和我们“文明的”“抽象的”科学相对立）。这种科学远非缺乏逻辑，事实上，它以和我们不同的逻辑，仔细而精确地把这个丰富多彩的物质界的一分一毫都组合成结构，加以分类和排列。,"The process involves a ‘science of the concrete’ (as opposed to our ‘civilized’ science of the ‘abstract’) which, far from lacking logic, in fact carefully and precisely orders, classifies and arranges into structures the minutiae of the physical world in all their profusion by means of a ‘logic’ which is not our own."
8933,一些语言还有外接缀，指的是在同一个词基语素的开头和末尾附加上的语素，有时候也被称为非连续语素。,"Some languages have circumfixes, morphemes that are attached to a base morpheme both initially and finally.These are sometimes called discontinuous morphemes."
8933,在美国俄克拉荷马州有一种属于印第安土著马斯科吉语系的奇卡索语，词的否定形式通过前缀ik-和后缀-o共同组成。,"In Chickasaw, a Muskogean language spoken in Oklahoma, the negative is formed with both a prefix ik- and the suffix -o."
8933,在加上表示否定的后缀之前，肯定形式末尾的元音会先脱落。,The final vowel of the affirmative is dropped before the negative suffix is added.
8934,皮尔士认为归纳过程对知识获得是无关紧要的。用他的话说：“归纳方法没有创造性，它只能检验一个业已形成的假设。,"Peirce regarded inductive processes as rather marginal to the acquisition of knowledge; in his words, “Induction has no originality in it, but only tests a suggestion already made.”"
8934,”要理解皮尔士勾画出的唯理主义者心目中的知识获得问题，我们就必须洞察他称之为“外展方法”的秘密；我们就必须弄淸楚，是什么东西“把规则赋予外展方法，因而限制了可接受时假说，皮尔士认为，对外展原理的迫寻把我们引到对天赋观念的研究上，这种天赋观念提供了人类智力的本能结构。,"To understand how knowledge is acquired, in the rationalist view that Peirce outlined, we must penetrate the mysteries of what he called “abduction,” and we must discover which “gives a rule to abduction and so puts a limit upon admissible hypotheses.”Peirce maintained that the search for principles of abduction leads us to the study of innate ideas, which provide the instinctive structure of human intelligence."
8935,这里再次显示出，似乎有一种能够解释许多这种事实的普遍原理。,"It seems, once again, that there is a general principle that accounts for many such facts."
8935,值得注意的是，在43a中的斜体名词短语包含在另一个名词短语中，即：“for him to understand this lecture”，这也是句子的主语。,"Notice that in 43a the italicized noun phrase is contained within another noun phrase, namely “for him to understand this lecture,” which is the subject of the sentence."
8935,然而，在43b中，“外置”规则把短语 “for him to understand this lecture”放到了主语名词短语之外。这样以来，在最终形成的结构中，这个短语根本就不是名词短语。所以，43b中的那个斜体短语就不再包含在名词短语中了。,"In 43b, however, a rule of extraposition has placed the phrase “for him to understand this lecture” outside of the subject noun phrase, and in the resulting structure this phrase is not a noun phrase at all, so that the italicized phrase in 43b is no longer contained within a noun phrase."
8936,我们之所以为人，就在于我们有身体，比较特别的是我们有神经系统。更为特别的，是它的比较高级或比较核心的相互协调的那些部分，精神乃是一个冲动系统，这种观点不应称为唯物主义的。,"The view that we are our bodies, more especially our nervous systems, more especially still the higher or more central coordinating parts of it, and that the mind is a system of impulsesshould not be described as Materialism."
8936,人们同样不妨称之为唯心主义的在这一方面，两个术语都没有任何科学的、任何严格的象征意义或所指意义。,"It might equally well be called Idealism.Neither term in this connection has any scientific, any strictly symbolic meaning or reference."
8937,他继而论述了理应属于判断力领域的美学。三种能力的中间一种；在《纯悴理性批判》和《实践理性批判》里他已经分别就第一和第三种能力作了全面阐述结果他实际是把美学附辑于唯心主义。,"And he went on to discuss aesthetics as appertaining to the province of judgement, the middle one of these three, the first and last having already occupied him in his two other Critiques of Pure and Practical Reason respectively."
8937,从此美学在这个构架中一直起着重人的作用。,"The effect was virtually to annex aesthetics to Idealism, in which fabric it has ever since continued to serve important purposes."
8938,维克多·什克洛夫斯基（Viktor Shklovsky）、尤里·蒂尼亚诺夫（Yury Tynyanov）和鲍里斯·艾亨鲍姆（Boris Eikhenbaum）是诗歌研究会的杰出代表。,"Viktor Shklovsky, Yury Tynyanov and Boris Eikhenbaum were prominent in Opojaz."
8938,形式主义最初的激发力来自未来主义者。第一次世界大战前，未来主义者在艺术领域的努力主要是攻击“颓废的”中产阶级文化，特别是反对诗歌和视觉艺术中痛苦地进行灵魂剖析的象征主义运动。,"The initial impetus was provided by the Futurists, whose artistic efforts before the First World War were directed against ‘decadent’ bourgeois culture and especially against the anguished soul-searching of the Symbolist movement in poetry and the visual arts."
8939,这种差别也见于蜜蜂的信递系统。,This distinction is also true of the system of communication used by honeybees.
8939,搜寻食物的工蜂能够回到蜂巢，与它的同伴沟通，告诉它们食物源的位置。,A forager bee is able to return to the hive and communicate to other bees where a source of food is located.
8939,它在蜂巢的立面上跳舞，以这种方式报告食物的位置和质量。,It does so by performing a dance on a wall of the hive that reveals the location and quality of the food source.
8940,第二个测试就是“用代词替代”。,The second test is “replacement by a pronoun.”
8940,代词可以取代自然的词语组合。,Pronouns can substitute for natural groups.
8940,在回答问题“Where did you find a puppy ( 你在哪里找到了一条小狗）？”时，可以说“I found Mm in the park ( 我在公园找到他的）。,"In answer to the question “Where did you find a puppy?” a speaker can say, “I found him in the park.”"
8940,"”像do 这样的词同样可以取代整个谓语found a puppy ,诸如John found a puppy and B ill血f too (约翰找到了一条小狗，比尔也是）。","Words such as do can also take the place of the entire predicate found a puppy, as in “John found a puppy and Bill did too.”"
8940,如果一组词可以由一个代词或者像do这样的词替代，那么这组词就组成了一个成分。,"If a group of words can be replaced by a pronoun or a word like do, it forms a constituent."
8941,对符号学家来说，大多数文学作品，在发布有关它们自身的信息时，还不断地提示其他文学作品。,"To the semiotician, most works of literature, in emitting messages that refer to themselves, also make constant reference to other works ofliterature."
8941,正如米利·克里斯特瓦指出的，任何“文本”都不能完全“脱离”其他文本。,"As Julia Kristeva has pointed out, no ‘text’ can ever be completely ‘free’ of other texts."
8941,它将卷入她所谓的所有作品的“文本间性”。,It will be involved in what she has termed the intertextuality of all writing.
8942,因此，从原则上说，文学研究和文化研究之间不必一定存在什么矛盾。,"In principle, then, there need not be conflict between literary and cultural studies."
8942,文学研究不会对文化研究批驳的文学对象做出承诺。,Literary studies are not committed to a conception of the literary object that cultural studies must repudiate.
8942,文化研究就是把文学分析的技巧运用到其他文化材料中才得以发展的。,Cultural studies arose as the application of techniques of literary analysis to other cultural materials.
8942,它把文化的手工艺品作为“文本”解读，而不是仅仅把它们作为需要清点的物件。,It treats cultural artefacts as ‘texts’ to be read rather than as objects that are simply there to be counted.
8942,反过来说，如果把文学作为某种文化实践加以研究，把文学作品与其他论述联系起来.文学研究也会有所收获。,"And, conversely, literary studies may gain when literature is studied as a particular cultural practice and works are related to other discourses."
8942,理论的作用一直就在于扩大文学作品可以解答的问题范畴，并且把注意力集中在这些作品用了哪些不同方式来抵制那个时代的思想，或者使其变得复杂化。,The impact of theory has been to expand the range of questions to which literary works can answer and to focus attention on the different ways they resist or complicate the ideas of their age.
8942,从根本上说，文化研究因为坚持把文学研究作为一项具有象征意义的研究实践，坚持探究文化作用如何影响并覆盖文学作品，所以它能够把文学研究作为一种复杂的、相互关联的文本现象加以强化。,"In principle, cultural studies, with its insistence on studying literature as one signifying practice among others, and on examining the culture roles with which literature has been invested, can intensify the study of literature as a complex intertextual phenomenon."
8943,1725年，意大利著名法学家詹巴蒂斯塔•维柯出版了一本叫《新科学》的书。,In 1725 the distinguished Italian jurist Giambattista Vico published a book called The New Science.
8943,这件事在当时几乎未被人们注意，但是这是一个重大的事件。,"It was a momentous occasion, although it passed virtually unnoticed at the time."
8943,因为维柯提出的“科学”正是关于人类社会的科学。,For the ‘science’ Vico proposed was nothing less than a science of human society.
8943,它的典范就是伽利略、培根和牛顿等人的“自然”科学，它的目的旨在向“诸民族的世界”展现这些文艺复兴时期的科学家为探究“自然世界”所获得的成就。,"Its model was the ‘natural’ science of such men as Galileo, Bacon and Newton, and its aim was to perform for ‘the world of nations’ what these Renaissance scientists had achieved for ‘the world of nature’."
8943,简单说來，它的目的是构造“人的物理学”。,"Its goal, in short, was the construction of a ‘physics of man’."
8944,事实上，有许多严重智障的人有很流畅的语言文法能力，例如精神分裂症、阿兹海默症以及一些自闭症的孩子和一些失语症的人。,"Fluent grammatical language can in fact appear in many kinds of people with severe intellectual impairments, like schizophrenics, Alzheimer's patients, some autistic children, and some aphasics."
8944,最近有一个新的症候群被发现出来，就是圣地亚哥一个有话匣子症候群的智障女孩。她的父母在杂志上读到了有关乔姆斯基理论的文章，就打电话到MIT给乔姆斯基，说他应该来看一下他们的女儿，他一定会有兴趣的。,"One of the most fascinating syndromes recently came to light when the parents of a retarded girl with chatterbox syndrome in San Diego read an article about Chomsky's theories in a popular science magazine and called him at MIT, suggesting that their daughter might be of interest to him."
8945,韦尼克区受损的病人很难说出呈现在他们面前的物体的名称，在自然口语中还有选词困难。,People with damage to Wernicke's area have difficulty naming objects presented to them and also in choosing words in spontaneous speech.
8945,他们可能犯许多词汇错误(词汇替代)，常常说出一些杂乱语和无意义词，如下例所示:The only thing that I can say again is madder or modder fish sudden fishing sewed into the accident to miss in the purdles.(我能再次说的唯一的事情是茜草鱼或modder鱼，突然捕鱼被缝入了这起会在purdles中错过的事故。),"They may make numerous lexical errors (word substitutions), often producing jargon and nonsense words, as in the following example:The only thing that I can say again is madder or modder fish sudden fishing sewed into the accident to miss in the purdles."
8946,亚里士多德在《诗学》第6节中给情节下过定义，说“情节”（mythos)是对“事件的安排”。,"In section 6 of the Poetics, Aristotle defines ‘plot’ (‘mythos’) as the ‘arrangement of the incidents’."
8946,“情节”显然与故事不同，故事是情节赖以存在的基础；情节是对构成故事的一系列事件的艺术处理。,A ‘plot’ is clearly distinguished from a story upon which a plot may be based.A plot is the artful disposition of the incidents which make up a story.
8946,希腊悲剧往往以“闪回”开篇，即扼要重复故事中那些被选择作为情节处理的事件之前出现的事件。,"A Greek tragedy usually starts with a ‘flashback’, a recapitulation of the incidents of the story which occurred prior to those which were selected for the plot."
8947,对语言事实的注意，揭示出了句子的某些与语音、语义、变体等都有关系的性质。,"Attention to linguistic fact reveals certain properties of sentences, relating to their sound, their meaning, their deviance, and so on."
8947,显然，只要我们把自己局限在有关“习惯”、“技巧”、“反应倾向”以及“通过类推”形成句子等含糊的谈论中，我们就永远也不能解释这些事实。,"Evidently no explanation for these facts will be forthcoming so long as we restrict ourselves to vague talk about “habits” and “skills” and “dispositions to respond,” or about the formation of sentences “by analogy.”"
8947,我们并没有这样的“习惯”—以某种方式来理解句4、句9和句13：读者很难遇到和它们十分类似的句子，但却能理解它们具体的意思。,"We do not have the “habit” of understanding sentences 4, 9, and 13 in a certain way: it is unlikely that the reader has ever encountered sentences closely resembling these, but he understands them in a highly specific way nevertheless."
8948,历史上许多关于体裁的理论家一直遵循希腊式分类，把作品根据由谁叙述大至分为三类：诗歌或抒情诗，叙述人为第一人称；史诗或叙事，叙述人以自己的声音出现，但也允许其他角色以自己的声音叙述；还有戏剧，全部对话由角色进行。还有一种分类方法注重叙述人与观众的关系。,"Historically, many theorists of genre have followed the Greeks, who divided works among three broad classes according to who speaks: poetic or lyric, where the narrator speaks in the first person, epic or narrative, where the narrator speaks in his own voice but allows characters to speak in theirs, and drama, where the characters do all the talking.Another way of making this distinction is to focus on the relation of speaker to audience."
8948,史诗中有口头吟诵：诗人直接面对听众。,"In epic, there is oral recitation: a poet directly confronting the listening audience."
8948,在戏剧中，剧作家看不到观众，而是由舞台上的角色去叙述。,"In drama, the author is concealed from the audience and the characters on stage talk."
8948,"抒情诗的情况最复杂，诗人或唱或吟诵，可以说是背对听众的，“做出自言自语或对其他什么人讲话的样子：也许是对大自然中的一个精灵, 对缪斯，对一位朋友，对一个情人、一个神灵、一个人格化了的抽象事物，或是某个自然的对象”。","In lyric–the most complicated case–the poet, in singing or chanting, turns his back on his listeners, so to speak, and ‘pretends to be talking to himself or to someone else: a spirit of Nature, a Muse, a personal friend, a lover, a god, a personified abstraction, or a natural object’."
8948,我们还可以把小说这个现代体裁加到这三个基本体裁当中去。小说通过一部书与读者交谈—我们将在第六章专门论述这个题目。,"To these three elementary genres we can add the modern genre of the novel, which addresses the reader through a book–a topic we’ll take up in Chapter 6."
8949,说英语的人都知道red(红）、white(白）和blue(蓝）都是颜色词。,"Speakers of English know that the words red, white, and blue are color words."
8949,与此类似，lion(狮子）、tiger(老虎）、leopard(豹子）和lynx(猞猁）都是猫科动物。,"Similarly, lion, tiger, leopard, and lynx are all felines."
8949,这样成组的词称为“下义词”。,Such sets of words are called hyponyms.
8950,"第二语言习得, 或二语习得, 一般指已习得第一语言的人 (成人或儿童) 获得第二语言。","The term second language acquisition, or L2 acquisition, generally refers to the acquisition of a second language by someone (adult or child) who has already acquired a first language."
8950,这也称为先后双语。,This is also referred to as sequential bilingualism.
8950,"双语习得指的是 (或多或少地) 同时习得两种语言, 从幼年开始 (或在三岁之前), 也称为同时双语。","Bilingual language acquisition refers to the (more or less) simultaneous acquisition of two languages beginning in infancy (or before the age of three years), also referred to as simultaneous bilingualism."
8951,代词有不同的类型。,There are different types of pronouns.
8951,反身代词是指himself(他自己)和themselves(他们自己)这样的代词。,Reflexive pronouns are pronouns such as himself and themselves.
8951,在英语中，反身代词总是通过回指同一个小句中的NP先行语而获得语义，如下例所示(下画线表示反身代词冋指NP)：,"In English, reflexive pronouns always depend on an NP antecedent for their meaning and the antecedent must be in the same clause, as illustrated in the following examples:"
8952,迄今为止左右人类历史的一直是劳动的需要；对于弗洛伊德来说，这一严酷的需要意味着我们必须压抑一部分追求快乐和满足的趋向。,What has dominated human history to date is the need to labour; and for Freud that harsh necessity means that we must repress some of our tendencies to pleasure and gratification.
8952,如果我们不是为了生存而必须工作，我们也许终日倦眠而无所事事。,"If we were not called upon to work in order to survive, we might simply lie around all day doing nothing."
8952,每个人都得经受弗洛伊德所谓的“现实原则”对“快乐原则”的压抑，但是某些人甚至整个社会都可能会由于压抑过度而致病。,"Every human being has to undergo this repression of what Freud named the 'pleasure principle' by the 'reality principle', but for some of us, and arguably for whole societies, the repression may become excessive and make us ill."
8953,"对文学专业的学生来说，列维-斯特劳斯的“结构""人类学和由此产生的结构语言学的含义必然是深刻的。","For the student of literature, the implications of Lévi-Strauss’s sort of ‘structural’ anthropology and the structural linguistics from which it derives, must be considerable."
8953,"首先，这两门学科的基本概念都为现代人攻击“现实主义”或“自然主义”提供了基础，并因而给予了动力。“现实主义""或“自然主义”的前提是，一件语言艺术作品和它必定要“涉及”的“现实”或“自然”之间存在着明显的一对一的对应。","Primarily, the notions fundamental to both disciplines provide a basis for, and so lend power to, the modern attack on ‘realism’ or ‘naturalism’: the presupposition that a transparent ‘one-to-one’ correspondence exists between a work of art in language, and the ‘reality’ or ‘nature’ to which that work of art is presupposed to ‘refer’."
8954,举一个例子：从广义来讲换喻包含了一个序列或者一个语境中一个成分向另一个成分的转换：我们说一个杯子（cup)，意思是指杯中装的东西（contents）；用赛马场（turf）指赛马（racing）；用一个舰队的数百条帆（sails）指船（ships）。,"An example: in its broad sense, metonymy involves the shift from one element in a sequence to another, or one element in a context to another: we refer to a cup of something (meaning its contents); the turf (for racing), a ﬂeet of a hundred sails (for ships)."
8954,从根本上讲，换喻的运用要求有一个语境，因此，雅各布森把现实主义与换喻联系了起来。,Essentially metonymy requires a context for its operation; hence Jakobson’s linking of realism with metonymy.
8954,现实主义在讲客体的时候，往往要向读者描述其特征、局部和语境的细节，以便营造一个整体的氛围。,"Realism speaks of its object by offering the reader aspects, parts, and contextual details, in order to evoke a whole."
8955,每种没有“内在”为意识的东西都要严格排除。一切现实事物都必须按其呈现于我们心中的面貌而作为纯粹的“现象”来对待，这是我们可以由之开始的唯一确凿材料。,"Everything not 'immanent' to consciousness must be rigorously excluded; all realities must be treated as pure 'phenomena', in terms of their appearances in our mind, and this is the only absolute data from which we can begin."
8955,胡塞尔为他的哲学方法赋予“现象学”的名称，即是源于对这一点的坚守。,The name Husserl gave to his philosophical method --phenomenology —stems from this insistence.
8955,现象学就是关于纯粹现象的科学。,Phenomenology is a science of pure phenomena.
8956,格莱麦声称他的程序如下：他以生与死的对立作为基本语义层，然后从全部文本中把这一语义层上的所有限定性修饰语提取出来。,Greimas claims that his procedure is as follows: he chooses as his basic isotopy the opposition between life and death and extracts from the corpus all the qualiﬁcations situated on this isotopy.
8956,把修饰生的语言单元分出，简化为若干组语义素，然后再作一次提取，将出现这些语义素的所有的语境罗列出来。,"Taking the items which qualify life, one reduces them to a limited set of sememes and then, by a second process of extraction, collects all the contexts in which each of these appears."
8956,他所进行的是一种最传统的格局分布分析。,He is thus undertaking a distributional analysis of the most traditional kind.
8957,自从此文发表以来，意图在批评中的位置问题引发了许多争论，今天，这种争论仍在继续：卫姆塞特与比尔兹利的立场引起了一些批评流派的共鸣，例如，后结构主义提出了“作者死亡”的观点（见后文）；解构主义提出了将文本从“永在”与“意义”中解放出来的观点。,"Much critical debate has since raged about the place of intention in criticism, and continues to do so: Wimsatt and Beardsley’s position strikes a chord, for example, with poststructuralist notions of the ‘death of the author’ (see below, pp. 149–50) and with deconstruction’s freeing of the text from ‘presence’ and ‘meaning’."
8957,但是他们之间的共同点到这儿就停止了，因为，新批评从根本上仍然坚持认为，存在着一个确定的、就本体论来看稳定的“诗本体”，这个诗本体正是它自己的“陈述”的最终仲裁者，因此，一种“客观的”批评是可能进行的。,"But there the resemblance ends, for the New Critics still basically insist that there is a determinate, ontologically stable ‘poem itself’, which is the ultimate arbiter of its own ‘statement’, and that an ‘objective’ criticism is possible."
8957,这一观念与解构主义的那种文本可以被多处“移置”，反复不断读解的无限性观念是背道而驰的。,
8957,,This runs quite counter to deconstruction’s notion of the ‘iterability’ of a text in its multiplex ‘positioned’ rereadings.
8958,有时，习得手语和习得口语之间的相似性令人吃惊。,Sometimes the parallels between the acquisition of signed and spoken languages are striking.
8958,ASL中的一些语法语素是语义透明或象似的，就是说，它们的样子就是所表达的意义。例如，表示代词“我”的手势就是说话人指着自己的胸部。,"For example, some of the grammatical morphemes in ASL are semantically transparent or iconic, that is, they look like what they mean; for example, the sign for the pronoun “I” involves the speaker pointing to his chest."
8959,在18世纪初，半带神秘色彩的象征学说是美学理论的中心。,At the centre of aesthetic theory at the turn of the eighteenth century is the semi-mystical doctrine of the symbol.
8959,对于浪漫主义，象征确实成为解决一切问题的万应灵药。,"For Romanticism, indeed, the symbol becomes the panacea for all problems."
8959,在象征之内，日常生活中无法解决的一系列矛盾冲突——主体与客体，普遍与特殊，感觉与概念，物质与精神，秩序与自发——都可以奇迹般地得到解决。,"Within it, a whole set of conflicts which were felt to be insoluble in ordinary life — between subject and object, the universal and the particular, the sensuous and the conceptual, material and spiritual, order and spontaneity — could be magically resolved."
8960,在威廉·卡洛斯·威廉斯的诗歌中，我们看到几乎相反的过程。,"In William Carlos Williams’s poem, we see the process almost in reverse."
8960,在这首诗中，“这段书写构成诗歌”亦即“这些词的意义超出它们表面的意思”这一视觉图像信息，把一种新的令人激奋的情境强加于本来会是平平庸庸的一篇写作。同时，那种散发出来的象征符号缺乏我们的文化引导我们去寻找或期望的“诗歌性质”的任何标志。,"Here the imposition of a new and disturbing status on what would otherwise remain a banal domestic piece of writing is brought about by the visual iconic message which says ‘this passage of writing constitutes a poem’: that is, ‘these words have a significance beyond their overt meaning.’ Meanwhile, the symbolic signs emitted lack any of the indications of ‘poemness’ that our culture leads us to look for andexpect."
8961,受弗洛伊德影响的两位美国批评家是肯尼斯·伯克(Kenneth Burke)和哈罗德·布鲁姆(Harold Bloom)，他们截然不同。前者调和弗洛伊德、马克思和语言学以创造他自己的有启发性的观点：文学作品是一种象征行为。后者利用弗洛伊德的著作创立了70年代最大胆最有创见的文学理论之一。,"Two very different American critics indebted to Freud are Kenneth Burke, who eclectically blends Freud, Marx and linguistics to produce his own suggestive view of the literary work as a form of symbolic action, and Harold Bloom, who has used the work of Freud to launch one of the most daringly original literary theories of the past decade."
8962,以菲勒斯为象征的父亲的存在，教给孩子他必须在家庭中占据一个地位，这个地位由性别差异、排除（他不能作母亲或父亲的情人）和缺失（他必须中止他早期与母亲肉体的联系）所限定。,"The presence of the father, symbolized by the phallus, teaches the child that it must take up a place in the family which is denned by sexual difference, by exclusion (it cannot be its parent's lover) and by absence (it must relinquish its earlier bonds to the mother's body)."
8962,他渐渐感到，他作为主体的身份，是由他与他周围主体的区别和相似关系所构成的。,"Its identity as a subject, it comes to perceive, is constituted by its relations of difference and similarity to the other subjects around it."
8962,随着所有这一切的接受，儿童从想象的领域转向拉康所谓的“象征秩序”：即构成家庭和社会的、事先规定的社会的和性的作用与关系的结构。,"In accepting all of this, the child moves from the imaginary register into what Lacan calls the 'symbolic order': the pre-given structure of social and sexual roles and relations which make up the family and society."
8962,用弗洛伊德自己的话来说，儿童已经成功地通过了俄狄浦斯情结的痛苦道路。,
8963,文学是一种作者力图提高或更新文学的实践，因此它水远会暗含对文学本身的折射。,Literature is a practice in which authors attempt to advance or renew literature and thus is always implicitly a reflection on literature itself.
8963,不过，我们再次发现这一点同样适用于其他形式。例如，小招贴广告同诗篇一样，它要表达的意思可以是建立在先前这类小招贴广告的基础之上。假如没有“禁止核武器!”“救救鲸鱼!,"But once again, we find that this is something we could say about other forms: bumper stickers, like poems, may depend for their meaning on prior bumper stickers: ‘Nuke a Whale for Jesus!’ makes no sense without‘No Nukes,’ ‘Save the Whales,’ and ‘Jesus Saves,’ and one could certainly say that ‘Nuke a Whale for Jesus’ is really about bumper stickers."
8963,”和“耶稣拯救万物!,
8963,”等小招贴广告，“为了耶稣，不要用核武器屠杀鲸鱼！,
8963,”就没有任何意义。,
8963,所以，我们可以肯定地说“为了耶稣，不要用核武器屠杀鲸鱼!,
8963,"”是关于小招贴广吿的小招贴广吿。最后, 文学的交织性和它的自我折射性并非其本质特征，而是突出语言运用的某些方面和语言再现的某些问題，在其他地方可能也会观察到同样的现象。","The intertextuality and self-reflexivity of literature is not, finally, a defining feature but a foregrounding of aspects of language use and questions about representation that may also be observed elsewhere."
8964,人们用一种楔形的尖笔在黏土做成的泥版上刻写这些符号，这些泥板受沙漠中的烈日炙烤而硬化，成为永久性的记录，远比现代纸张和电子文档更具持久性。,They began to produce the symbols of their written language by using a wedge-shaped stylus that was pressed into soft clay tablets.The tablets hardened in the desert sun to produce permanent records that were far hardier than modern paper or electronic documents.
8964,如果原版的美国独立宣言是用这种方式写成，今天就不再需 要修复和保护。,"Had the original American Declaration of Independence been written this way, it would not be in need of restoration and preservation."
8964,这一形式的文字就叫作楔形文字—字面意思就是“楔形的”（该词源自拉丁语cuneus“楔”）。,"This form of writing is called cuneiform—literally, “wedge- shaped” (from Latin cuneus, “wedge”)."
8965,的确，在所谓scrambling的语言里，格的标记用得更广：冠词、形容词、名词每一个都加上一个格的标记，这样说话的人可以把短语中的字随便散在句子中都没关系(好比说把形容词放在最后以加重语气)，听话的人自己在心中把这些字位置还原。这种在文法上叫做对呼应或谐和。,"Indeed, in what are called ''scrambling'' languages, case markers are exploited even further: the article, adjective, and noun inside a phrase are each tagged with a particular case marker, and the speaker can scramble the words of the phrase all over the sentence (say, put the adjective at the end for emphasis), knowing that the listener can mentally join them back up."
8965,这是把连续出现、交错纠缠不清的字意义厘清的第二个解决方法。,"This process, called agreement or concord, is a second engineering solution (aside from phrase structure itself to the problem of encoding a tangle of interconnected thoughts into strings of words that appear one after the other."
8966,第一种类型的文本只允许读者成为一种固定意义的消费者；而第二种类型的文本把读者变成生产者。,"The first type of text allows the reader only to be a consumer of a fixed meaning, while the second turns the reader into a producer."
8966,"第一种类型的文本称为“阅读文本”(readerly, lisible）；第二种称为“写作文本”（writerly, scriptible）。","The first type of text is called ‘readerly’ (lisible), the second ‘writerly’ (scriptible)."
8966,第一种文本的目的是供阅读（消费）；第二种文本是供写作（生产）。,"The first is made to be read (consumed), the second to be written (produced)."
8967,那个阅读的“我”早己是一个“关涉了其他文本的多数”，先锋派文本允许将已经阅读的与这个多数联系起来，从而获得生产种种意义的最大自由。,The ‘I’ which reads is ‘already itself a plurality of other texts’ and is allowed by the avant-garde text the maximum liberty to produce meanings by putting what is read in touch with this plurality.
8967,第一种类型的文本只允许读者成为一种固定意义的消费者；而第二种类型的文本把读者变成生产者。,"The ﬁrst type of text allows the reader only to be a consumer of a ﬁxed meaning, while the second turns the reader into a producer."
8967,"第一种类型的文本称为“阅读文本”(readerly, lisible）；第二种称为“写作文本（writerly，scriptible）。","The ﬁrst type of text is called ‘readerly’ (lisible), the second ‘writerly’ (scriptible)."
8967,第一种文本的目的是供阅读（消费）；第二种文本是供写作（生产）。,"The ﬁrst is made to be read (consumed), the second to be written (produced)."
8968,法国女性主义深受心理分析的影响，特别是拉康对 弗洛伊德的重新阐释的影响(见第7章)，这样就消 减了迄今为止许多法国女性主义对弗洛伊德的敌视。,"French feminism has been deeply influenced by psychoanalysis, especially by Jacques Lacan’s reworking of Freud (see Chapter 7), and in this has overcome the hostility towards the latter hitherto shared by many feminists."
8968,在拉康之前，弗洛伊德的理论特别在美国(参看前文对米利特的论述) 一直被缩减到一种粗糙的生理层面上；女性幼儿看到了男性器官，意识到自己是女性，因为她没有阴茎。,"Before Lacan, Freud’s theories, especially in the United States (cf. Kate Millett above), had been reduced to a crude biological level: the female child, seeing the male organ, recognizes herself as female because she lacks the penis."
8968,她蔑视贬低自己，明显地感到一种“ 阴茎忌妒”的痛苦。,She defines herself negatively and suffers an inevitable ‘penis envy’.
8969,在这一点上，研究阅读的心理学家和语言学家达成的共识是，阅读教学必须立足于对字母和语音之间联系的切实了解，而让孩子觉得阅读有趣并且有意义的全语认读活动应作为字母认读法教学的辅助。这一共识也得到很多老师的认可。,"At this point, the consensus among psychologists and linguists who do research on reading—and a view shared by many teachers—is that reading instruction must be grounded in a firm understanding of the connections between letters and sounds, and that whole-language activities that make reading fun and meaningful for children should be used to supplement phonics instruction."
8969,从这样的研究出发，目前联邦政府在美国各地推广包含字母认读法在内的阅读课程。,"Based on such research, the federal government now promotes the inclusion of phonics in reading programs across the United States."
8970,也就是说，在每一领域中都已表明——在我看来还是很有说服力的，这神方法不仅是不够的，而且从根本上就是错误的。,"That is, in each case ithas been argued – quite persuasively, in my opinion – that the approach is not only inadequate but misguided in basic and important ways."
8970,我以为，事情已很清楚了：如果我们还想理解语言的运用和获得，我们就必须抽取出一个认知系统——一个知识和信念的系统——加以独立地研究。该系统形成于儿童早期，并与许多其它因素相互作用，从而确定我们所观察到的各种行为。如果引用一个专业术语，那就是，我们必须把隐藏在行为底层但却并不以任何直接的或简单的方式表现在行为中的“语言能力”系统分离出来，加以研究。,"It has, I believe, become quite clear that if we are ever to understand how language is used or acquired, then we must abstract for separate and independent study a cognitive system, a system of knowledge and belief, that develops in early childhood and that interacts with many other factors to determine the kinds of behavior that we observe; to introduce a technical term, we must isolate and study the system of linguistic competence that underlies behavior but that is not realized in any direct or simple way in behavior."
8971,只不过几年以后，人们惊喜地发现，机器翻译和自动摘要也为期不远了。,"And just a few years later, it was jubilantly discovered that machine translation and automatic abstracting were also just around the corner."
8971,对于那些寻求用更多的数学公式来表示基本过程的人来说，在50年代前期形成的关于通讯的数学理论提供了一个基本概念一一信息。信息概念能把社会科学和行为科学结合起来，并在概率的基础上，为人的行为提供一个可靠的、令人满意的数学理论，大约与此同时，作为一种独立的研究结果的 自动机理论也发展起来了，使用的也是与信息论密切相关的数学概念。,"For those who sought a more mathematical formulation of the basic processes, there was the newly developed mathematical theory of communication, which, it was widely believed in the early 1950s, had provided a fundamental concept – the concept of “information” – that would unify the social and behavioral sciences and permit the development of a solid and satisfactory mathematical theory of human behavior on a probabilistic base.At about the same time, the theory of automata developed as an independent study, making use of closely related mathematical notions."
8972,许多人都利用因特网的搜寻功能来查找信息。,Many people use the search features of the Internet to find information.
8972,典型的做法是，人们输入一个关键词，或许几个关键词，然后不可思议地看见，计算机反馈回来一些网址，其中都包含与那个关键词相关的信息。,"Typically, one enters a keyword, or perhaps several, and magically the computer returns the location of Web sites that contain information relating to that keyword."
8972,这个过程就是信息提取的一个例子。,This process is an example of information retrieval.
8973,俚语和行话方面的词典（见第十章）由来已久，多语种词典也是如此。,Dictionaries of slang and jargon (see chapter 10) have existed for many years; so have multilingual dictionaries.
8973,除此以外，如今书店和图书馆的书架上堆满了各种专门为各界人士编写的词典，如生物学家、工程师、农学家、经济学家，艺术家、建筑师 、印刷工人、男女同性恋者、异装癖者、运动员、网球手，等等——只要拥有自己的一套词汇来表达其所思所为，几乎任何群体都在此列。,"In addition to these, the shelves of bookstores and libraries are now filled with dictionaries written specifically for biologists, engineers, agriculturists, economists, artists, architects, printers, gays and lesbians, transsexuals, runners, tennis players, and almost any group that has its own set of words to describe what they think and what they do."
8973,我们自己的心理词典大约只包括所有这呰词典的条目中数量较小的一部分。但是，每个词都可以在某人的词库当中找到。,"Our own mental dictionaries include only a small set of the entries in all of these dictionaries, but each word is in someone’s lexicon."
8974,考虑到结构语言学强烈的反心理主义立场，这样来评价它似乎有点自相矛盾。,"It may seem a bit paradoxical to speak of structural linguistics in this way, given its militant anti-psychologism."
8974,但是如果我们注意到，当代心理学本身—尤其是那些直到几年前还垄断着语言习得和语言运用研究的心理学分支—同样具有这种激烈的反心理主义立场，上述评论就不矛盾了。,"But the paradox is lessened when we take note of the fact that this militant anti-psychologism is no less true of much of contemporary psychology itself, particularly of those branches that until a few years ago monopolized the study of use and acquisition of language."
8974,毕竟，我们生活在一个“行为科学”的时代，而非“心理科学”的时代。,"We live, after all,in the age of “behavioral science,” not of “the science of mind.”"
8974,我不想在此过多地在术语革新上作文章，但我想，近代人在对人和社会的思考中，心甘情愿采取“行为科学”这一标记，是有某种意义的。,"I do not want to read too much into a terminological innovation, but I think that there is some significance in the ease and willingness with which modern thinking about man and society accepts the designation “behavioral science.”"
8975,根据J·L·奥斯丁的定义，行为性言语应该是陈述本身履行了所指示的行为：例如在“我保证付给你十镑”这句话中，保证行为就是说话行为本身。,"Performative utterances, as Austin defined them, are statements which themselves accomplish the acts to which they refer: thus in ‘I promise to pay you ten pounds’ the act of promising is the uttering of the sentence."
8975,谎言并非这一意义上的行为性言语；它们恰好只是虚假的陈述。,Lies are not performative in this sense; they are statements which happen to be false.
8975,它们虽然在文本中具有特殊的作用，然而，作为语言学的论点却给弄混淆了。,"And though they may well play a privileged role in the text, the linguistic argument is pure obfuscation."
8976,在20世纪50年代，行为主义支配了现代社会科学，当时所盛行的是华生和史金纳的理论。,"In the 1950s the social sciences were dominated by behaviorism, the school of thought popularized by John Watson and B. F. Skinner."
8976,他们认为有关心智的活动，例如 “知道”和“思考”是“不科学的”，而心智和天赋则是脏话。,"Mental terms like ''know"", and ''think'' were branded as unscientific; ''mind"" and ''innate"", were dirty words."
8976,他们认为:行为可以藉由研究老鼠按杆，或狗见讯号就流口水所得来的几个简单的刺激-反应定律，就可以解释。,Behavior was explained by a few laws of stimulus-response learning that could be studied with rats pressing bars and dogs salivating to tones.
8977,形式主义者出现于1917年布尔什维克革命之前的俄国。他们在整个20年代都很活跃，直到斯大林主义有效地使其沉默。,"The Formalists emerged in Russia in the years before the 1917 Bolshevik revolution, and flourished throughout the 1920s, until they were effectively silenced by Stalinism."
8977,作为一个富有战斗和论争精神的批评团休，他们拒绝此前曾经影响着文学批评的神秘的象征主义理论原则，并且以实践的科学精神把注意转向文学作品本身的物质实在。,"A militant, polemical group of critics, they rejected the quasi-mystical symbolist doctrines which had influenced literary criticism before them, and in a practical, scientific spirit shifted attention to the material reality of the literary text itself."
8978,让我们来玩“ 折磨计算机”的游戏。,Let’s play “torment the computer.”
8978,设想有一个相当好的形态分析器。,Imagine a fairly good morphological parser.
8978,"输入kindness,它会分析成kind + ness，输入upchuck，它就会分析成up + chuck，但是，如果你输入catsup，而它却分析成cat+s+up，你便会责备它。","Give it kindness, it returns kind + ness; give it upchuck, it returns up + chuck, but if you give it catsup and it returns cat + s + up, you will scold it."
8978,请再想出10个这样可能诱导计算机做出错误分析的词。,Think of ten more words that are likely to lead to false analyses.
8979,后缀-ify 与名词结合也能构成动词： objectify ( 使客观化）， glorify ( 赞美），personify (拟人化）。,"The suffix -ify conjoined with nouns also forms verbs: objectify, glorify, personify."
8979,"请注意“滑稽龟” 走得更远，他将后缀-cation加于u g lify之上又构成名词uglification, 就像glorification, simplification, falsification, purification 一样。","Notice that the Mock Turtle went even further; he added the suffix -cation to uglify and formed a noun, uglification, as in glorification, simplification, falsification, and purification."
8979,通过使用英语的形态规则，他创造了一个新词。,"By using the morphological rules of English, he created a new word."
8980,决定复数语素或是其余语素的语音实现的专有规则叫作形态音位规则。,The particular phonological rules that determine the phonetic form of the plural morpheme and other morphemes of the language are morphophonemic rules.
8980,这些规则与特定语素的发音相关。,Such rules concern the pronunciation of specific morphemes.
8980,因此，复数形态音位的规则仅作用于复数语素而非英语中所有语素。,"Thus the plural morphophonemic rules apply to the plural morpheme specifically, not to all morphemes in English."
8981,考虑到这些，一些学者认为英语使用的是一种形态音位正字法，而不仅仅是音位拼写法。,"These considerations have led some scholars to suggest that in addition to being phonemic, English has a morphophonemic orthography."
8981,如果要正确地读英语，形态音位的知识必不可少。,"To read English correctly, morphophonemic knowledge is required."
8981,英语不同于西班牙语那样正字法只体现音位的语言。,"This contrasts with a language such as Spanish, whose orthography is almost purely phonemic."
8982,托多洛夫在题为《如何阅读？》的论文中谈到他称之为“形象化”的功能活动，即把在多层次起作用的某一形象或结构所决定的一部或一组文本，视为一个系统。他援引波利斯·艾亨鲍姆对俄国诗人安娜·阿赫玛托娃的研究的例子：“这首诗作在各个层次上都符合矛盾修饰法的概念……，不仅在文体细节，而且在主题方面都表现出来。”,"In an essay entitled ‘Comment lire?’ Todorov speaks of an operationcalled ‘figuration’, which consists of taking a text or group of texts as a system determined by a particular figure or structure functioning atvarious levels.He cites as example Boris Eichenbaum’s study of the Russian poet, Anna Akhmatova: ‘at all levels this poetic opus obeys the figure of oxymoron . . . it is reflected not only in stylistic details but also in the subject’."
8983,结构主义在很多方面与传统的文学批评决裂，在另外很多方面却依然委身于传统的文学批评。,"Structuralism broke with conventional literary criticism in many ways, while remaining mortgaged to it in many others."
8983,我们已经看到，结构主义对于语言的专注具有革命性的意义，但是对于语言的专注同时也是学究们摆脱不开的旧东西。,"Its preoccupation with language was, as we have seen, radical in its implications, but it was at the same time a familiar obsession of academics."
8983,语言就是一切吗？,Was language really all there was?
8983,关于劳动、性、政治权力又该怎么说呢？,"What about labour, sexuality, political power?"
8983,这些现实本身也许会被话语难以摆脱地抓住，但是它们却肯定不能被还原为话语。,"These realities might themselves be inextricably caught up in discourse, but they were certainly not reducible to it."
8984,第三，女性主义批评家必须重视文学文本的虚构本质，不应沉溺于“激烈的道德主义”中，一味谴责所有男性作家书中的性别歧视（见米利特），赞同所有提出性别问题的女性作家。,"Third, feminist critics must take account of the fictional nature of literary texts and not indulge in ‘rampant moralism’ by condemning all male authors for the sexism of their books (vide Millett) and approving all women authors for raising the issue of gender."
8984,文本并没有固定的意义：解释取决于读者的立场与意识形态。,Texts have no fixed meanings: interpretations depend on the situation and ideology of the reader.
8984,无论如何，女性能够而且应该努力施加自己的影响，以确定性别被界定和从文化上再现的方式。,"Nevertheless, women can and should try to assert their influ- ence upon the way in which gender is defined and represented culturally."
8985,这一发展的征象出现在“性别研究”（Gender Studies）的崛起与“男同性恋研究”（Gay Studies）和新兴的“人的研究”（Men's Studies）的对话中。“人的研究”建立在女性主义与男同性恋理论的基础上，旨在对人的性行为与生活方式加以批评和重建。,"Signs of this development have since appeared in the academic rise of Gender Studies and the dialogues in Gay Studies with the emerging discipline of Men’s Studies, which aims to build on feminism and gay theory so as to provide a critique and reconstruction of men’s sexualities and lifestyles."
8985,对于学术界的这些倾向一些人是心怀忧虑与反对的。在一些领域，男同性恋理论与女性主义仍有争议，甚至有敌对的情形。,"There has been anxiety over and opposition to both these tendencies, and there remains in some quarters an unsettled, even antagonistic, relationship between gay theory and feminism."
8986,在性差异中讨论最多的集中在五个要点上：生物学、体验、话语、无意识和社会经济状况。,Five main foci are involved in most discussions of sexual difference: biology; experience; discourse; the unconscious; and social and economic conditions.
8986,强调生理差异胜过社会化作用主要是男人们的论点，目的是让女人们“安分守己”，古老的拉丁俗语说“女人不过是子宫而己”(Tota mulier in utero)是最早确立这种态度的一个证据。,Arguments which treat biology as fundamental and which play down socialization have been used mainly by men to keep women ‘in their place’.The old Latin saying ‘Tota mulier in utero’ (‘Women is nothing but a womb’) established this attitude early.
8986,假如女人的身体就是她的命运，那么，对给予女性的性角色的所有质疑就会极大地违反自然秩序。,"If a woman’s body is her destiny, then all attempts to question attributed sex-roles will fly in the face of the natural order."
8987,在文学批评中，哈洛德·布鲁姆（Harold Bloom）对修辞手段的运用格外精彩。,In literary criticism Harold Bloom has made spectacular use of tropes.
8987,尽管他也是耶鲁大学的教授，但他却不像德·曼和哈特曼（见下文）那样主张激烈的文本性，他依然把文学看作一个特定的研究领域。,"Despite being a Yale professor, he is less radically ‘textual’ than de Man or Geoffrey Hartman (see below), and still treats literature as a special field of study."
8987,不过，他把修辞格理论、弗洛伊德心理学和希伯来哲学神秘主义结合在一起的做法却显得颇为大胆。,"However, his combination of the theory of tropes, Freudian psychology and cabbalistic mysticism is a daring one."
8988,但是，如果说结构主义改变了诗的研究，那么它也使叙事研究革命化了。,"But if structuralism transformed the study of poetry, it also revolutionized the study of narrative."
8988,"的确，它创造了一门完整的新的文学科学——叙事学。这一方面最有影响的实践者是立陶宛人A·J·格雷马 (A.J.Greimas) ，比利时人 T. 托多洛夫 (Tzvetan Todorov) , 以及法国批评家热拉·若奈特 (Gérard Genette) ，克劳德·布雷门 (Claud e Bremond) 和罗兰·巴尔特 (Roland Barthes)。","Indeed it created a whole new literary science -narratology - of which the most influential practitioners have been the Lithuanian A.J. Greimas, the Bulgarian Tzvetan Todorov, and the French critics Gerard Genette, Claude Bremond and Roland Barthes."
8989,什克洛夫斯基把公认为他在抒情诗方面用得很得力的观念继续应用于小说这个很不相同的结构。,"Shklovsky goes on to apply the same notion, which admitedly works well with the lyric, to the quite diﬀerent structure of the novel."
8989,如果说抒情诗就其对象而言，在某种意义上是“静态的”，其影响是瞬间的，并作为单独的统一体是可以把握的，那么，小说对叙述，对时间中的运动所承担的责任则便小说成为骨子是动态的积极的实体。,"Where the lyric is in a sense ‘static’ in respect of its object, instantaneous in its impact and graspable as a single unity, the novel’s commitment to narrative, to movement in and through time, makes it an essentially dynamic and active entity."
8989,什克洛夫斯基对此的认识和作出的尝试，使他成为最早尝试建立小说“诗学”的前驱之一，我们以后会看到，正是这种举动对后来的结构主义批评产生了巨大的影响。,"Shklovsky’s awareness of this, and his attempts to deal with it, constitute one of the ﬁrst attempts at a ‘poetics’ of ﬁction, and it is one which, as we shall see, has greatly inﬂuenced subsequent structuralist criticism."
8990,叙事学家杰拉德·普林斯（Gerald Prince）提问说，当我们研究小说时，我们为什么要花费那么大的力气区分各类叙述者（全知全能型作者、不可靠作者、隐含的作者等等），而从不问叙述者把话语发送给的那些人有多么不同。,"The narratologist Gerald Prince asks why, when we study novels, do we take such pains to discriminate between the various kinds of narrator (omniscient, unreliable, implied author, etc.), but never ask questions about the different kinds of person to whom the narrator addresses the discourse."
8990,普林斯把这些人叫做“叙述接受者”（narratee）。,Prince calls this person the ‘narratee’.
8990,我们绝不能把叙述接受者与读者混为一谈。,We must not confuse the narratee with the reader.
8991,结构主义叙述理论是从某些根本的语言类比中产生的。,Structuralist narrative theory develops from certain elementary linguistic analogies.
8991,句法（句子结构的法则）是叙事学法则的根本模式。,Syntax (the rules of sentence construction) is the basic model of narrative rules.
8991,托多洛夫等人谈论“叙事句法”（narrative syntax）。,Todorov and others talk of ‘narrative syntax’.
8991,句子中最基本的句法法则是主谓之分：“骑士（主语）用剑屠龙（谓语）”。显而易见，这个句子可以是一个事件片段甚至整个故事的核心。,The most elementary syntactic division of the sentence unit is between subject and predicate: ‘The knight (subject) slew the dragon with his sword (predicate).’ Evidently this sentence could be the core of an episode or even an entire tale.
8992,选择行为代码主宰读者对情节的架构。,The proairetic code governs the reader's construction of plot.
8992,阐释代码包括回答逻辑，谜语与解释，悬念与突变。,"The hermeneutic code involves a logic of question and answer, enigma and solution, suspense and peripeteia."
8992,这些无疑都是小说的组成部分，两者都可以放在情节结构的范畴中考虑。,These are undoubted components of the novel and can both be located in the realm of plot structure.
8993,实际上，勃里蒙混淆了阐释代码的活动与选择行为代码的活动。,"Bremond seems, in fact, to have confused the operations of the hermeneutic code with those of the proairetic code."
8993,后者的成分必须作反时间顺序的界定，而前者的成分则是按顺时间顺序加以识别，犹如对悬念或疑案的期待那样。,"Elements of the latter must be defined retrospectively, whereas those of the former are recognized prospectively, as a prospect of suspense or mystery."
8993,如果我们在此对阐释代码再说上几句，我们再回到情节结构的论题时思想准备就会更加充分了。,If we say a word about the hermeneutic code we shall be better prepared to return to plot structure proper.
8994,它没有与“能力” 相对应的概念——在可以用生成语法来表征能力的意义上而言。,"It has no concept corresponding to “competence,” in the sense in which competence is characterized by a generativegrammar."
8994,学习理论则一直把自己局限在一个狭隘而不当的关于业已习得的东西的概念上——即刺激-反应的联接系统，联想的网络，行为项目的储备库，习惯的等级结构，或在特化的剌激条件下以特殊方式作出反应的倾向系统。,"The theory of learning has limited itself to a narrow and surely inadequate concept of what is learned – namely a system of stimulus-response connections, a network of associations, a repertoire of behavioral items, a habit hierarchy, or a system of dispositions to respond in a particularway under specifiable stimulus conditions.5"
8994,就行为心理学在教育和治疗中的应用而论，它也同样地把自己局限在“所习得的东西”这样一个概念上。,"Insofar as behavioral psychology has been applied to education or therapy, it has correspondingly limited itself to this concept of “what is learned.”"
8995,在这种情况下，我们就能根据一个非常普遍的抽象原理，即在前面讲过的那种循环应用规则原理，来解释感知和发音的某些方面。,"In this case, we can provide an explanation for a certain aspect of perception and articulation in terms of a very general abstract principle, namely the principle of cyclic application of rules (see page 38)."
8995,很难想象一个学习语音的人怎么能够从提供给他的资料中“归纳”出这种原理。,It is difficult to imagine how the language learner might derive this principle by “induction” from the data presented to him.
8995,事实上，在语言应用的正常条件下，这个原理的许多作用都与感知有关，而与物理信号本身很少有，或者几乎没有关联。所以，对一个还没有运用这种原理的人来说，那种作为归纳必须的基础的现象不能成为他的经验的一部分。,"In fact, many of the effects of this principle relate to perception and have little or no analogue in the physical signal itself, under normal conditions of language use, so that the phenomena on which the inductionwould have been based cannot be part of the experience of one who is not already making use of the principle."
8996,德里达使用“替补”（supplement）来表达言说/书写之类的二元对立概念之间的不稳定关系。,Derrida uses the term ‘supplement’ to convey the unstable relationship between couplets such as speech/writing.
8996,对卢梭来说，书写只是对言说的补充：它添加的东西是不重要的。,For Rousseau writing is merely a supplement to speech; it adds something inessential.
8996,在法语中，suppléer也表示“替换”（to substitute）的意思。德里达表明，书写不仅补充而且替代言说，因为言说总是已经书写成的了。,"In French, ‘suppléer’ also means ‘to substitute’ (to take the place of), and Derrida shows that writing not only supplements but also takes the place of speech, because speech is always already written."
8997,我们可以得出这样的结论，文学是种可以引起某种关注的言语行为，或者叫文本的活动。,"Literature, we might conclude, is a speech act or textual event that elicits certain kinds of attention."
8997,它与其他种类的言语行为不同，比如与告知信息、与提出问题或者做出承诺的言语行为都不同。,"It contrasts with other sorts of speech acts, such as imparting information, asking questions, or making promises."
8997,大多数情况下是那种可以把一些文字定义为文学的语境使读者把这些文字看作文学的，比如他们在一本诗集、一份杂志的某一部分，或者图书馆和书店里看到的那些东西。,"Most of the time what leads readers to treat something as literature is that they find it in a context that identifies it as literature: in a book of poems or a section of a magazine, library, or bookstore."
8998,岩洞中的绘画称为岩画，在西班牙北部阿尔塔米拉石窟就有发现，就是两万多年前人类的作品，我们至今仍能“读”到。,"Cave art, called petroglyphs, such as those found in the Altamira cave in northern Spain, created by humans living more than 20,000 years ago, can be “read” today."
8998,它们是当时人类生活的真实写照。,They are literal portrayals of life at that time.
8998,它们为何而作，我们不得而知，也许是一种审美的表达，而不是用图画来传递信息。,We don’t know why they were produced; they may be aesthetic expressions rather than pictorial communications.
8999,对拉康来说，阳物中心主义与符号的结构是不可分割的。,"For Lacan, the question of phallocentrism is inseparable from the structure of the sign."
8999,阳物作为一个能指做出完全在场和具有权利的诺言，这种在场和权利由于其不可获得，用“阉割情结”对两性形成威胁。,"The signifier, the phallus, holds out the promise of full presence and power, which, because it is unobtainable, threatens both sexes with the ‘castration complex’."
8999,社会与文化因素作为性别的刻板定式将强调或减弱这种无意识“缺失”的冲击，但是，“阳物”由于是一个完全在场的能指，而不是一个生理器官，依然是“阉割情结”的普遍来源。,"Social and cultural factors, such as gender stereotypes, will accentuate or diminish the impact of this unconscious ‘lack’, but the phallus, being a signifier of full presence and not a physical organ, remains a universal source of ‘castration complex’."
9000,所以，洋泾浜化 (洋泾浜的形成)意味着简化语言形式和减少使用领域。,Pidginization (the creation of a pidgin) thus involves a simplification of languages and a reduction in the number of domains of use.
9000,"与此相反, 克里奥尔化则需要对现存的洋泾浜词汇和语法进行语言扩展, 以及增加使用语境。","Creolization, in contrast, involves the linguistic expansion in the lexicon and grammar of existing pidgins, and an increase in the contexts of use."
9000,我们将在下一节进一步讨论克里奥尔语和克里奥尔化。,We discuss creoles and creolization further in the next section.
9001,但是这些构词策略有时候会适得其反。,"These strategies occasionally backfire, however."
9001,loosen和unloosen (松开），flammable和inflammable (易燃的），valuable和invaluable (珍贵的），还有一些其他的“假反义词”实际上意义相同或近似。其他的词汇关系包括同音形词、一词多义和下义词。像bear( 熊）和bare (光秃秃的）这样的 词是同音形词（又称“同音词”）。同音形词意义不同，但发音相同，而拼写则可能相同，也可能不同。,"Pairs such as loosen and unloosen; flammable and inflammable; valuable and invaluable, and a few other “antiautonyms” actually have the same or nearly the same meaning, despite looking like antonyms."
9001,尽管拼写不同，to (去，介词）、too (也）和two (二）是同音形词。,"Other lexical relations include homonyms, polysemy, and hyponyms."
9001,trunk(s)—词有三个意义（象鼻、行李箱、拳击短裤），也是同音形词。,
9002,其实，只要聋人聚集在一起生活就会发展出一个完整的语言出来，它跟世界上所有口语语言有一样复杂的文法机制。,"They are found wherever there is a community of deaf people, and each one is a distinct, full language, using the same kinds of grammatical machinery found worldwide in spoken languages."
9002,例如美国手势语言跟英文或是英国手势语言并不相像。但是它主语和动词的一致性和性系统的用法却很像美国的印地安语言的一支纳瓦霍语与非洲的班图语。,"For example, American Sign Language, used by the deaf community in the United States, does not resemble English, or British Sign Language, but relies on agreement and gender systems in a way that is reminiscent of Navajo and Bantu."
9003,然而，咿呀语并不是混乱的语言。,"However, babbling is not linguistic chaos."
9003,世界语言里12个最常见的辅音占到婴儿咿呀语里所用辅音的95%。,The twelve most frequent consonants in the world’s languages make up 95 percent of the consonants infants use in their babbling.
9003,可见即使在这么早的阶段，语言上就已经有了限制。,There are linguistic constraints even during this very early stage.
9003,"早期的咿呀语主要是一些重复的辅音-元音串，如mama,gaga,dada等。","The early babbles consist mainly of repeated consonant-vowel sequences, like mama, gaga, and dada."
9003,后期的咿呀语变化更多。,Later babbles are more varied.
9004,"短语的高层结构包括助词(INFL) , 它标明时式、情态、时态和否定。","The higher levels of phrase structure include auxiliaries (INFL),  which signifies tense, modality, aspect, and negation."
9004,名词用格来标示，用动词或其他述语在心理词汇中的特征来指定角色的意义。,Nouns are marked for case and assigned seman­tic roles by the mental dictionary entry of the verb or other predicate.
9004,短语可以从深层结构中移出，留下一个空隙或语迹，使它可以形成问句、相关子句、被动句及其他的架构。,"Phrases can be moved from their deep-structure positions, leaving a gap or ""trace,"" by a structure-dependent movement rule, thereby forming questions, relative clauses, passives, and other widespread constructions."
9005,但是另一方面，心理分析的巨大影响来自雅克·拉康的著作。拉康是一位反抗传统思想的法国心理分析学 家。他在传统的精神分析学之外又建立了自己的学派，并且领导了他提出的回归弗洛伊德的论证。,"But on the other hand, the greatest impact of psychoanalysis has come through the work of Jacques Lacan, a renegade French psychoanalyst who set up his own school outside the analytic establishment and led what he presented as a return to Freud."
9005,拉康把主体描绘成语言的结果，并且强调分析弗洛伊德所谓的移情的心理的至关重要的作用，在移情心理中，接受分析者把分析者放在过去经验中的权威人物的角色中（“爱上了你的分析者”）。,"Lacan describes the subject as an effect of language and emphasizes the crucial role in analysis of what Freud called transference, in which the analysand casts the analyst in the role of authority figure from the past (‘falling in love with your analyst’)."
9005,在这种情况中，病人的真正状况并不是分析者从病人的话语中理解分析出来的，而是分析者和病人同时陷入到病人过去的经 历中，扮演其中的重要情节，从中得出病人的真正状况。,"The truth of the patient’s condition, in this account, emerges not from the analyst’s interpretation of the patient’s discourse but from the way analyst and patient are caught up in replaying a crucial scenario fromthe patient’s past."
9006,转换规则解释句子之间的关系，比如陈述和疑问句对，包括wh问句。,"Transformational rules account for relationships between sentences such as declarative and interrogative pairs, including wh questions."
9006,转换可以移动句子的成分，或者在句子中插入类似do这样的功能词。,
9006,,Transformations can move constituents.
9006,句子的大部分意义是通过d-结构来解读的。,Much of the meaning of a sentence is interpreted from its d-structure.
9007,对遗传紊乱的研究还显示，一个认知领域正常发展的同时，其他一些认知区域却可能发展失常。这些研究也突出表现了语言强大的生物基础。,"Studies of genetic disorders also reveal that one cognitive domain can develop normally along with abnormal development in other domains, and they also underscore the strong biological basis of language."
9007,患有特纳氏综合征(一种染色体异常)的儿童语言发展正常，并且掌握了高级的阅读技巧，可是却有严重的非语言(视觉和空间的)认知缺陷。,Children with Turner syn- drome (a chromosomal anomaly) have normal language and advanced reading skills along with serious nonlinguistic (visual and spatial) cognitive deficits.
9008,第五章讨论语义学或者说语义问题，本章经过了从下至上的重写和重新编排。,
9008,,"Chapter 5, on semantics or meaning, has been more highly structuralized so that the challenging topics of this complex subject can be digested in smaller pieces."
9008,本章以“如果你懂得一种语言，那么你对语义有何认识”这一主题为基础，首先向学生介绍真值-条件语义学以及组构性原则。,"Still based on the theme of “What do you know about meaning when you know a language?”, the chapter first introduces students to truth-conditional semantics and the principle of compositionality."
9008,接下来是讨论组构性出毛病的时候会发生什么情况，比如习语、隐喻以及异常句子的情形。,"Following that are discussions of what happens when compositionality fails, as with idioms, metaphors, and anomalous sentences."
9009,巴尔特在讨论巴尔扎克的这一层次的逼真性时注意到，作家仿佛在同时运用七八本教科书，它们包括了人所共知的资产阶级文化的全部常识：一部实用医学手册（包括了各种疾病和症状的概念），一部心理学导论（一般公认的关于爱情、仇恨、恐惧之类的见解），一部基督教和斯多噶伦理学总纲，一部逻辑学，一部关于生、死、苦难、女人等成语格言大全，以及几部文学艺术史，它们既提供文化背景参照，又提供可供效仿的人物原型。,"Discussing this level of vraisemblance in Balzac, Barthes notes that it is as though the author had at his disposal seven or eight school manuals which contained the knowledge that constitutes popular bourgeois culture: a handbook of practical medicine (with notions of various illnesses and conditions), a rudimentary psychological treatise (generally accepted propositions about love, hatred, fear, etc.), a compendium of Christian and Stoic ethics, a logic, an anthology of proverbs and maxims on life, death, suffering, women, etc., and histories of literature and of art which provide both a set of cultural references and a repertoire of types (characters) which may serve as exempla."
9009,“虽然它们完全来自书本，可是，在被资产阶级意识形态所允许的关系颠倒之后，文化便转化为自然，上述种种代码便成为真实的关系，‘生活’的基础。”,"‘Although they may be entirely of bookish origin, these codes, by a reversal proper to bourgeois ideology, which turns culture into nature, serve as the foundation of the real, of “Life”’ (S/Z, p. 211)."
9010,此外，她还试图将语言与意识形态联系起来（这正是她当时交往很多的巴黎《泰凯尔》小圈子其他文人的共同取向），热衷于探讨巴赫金与梅德维杰夫的《文学研究的形式主义方法》，从而提出了“意识形态素”（ideologeme）的概念。,"In addition, seeking to connect the linguistic with the ideological (in common with other members of the Tel Quel group in Paris with which she was then associated), she draws on Bahktin and Medvedev's The Formal Method in Literary Scholarship to introduce the concept of the ‘ideologeme’."
9010,她用这一概念说明一个给定文本的篇章结构与一些广大的“外部文本”，或者用她的话说，一个“社会和历史的文本”之间的相互交叉。这个概念同样启示了后来詹姆逊等人使用的进一步拓展了的叙事文本性的观念（见其《政治无意识》，1981）。,"This she deploys to suggest the intersection of a given textual arrangement with a broader set of ‘exterior texts', or what she terms the text of society and history' – again anticipating later, more developed, notions of narrative textuality, as in Fredric Jameson (1981: see ‘Key texts’ for Chapter 5)."
9011,1888年国际语音学会编制出一套标音字母，也就是音标，来表示所有语言中的音。,In 1888 members of the International Phonetic Association developed a phonetic alphabet to symbolize the sounds of all languages.
9011,这套音标中有些是普通的罗马字母，也有些是新设计的。,They utilized both ordinary let- ters and invented symbols.
9011,每个音标在全世界任何语言中都只表示一个唯一的音值。,Each character of the alphabet had exactly one value across all of the world’s languages.
9011,懂了这套音标就能念出用音标来标写的词语，也能在听到一个词语后用音标来转写该词。,"Someone who knew this alphabet would know how to pronounce a word written in it, and upon hearing a word pronounced, would know how to write it using the alphabetic symbols."
9012,元音携有音高和响度，因此可以高低不同地唱元音，也可以强弱不同地喊元音。,Vowel sounds carry pitch and loudness; you can sing vowels or shout vowels.
9012,元音还可长可短。,They may be longer or shorter in duration.
9012,元音能独自成立，前后不必有辅音。,Vowels can stand alone—they can be produced without consonants before or after them.
9012,例如，你可以掐头去尾，只发 beat [bit](揍 )，bit[bit] (一点儿），boot [but](靴子）中的元音，而不发声母[b]和韵尾[t]。但要想单发一个[b]或[t]而不捎带一点儿元音则难多了。,"You can say the vowels of beat [bit], bit [bɪt], or boot [but], for example, without the initial [b] or the final [t], but you cannot say a [b] or a [t] alone without at least a little bit of vowel sound."
9013,英语是非声调语言，这样的语言叫语调语言。,"Languages that are not tone languages, such as English, are called intonation languages."
9013,说话时音高曲拱不断变化，但是语调语言跟声调语言不同，音高不是用于区别词义。,"The pitch contour of the utterance varies, but in an intonation language as opposed to a tone language, pitch is not used to distinguish words from each other."
9013,语调可以影响整个句子的含义，比如用降调说John is here (约翰在这里）是陈述语气，而用升调说就变成了疑问语气。,"Intonation may affect the meaning of whole sentences, so that John is here spoken with falling pitch at the end is interpreted as a statement, but with rising pitch at the end, a question."
9014,一个音位的某种特定实现(发音)叫作一个音素，同一个音位的所有音素集合，称作该音位的所有音位变体。,A particular realization (pronunciation) of a phoneme is called a phone.The collection of phones that are the realizations of the same phoneme are called the allophones of that phoneme.
9014,英语中，每一个元音音位都有口元音和鼻化元音两个音位变体。,"In English, each vowel phoneme has both an oral and a nasalized allophone."
9014,语言中音位变体的选择不是胡乱选的，而是有规律的。,The choice of the allophone is not random or haphazard; it is rule-governed.
9015,这一节介绍音位和音位变体的概念。,This section introduces the notions of phoneme and allophone.
9015,音位被我们称作是一个音的最基本形式，它存在于我们的心理感知中，但不能被说出或是听到。,Phonemes are what we have been calling the basic form of a sound and are sensed in your mind rather than spoken or heard.
9015,每个音位都和一个以上的音相关，这些音叫作音位变体，它们表达了该音位在不同环境下的真实音值。,"Each phoneme has associated with it one or more sounds, called allophones, which represent the actual sound corresponding to the phoneme in various environments."
9016,音段序列的限制被称为音位配列限制。,The limitations on sequences of segments are called phonotactic constraints.
9016,音位配列限制是音节的基础而不是词的基础。,"Phonotactic constraints have as their basis the syllable, rather than the word."
9016,也就是说，只有能成为音节首的组合才能成为词首，同样，只有能成为音节尾的组合才能成为词尾。,"That is, only the clusters that can begin a syllable can begin a word, and only a cluster that can end a syllable can end a word."
9017,从第六章语音学讨论中我们知道，[s]和 [z]的唯一差别是带声性；[s]不带声，[z]带声。就是这个语音特征区别了seal和zeal。,"From the discussion of phonetics in chapter 6, we know that [s] and [z] differ in voicing: [s] is voiceless and [z] is voiced.The phonetic feature of voicing therefore distinguishes the two words."
9017,这个特征还能区别feel(感觉)和veal(小牛肉)[t]/[v]，以及cap(帽子)和 cab(车厢)[p]/[b]。,Voicing also distinguishes feel and veal [f]/[v] and cap and cab [p]/[b].
9017,"如果一个特征能区别开两个音位，从而区分开两个词,它就是区别特征(即音位特征)。","When a feature distinguishes one phoneme from another, hence one word from another, it is a distinctive feature or, equivalently, a phonemic feature."
9018,音系学研究的是语音如何组合成型。,The study of how speech sounds form patterns is phonology.
9018,这些音型可简单可复杂。简单的音型，例如英语的音节首不能出现软腭鼻音[ŋ];复杂的音型，例如为什么g在sign—词中不发音，但在其派生词signature 中却又是发音的。,"These patterns may be as simple as the fact that the velar nasal cannot begin a syllable in English, or as complex as why g is silent in sign but is pronounced in the related word signature."
9018,"注意，这是种音型，而不是个例外。不妨想想，这种区别同样出现在autumn和autumnal中的n, 或是bomb和 bombard中的b上 。","To see that this is a pattern and not a one-time exception, just consider the slippery n in autumn and autumnal, or the b in bomb and bombard."
9019,语言的音系规则——决定发音的规则——适用于s-结构 。,The phonological rules of the language—the ones that determine pronunciation—apply to s- structures.
9019,如果无法进行转换，那么d-结构和s-结构相同。,"If no transformations apply, then d-structure and s-structure are the same."
9019,如果进行转换，那么s-结构就是所有的转换完成之后得出的结果。,"If transformations apply, then s-structure is the result after all transformations have had their effect."
9019,很大一部分无法用短语结构规则描述的句法知识可以用转换来解释。转换可以通过移动、增加和删除树的组成部分而改变短语结构树。,"Many sentence types are accounted for by transformations, which can alter phrase structure trees by moving, adding, or deleting elements."
9020,调音部位、方式相同的语音有可能长短不同。,Speech sounds that are identical in their place or manner features may differ in length (duration).
9020,英语中紧元音一般比松元音长，不过只是稍长一点，大约几十毫秒。,"Tense vowels are slightly longer than lax vowels, but only by a few milliseconds."
9020,但在有些语言中长元音可能长出一倍，这能用来区别词义。,"However, in some languages when a vowel is prolonged to around twice its normal length, it can make a difference between words."
9020,"例如日语中biru [biru] 是 “建筑”，如果是长i，biiru[bi:ru],那就是“啤酒”了。（形如冒号的：是IPA表示音段长或者音程加倍的符号。）","In Japanese the word biru [biru] with a regular i means “building,” but with the i doubled in length as in biiru, spelled phonetically as [biːru], the meaning is “beer.” (The colon-like ː is the IPA symbol for segment length or doubling.) In Japanese vowel length can make the difference between two words."
9021,这些推论被称为隐涵。,Such inferences are known as implicatures.
9021,隐涵是根据话语所表达的内容做出的演绎，但不是严格推理出来的。,Implicatures are deductions that are not made strictly on the basis of the content expressed in the discourse.
9021,倒不如说，隐涵是根据会话准则，同时考虑话段的语言意义以及说话时的特定情境而得到的。,"Rather, they are made in accordance with the conversational maxims, taking into account both the linguistic meaning of the utterance as well as the particular circumstances in which the utterance is made."
9022,这是因为几千年前印欧语系的原型，它是英语和大多数欧洲语言的祖先。它有一条规则：把动词改为被动式时要变换母音，就好像我们现在加-ed一样。,"This is because thousands of years ago Proto-Indo-European, the language ancestral to English and most other European languages, had rules that replaced one vowel with another to form the past tense, just as we now have a rule that adds -ed."
9022,这个规则现在已经不存在了，这些不规则动词是当年留下来的化石。,The irregular or “strong” verbs in modern English are mere fossils of these rules; the rules themselves are dead and gone.
9023,例如，在美国，我一直未找到在一个世纪前印行的波尔•罗瓦雅尔很重要的一本书——《语法》。虽然现在又找到了法文版，但这一重要著作的英文翻译只能在大不列颠博物馆里见到。,"For example, I have been unable to locate a single copy, in the United States, of the only critical edition of the Port-Royal Grammar, produced over a century ago; and although the French original is now once again available, the English translation of this important work is apparently to be found only in the British Museum."
9023,这本书遭到如此冷落真令人遗憾，因为人们不知道的内容恰恰是引人入胜的和富于启发性的。,"It is a pity that this work should have been so totally disregarded, since what little is known about it is intriguing and quite illuminating."
9024,各种实验技术方法都被用来研究句子理解。,Various experimental techniques are used to study sentence comprehension.
9024,除了启动和阅读实验之外，在影子跟读任务中，要求受试者尽可能快地重复他们听到的内容。,"In addition to the priming and reading tasks, in a shadowing task subjects are asked to repeat what they hear as rapidly as possible."
9024,特别优秀的影子跟读者能够在听到所说的词语的一个音节之后（约300毫秒）开始跟读。,Exceptionally good shadowers canfollow what is being said only about a syllable behind (300 milliseconds).
9024,然而，我们大多数人影子跟读的迟滞时间是500—800毫秒，这仍然相当快了。,"Most of us, however, shadow with a delay of 500 to 800 milliseconds, which is still quite fast."
9025,有一种观点认为存在音系限制的普遍集合，且此集合是有序的，某些限制相对其他限制处于更高的级别。,"It has also been proposed that a universal set of phonological constraints exists, and that this set is ordered, with some constraints being more highly ranked than others."
9025,限制的级别越高，对该语言所施加的影响越大。,"The higher the constraint is ranked, the more influence it exerts on the language."
9025,这种观点称作优选论，认为不同的语言，其限制的级别顺序也不一样，而不同的限制级别顺序导致了各种语言中不同的音型。,"This proposal, known as Optimality Theory, also holds that the particular constraint rankings can differ from language to language,and that the different rankings generate the different sound patterns shown across languages."
9026,句法规则反映的是句子中词、词序以及层级结构之间的关系。,Syntactic rules reveal the grammatical relations among the words of a sentence as well as their order and hierarchical organization.
9026,句法规则也阐释词的分组如何与其意义相关，比如什么时候一个句子或者短语会有歧义。,"They also explain how the grouping of words relates to its meaning, such as when a sentence or phrase is ambiguous."
9026,除此之外，句法规则让说话者得以说出或理解之前从未说过或听过的无限量的句子，这就是语言知识的创造性。,"In addition, the rules of the syntax permit speakers to produce and understand a limitless number of sentences never produced or heard before—the creative aspect of linguistic knowledge."
9027,,. . .
9027,语言学家布蕾丝南最近写了一个报告，她随机选了一个未开发国家的语言与英语作比较。她选的是住在坦桑尼亚山下，几个村落人所说的奇温久语——班图语的一种——的结构。她将这种语言描述为“一种在英国及其前属殖民地使用的西日耳曼语”。,"the linguist Joan Bresnan recently wrote a technical article comparing a construction in Kivunjo, a Bantu language spoken in several villages on the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, with its counterpart construction in English, which she describes as “a West Germanic language spoken in England and its former colonies.”"
9027,这种英语结构叫做“与格”，是将间接受词（如下面句子中的me和her）放在动词的后面来表示一个动作的接受者，例如She baked me a brownie(她烤了一盘巧克力糕给我)和He promised her Arpege。,"The English construction is called the dative and is found in sentences like “She baked me a brownie” and “He promised her Arpege”, where an indirect object like “me” or “her” is placed after the verb to indicate the beneficiary of an act."
9028,这在哼唱时最明显，但是我们也可以在说一个句话时改变它声调的高低度，这叫语调。,"This is most obvious in humming or singing, but we also change pitch continuously over the course of a sentence, a process called intonation."
9028,正常的语调是人说的话和机器说的话最大不同的地方。早期的科幻电影及“星期六周末现场” 这个电视节目中的Conehead(外星人，头形是圆锥状）所说的话，就是平板没有语调的。,Normal intonation is what makes natural speech sound different from the speech of robots in old science fiction movies and of the Coneheads on Saturday Night Live.
9029,我们一眼即能看出，格雷马斯对普洛普的重新阐释正是按照施特劳斯的“音素”模式的方向进行的。,It can be seen at a glance that Greimas’ reworking of Propp is in the direction of the ‘phonemic’ patterning we saw in Lévi-Strauss.
9029,在这一点上，格雷马斯与俄国形式主义者普洛普相比是更真正的“结构主义者”，他是从实体之间的关系而不是实体人物本身去思考问题的。,"In this respect Greimas is more truly ‘structuralist’ than the Russian Formalist Propp, in that the former thinks in terms of relations between entities rather than of the character of entities in themselves."
9029,为了解释各种可能的叙事序列，他把普洛普的31种功能缩减为20种，并把它们分成了3种 结构（语段）：“契约的”（contractual）、“践行的”（performative）、“分离的”（disjunctive）。,"In order to account for the various narrative sequences which are possible he reduces Propp’s thirty-one functions to twenty, and groups them into three structures (syntagms): ‘contractual’, ‘performative’ and ‘disjunctive’."
9030,"语法分析程序是一种计算机程序,它尝试模拟我们称为“心理分析器”的一种人脑官能。",A parser is a computer program that attempts to replicate what we have been calling the “mental parser.”
9030,与心理分析器一样，计算机中的分析器利用语法把一个短语结构指派给一个词汇串。,"Like the mental parser, the parser in a computer uses a grammar to assign a phrase structure to a string of words."
9030,它所利用的短语结构语法和词库与我们在第四章中讨论过的相似。,Parsers may use a phrase structure grammar and lexicon similar to those discussed in chapter 4.
9031,通过应用这些技术对那些经外科手术切除了部分脑的病人、分裂脑患者和失语症（因脑损伤导致的语言障碍）患者进行研究，人们就可以发现脑的局部区域与特定的语言功能相关联。,"These techniques permit the study of the living brain as it processes language.By studying split-brain patients and aphasics, localized areas of the brain can be associated with particular language functions."
9031,例如，大脑的布罗卡区受损的病人，可能患上布罗卡失语症，它常造成患者的句法障碍和语法缺失。,"For example, lesions in the part of the brain called Broca’s area may suffer from Broca’s aphasia, which results in impaired syntax and agrammatism."
9031,韦尼克区受损的病人，则可能患上韦尼克失语症，患者说流利但语义异常的话语。更严重的是杂乱性失语症，患者说无意义的语言形式，因此无从理解。,"Damage to Wernicke’s area may result in Wernicke’s aphasia, in which fluent speakers produce semantically anomalous utterances, or even worse, jargon aphasia, in which speakers produce nonsense forms that make their utterance uninterpretable."
9032,关于写作的符号学这一方面最吸引人的论点之一是由雅克徳里达提出的。他提出要创立一门书面符号的科学叫作语法学。,"One of the most interesting arguments concerning this aspect of the semiotics  of  writing  has  been  offered  by  Jacques  Derrida,  who  proposes  a  ‘science’  of  the  written  sign,  called  grammatology."
9032,他的三本著作《语法学》、《文字和差异》和《声音和现象》（均出版于1967年）事实上代表了在对写作的本质和地位进行重新估价这一问题上的一场持久的论争。,"His  three books, De La Grammatologie, L’Ecriture et la Différence and La Voix et le phénomène (all  published  in  1967)  in  fact  represent  a  sustained  argument  for  an assessment of the nature and status of writing."
9033,“结构从属的操作”这一基本概念，从来没有得到严格的数学考察。,The basic concept of “structure-dependent operation” has never even been considered in a strictly mathematical concept.
9033,这种混乱的根源对于普特南来说就构成对语法转换本性的一个误解。,The source of this confusion is a misconception on Putnam’s part as to the nature of grammatical transformations.
9033,语法转换不是“缩写”句子的规则，而是从底层的深层结构中形成表层结构的操作，正如在以上讲座及其引用的资料中所表明的那样。,"They are not rules that “abbreviate” sentences; rather, they are operations that form surface structures from underlying deep structures, in such ways as are illustrated in the preceding lecture and the references there cited."
9034,如果我们一定要一个总的原则或者公式的话，或许可以说，意义是由语境决定的。因为语境包括语言规则、作者和读者的背景，以及任何其他能想像得出的相关信息。,"If we must adopt some overall principle or formula, we might say that meaning is determined by context, since context includes rules of language, the situation of the author and the reader, and anything else that might conceivably be relevant."
9034,但是，如果我们说意义是由语境限定的，那我们必须要补充说明一点，即语境是没有限定的：没有什么可以预先决定哪些是相关的，也不能决定什么样的语境扩展会改变我们认定的文本意义。,"But if we say that meaning is context-bound, then we must add that context is boundless: there is no determining in advance what might count as relevant, what enlarging of context might be able to shift what we regard as the meaning of a text."
9034,意义由语境限定，而语境没有限定。,"Meaning is context-bound, but context is boundless."
9035,由于儿童发育的速度不一样，而且开始说话和遣词造句的年纪也各不相同，因此用实际年龄来衡量儿童语言的发展并不合适。研究人员用儿童的“语句平均长度”（MLU)来比较其语言进展。MLU是指儿童在某特定时期所产生语句的平均长度。,"Because children mature at different rates and the age at which children start to produce words and put words together varies, chronological age is not a good measure of a child’s language development.Instead, researchers use the child’s mean length of utterances (MLU) to measure progress."
9036,乔纳森•斯威夫特曾预言计算机在语言方面的一种应用就是统计分析。,Jonathan Swift prophesied one application of computers to language: statistical analysis.The relative frequencies (i.e.
9036,任何文本或口头输入材料中的字母和语音、语素、词、词范畴、短语类型等等的相对使用频率（即“总体比例”）都可以迅速并且准确无误地计算出来。这样的输入材料又称语料库。.,", the “general proportions”) of letters and sounds, morphemes, words, word categories, types of phrases, and so on may be swiftly and accurately computed for any corpus (body of language data), whether textual or spoken."
9037,我们是怎么知道这些复数语素是怎么发音的呢？,How do we know how to pronounce this plural morpheme?
9037,它们的拼写方式，无论是s还是es，都起着误导作用——一个z都没有——除非你会说英语，才能读得像我们刚刚说的那样。,"The spelling, which adds s or es, is misleading—not a z in sight—yet if you know English, you pronounce it as we indicated."
9037,当遇到这种问题的时候，比较有效的办法是列个表，把该语素的每个变体（一个更专业的叫法是语素变体）所出现的语音环境给记录下来。,"When faced with this type of question, it’s useful to make a chart that records the phonological environments in which each variant of the morpheme is known to occur.(The more technical term for a variant is allomorph.)"
9037,用宽式记音把前三列的词写下来，我们就得到一个关于复数语素的列表。,"Writing the words from the first three columns in broad phonetic transcription, we have our first chart for the plural morpheme."
9038,探索UG的属性，是语言学理论的一个主要目的。,It is a major aim of linguistic theory to discover the nature of UG.
9038,正如物理学家的目标在于揭示“物理世界的规律”一样，语言学家的目标在于揭示“人类语言的规律”。,The linguist’s goal is to reveal the “laws of human language” as the physicist’s goal is to reveal the “laws of the physical universe.”
9038,作为人脑的产物，语言的复杂性无疑意味着这个目标永远不会完全实现。,"The complexity of language, a product of the human brain, undoubtedly means this goal will never be fully achieved."
9038,一切具备科学性的理论都是不完备的，必须提出新的假设来解释新的事实材料。,"All scientific theories are incomplete, and new hypotheses must be proposed to account for new data."
9038,随着人们不断发现新的事物，理论也不断发生变化。,Theories are continually changing as new discoveries are made.
9039,掌握一种语言就意味着掌握该语言的语素，语素才是构词的元素单元。,"Knowing a language means knowing the morphemes of that language, which are the elemental units that constitute words."
9039,所以，moralizers(说教者）是一个由4个语素构成的英语词：moral+ize+er+s 。,Moralizers is an English word composed of four morphemes: moral + ize + er + s.
9039,当你掌握了一个词或者语素时，你就懂得它的两个方面，即形式（发音）和意义，两者都是语言符号不可或缺的组成部分。,"When you know a word or morpheme, you know both its form (sound or gesture) and its meaning; these are inseparable parts of the linguistic sign."
9039,形式与意义之间的关系具有任意性。,The relationship between form and meaning is arbitrary.
9039,它们之间没有固有的联系（也就是说，学任何一种语言，都必须学习它的词和语素）。,"There is no inherent connection between them (i.e., the words and morphemes of any language must be learned)."
9040,萨丕尔-沃尔夫假说最强的形式称为语言决定论，因为它认为我们所说的语言译牟我们对世界的感知和思考。,The strongest form of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is called linguistic determinism because it holds that the language we speak determines how we perceive and think about the world.
9040,从这一观点来看，语言的作用就像是现实的一个过滤器。,On this view language acts like a filter on reality.
9040,"沃尔夫用以支持语言决定论的一个最有名的主张，就是霍皮印第安人对时间的感知和说欧洲语言的人不同，因为霍皮语不像英语那样对时态作语法上的区别，比如使用词或者词尾did,will,shall,-s,-ed 和-ing。","One of Whorf’s best-known claims in support of linguistic determinism was that the Hopi Indians do not perceive time in the same way as speakers of European languages because the Hopi language does not make the grammatical distinctions of tense that, for example, English does with words and word endings such as did, will, shall, -s, -ed, and -ing."
9041,几乎所有关于语言起源的“理论”——无论听起来多么愚蠢和迷信，都相信所有语言有单一的来源，即语言起源的单源论。,"Nearly all “theories” of language origin, however silly and superstitious, contain the implicit belief that all languages originated from a single source—the monogenetic theory of language origin."
9041,与此相对的是语言起源于多个地方、历史上的多个时间。,"Opposing this is the proposition that language arose in several places, or at several times, in the course of history."
9041,这些观点仍在语言学界广受争议。,Which of these is true is still debated by linguists.
9042,该假说比较温和的一个形式是语言相对论，认为不同的语言对不同的范畴编码，因此说不同语言的人对世界的思考有不同的方式。,"A weaker form of the hypothesis is linguistic relativism, which says that different languages encode different categories and that speakers of different languages therefore think about the world in different ways."
9042,比如，不同的语言在色谱上截取颜色的分界点不同。,"For example, languages break up the color spectrum at different points."
9042,在印第安纳瓦霍语里，蓝色和绿色是同一个词。,"In Navaho, blue and green are one word."
9042,俄语中的深蓝色和天蓝色用不同的词表示，而在英语里，我们需要用dark(深）和sky(天）来区别其中的差异。,"Russian has different words for dark blue (siniy) and light blue (goluboy), while in English we need to use the additional words dark and light to express the difference."
9043,列维-斯特劳斯有意识地以结构主义语言学，尤其是特鲁伯兹考(Troubetzkoy)和雅各布逊(Jakobson)的工作，作为自己研究的模型。,"L´evi-Strauss models his investigations quite consciously on structural linguistics, particularly on the work of Troubetzkoy and Jakobson."
9043,他反复地、也是很正确地强调，不能简单地把类似于音素分析的步骤应用于社会和文化的亚系统上。,He repeatedly and quite correctly emphasizes that one cannot simply apply procedures analogous to those of phonemic analysis to subsystems of society and culture.
9043,与此相反，他关心的是那些“能够在亲缘系统、政治意识形态、神话学、礼仪、艺术等中找到”的结构，并希望用这些结构自身的关系来考察这些结构的形式性质。,"Rather, he is concerned with structures “where they may be found . . . in the kinship system, political ideology, mythology, ritual, art,” and so on,8 and he wishes to examine the formal properties of these structures in their own terms."
9043,但是对于这种把结构语言学如此用做模型的作法，有必要做一些保留。,But several reservations are necessary when structural linguistics is used as a model in this way.
9044,语用学讲的是语言意义在语境中的解释。,Pragmatics is concerned with our understanding of language in context.
9044,有两种互相关联的语境。,Two kinds of contexts are relevant.
9044,第一种是语言语境--需要解释的短语或句子上文中的话语；第二种是情景语境--实际上包括说话者所处环境中所有非语言的东西。,The first is linguistic context—the discourse that precedes the phrase or sentence to be interpreted; the second is situational context—virtually everything nonlinguistic in the environment of the speaker.
9045,这一知识（语言能力）不同于行为（语言运用）。,This knowledge (linguistic competence) is different from behavior (linguistic performance).
9045,假如有天早晨你醒来后决定停止说话（就像天主教特拉普修道士起誓沉默后那样），但你仍然有关于自己语言的知识。,"If you woke up one morning and decided to stop talking (as the Trappist monks did after they took a vow of silence), you would still have knowledge of your language."
9045,这一语言能力是潜藏于语言行为背后的。,This ability or competence underlies linguistic behavior.
9045,如果你没掌握这种语言，你就不会说这种语言；但你如果掌握了，你却可以选择不说。,"If you do not know the language, you cannot speak it; but if you knowthe language, you may choose not to speak."
9046,这样，从波尔•罗瓦雅尔的理论中可以得出这样合乎逻辑的结论：一种语言的语法必定包含一个规则系统。该规则系统描述了深层结构和表层结构的特征以及二者之间的转换关系。如果要容纳语言运用的创造性的话，该系统还适用于无数对深层-表层结构。,"Following the Port-Royal theory to its logical conclusions, then, the grammar of a language must contain a system of rules that characterizes deep and surface structures and the transformational relation between them, and – if it is to accommodate the creative aspect of language use – that does so over an infinite domain of paired deep and surface structures."
9047,在本章中我们讨论的是您所拥有的语言学知识，运用语言学知识，您能够判断句子真假，判断一个句子在何时衍推另一个句子，判断句子是否有歧义。,"In this section we discuss the linguistic knowledge you have that permits you to determine whether a sentence is true or false, when one sentence implies the truth or falsehood of another, and whether a sentence has multiple meanings."
9047,"解释这种语法知识的一个方法是, 通过制定语义规则, 从词的含义和句法组合来构建句子的意义。",One way to account for this knowledge is by formulating semantic rules that build the meaning of a sentence from the meaning of its words and the way the words combine syntactically.
9047,这通常被称作真值条件语义学，因为它需要以真值语义知识为基础。,This is often called truth-conditional semantics because it takes speakers’ knowledge of truth conditions as basic.
9048,词汇提取的许多特征可以通过词汇判定实验来检验。,Many properties of lexical access can be examined using lexical decision experiments.
9048,在以下例子中，当前呈现的词和刚刚呈现过的词之间的关系被控制起来。,"In the following example, the relationship between the current word and the immediately preceding word is manipulated."
9048,例如，当受试者判定doctor(医生）一词时，倘若刚刚判定的词是nurse (护士），而不是与doctor语义上毫无关系的词，如flower(花朵），那么前者判定的速度就更快。,"For example, making a lexical decision on the word doctor will be faster if you just made a lexical decision on nurse than if you just made one on a semantically unrelated word such as flower."
9048,这种效应称为“语义启动”：我们说mirse—词启动doctor—词。,This effect is known as semantic priming: we say that the word nurse primes the word doctor.
9048,这种效应的成因也许在于语义相关的词处于心理词库的同一区域，因此，当我们听到一个启动词并在心理词库中查寻它时，它附近语义上与之相关的词会被“唤醒”，更容易在短时间内提取。,"This effect might arise because semantically related words are located in the same part of the mental lexicon, so when we hear a priming word and look it up in the lexicon, semantically related, nearby words are “awakened” and more readily accessible for a few moments."
9049,为了确定某一词汇单元的语义构成，必须考虑该词素在一整套文本和摘要中的全部读义，即语义素，以此作为词义的内核构成成分，即全部语义素所共有的特征。,"To determine the semantic composition of a particular lexical item, one considers all the readings or 'sememes' that the lexeme has in a corpus and extracts, as components of the noyau sémique, those features shared by all sememes."
9049,而意义的变化则简化为一系列语境意胚的变化。,The variations in meaning are reduced to a series of alternative contextual semes.
9049,这第一阶段的描述，即从语义特征入手对词素进行分析，可视为这种语言的一部词典的形成过程。,"This ﬁrst stage of description, the analysis of lexemes in terms of semantic features, may be thought of as the formalization of a dictionary of the language."
9050,在前面的几个小节中我们讨论了词与真实世界中物体相关的意义，这使得我们可以推导出一种基于真值的语义学。,"In the previous sections we discussed word meaning in relation to objects in the world, and this permitted us to develop a truth-based semantics."
9050,我们还探讨了词与其他词相关的意义。,We also explored the meaning of words in relation to other words.
9050,然而，寻找更加基本的一套语义特征或特性也是可能的，它们是词义的组成部分，并反映出我们对于词意味着什么所具有的直觉。,But it is also possibleto look for a more basic set of semantic features or properties that are part of word meanings and that reflect our knowledge about what words mean.
9051,动词在词条中还对这一动词的主语和补足语内在的语义特征做出说明，类似于它们对句法范畴的选择。,"Verbs also include in their lexical entry a specification of certain intrinsic semantic properties of their subjects and complements, just as they select for syntactic categories."
9051,这种选择称为S-选择（S代表semantic“语义的 ”)。,This kind of selection is called S-selection (S for semantic).
9051,例如，动词murder的主语和宾语应该都人，而动词drink的主语应该是有生命的，而宾语是液体。,"For example, the verb murder requires its subject and object to be human, while the verb drink requires its subject to be animate and its object liquid."
9051,像like，hate这样的动词要选择有生主语作为主语。,"Verbs such as like, hate, and so on select animate subjects."
9052,人们或许期望语义学成为语言学的一个分支，使文学批评家觉得它非常有用。,One might expect semantics to be the branch of linguistics which literary critics would ﬁnd most useful.
9052,如果确有这样一个领域，在这个领域中，语言学描述的方法能卓有成效地应用于文学语言，那么，这就是语言意义的领域。,"If there is any realm where the methods of linguistic description could with proﬁt be applied to the language of literature, it is that of meaning."
9052,哪一位批评家不曾幻想过一种把文本的意义描述得毫厘不差的科学方法，一种得到验证的最佳方法，说明哪些意义是可能的，哪些是不可能的呢？,"What critic does not in his moments dream of a scientiﬁcally rigorous way of characterizing the meaning of a text, of demonstrating with tools of proven appropriateness that certain meanings are possible and others impossible?"
9053,为了运用形态和句法规则，孩子必须了解他所说的语言中这些词语的句法范畴。,In order to apply morphological and syntactic rules the child must know what syntactic categories the words in his language belong to.
9053,但是孩子究竟怎么会知道play（玩耍）和want（想要）是动词，tune（曲调）和house（房子）是名词呢？,But how exactly does the child come to know that play and want are verbs and tune and house are nouns?
9053,一种说法是孩子们最初使用某个词的意思是为了弄明白它的范畴。,One suggestion is that children first use the meaning of the word to figure out its category.
9053,这就叫做语义引导。,This is called semantic bootstrapping.
9054,同样的口鼻对立也见于raid [red](袭击)和 rain [ren](下雨)、rug [rʌg](地毯) 和 rung [rʌŋ]。,"The same oral/nasal difference occurs in raid [red] and rain [ren], rug [rʌg] and rung [rʌŋ]."
9054,发[d]和[g]时软腭抬起，不让空气从鼻腔流出。而发[n]和[ŋ]时软腭垂下，空气从鼻子里流出，等到除阻时，还从口腔流出。,"The velum is raised in the production of [d] and [g], preventing the air from flowing through the nose, whereas for [n] and [ŋ] the velum is down, allowing the air out through both the nose and the mouth when the closure is released."
9054,因而[m]，[n]和[ŋ]是鼻音，[b]，[d]，[g]是口音。根据鼻音和浊音这两个语音特征出现与否，我们可以把所有语音分为四类：浊音、清音、鼻音、口音。,"The sounds [m], [n], and [ŋ] are therefore nasal sounds, and [b], [d], and [g] are oral sounds.The presence or absence of these phonetic features—nasal and voiced—permit the division of all speech sounds into four classes: voiced, voiceless, nasal, and oral."
9055,我们发现[k]和[x]不处于互补分布中；它们都只出现于后元音前面。,We see that [k] and [x] are not in complementary distribution; they both occur before back vowels.
9055,[c]和[ç]也不是互补分布，它们只出现于前元音前面。,Nor are [c] and [ç] in complementary distribution.They both occur before front vowels.
9055,但塞音[k]和[c]处于互补分布；[k]出现于后元音和[r]的前面，从不出现在前元音前面。,"But the stops [k] and [c] are in complementary distribution; [k] occurs before back vowels and [r], and never occurs before front vowels."
9055,而[c]只出现在前元音前面，不出现在后元音和[r]的前面。,"Similarly, [c] occurs only before front vowels and never before back vowels or [r]."
9055,最后，[x]和[ç]也因为同样的理由，处于互补分布。,"Finally, [x] and [ç] are in complementary distribution for the same reason."
9055,所以，我们知道[k]和[c]是同一音位的音位变体，擦音[x]和[ç]也是同一音位 的音位变体。,"We therefore conclude that [k] and [c] are allophones of one phoneme, and the fricatives [x] and [ç] are also allophones of one phoneme."
9055,这两对音位变体也满足语音相似性的标准。,The pairs of allophones also fulfill the criterion of phoneti similarity.
9055,"前者都是[-前]塞音，后者都是[-前]擦音 (如果比较[k]和[ç]，以及[c]和[x ],就会发现没那么相似）。","The first two are [–anterior] stops; the second are [–anterior] fricatives.(This similarity discourages us from pairing [k] with [ç], and [c] with [x], which are less similar to each other.)"
9056,音位表征只包括表示词的音位链的不可预见的区别特征，从运用这些规则而派生的语音表征才包括所有跟语言学有关的各方面语音情况，但不包括话语语音的所有物理性质，因为物理信号在许 多方面多变而对音系几无关系。,"The phonemic representation should include only the nonpredictable, distinctive features of the phonemes in a word.The phonetic representation, derived by applying the phonological rules, includes all of the linguistically relevant phonetic aspects of the sounds.It does not include all of the physical properties of the sounds of an utterance, however, because the physical signal may vary in many ways that have little to do with the phonological system."
9056,语音的绝对音高、言语的速度或响度在语言学上没什么意义。,"The absolute pitch of the sound, the rate of speech, or its loudness is not linguistically significant."
9056,因此，语音转写也是一个物理信号的抽象，它包括话语中不变的语音部分，也就是那些人跟人之间，此时彼时之间保持相对一致的特征。,"The phonetic transcription is therefore also an abstraction from the physical signal; it includes the nonvariant phonetic aspects of the utterances, those features that remain relatively constant from speaker to speaker and from one time to another."
9057,理论家们最近又对认同的根本作用做了进一步的解释。,Theorists have recently given a further twist to the fundamental role of identification.
9057,米克尔•博尔奇-雅各布森论证说：欲望（怀有欲望的主体）不是最先出现的，能够使欲望得以实现的认同不是随其后的。,"Mikkel Borch-Jakobsen argues that Desire (the desiring subject) does not come first, to be followed by an identification that would allow the desire to be fulfilled."
9057,首先出现的应该是一种认同的倾向，一种最基本最原始的倾向，是这种倾向使欲望得以产生 ……是认同使富有欲望的主体存在，而不是相反。,"What comes first is a tendency toward identification, a primordial tendency which then gives rise to a desire...; identification brings the desirous subject into being, not the other way around."
9057,在此前的模式中，欲望是基础；这里认同先于欲望，而且与另外-个主体的认同包括了模仿或者竞争，这两者才是欲望的源头。,"In the earlier model, desire is the bottom line; here identification precedes desire, and the identification with another involves imitation or rivalry that is the source of desire."
9057,这一点与小说的情节是相符的.正如勒内·格里亚德和伊夫·塞奇威克所论证的：欲望由认同和竞争而起，异性恋中的男性欲望是从男主人公与一个竞争对手的认同和对他的欲望的模仿中流泄出来的。,"This accords with scenarios in novels where, as René Girard and Eve Sedgwick argue, desire arises from identification and rivalry: heterosexual male desire flows from the hero’s identification with a rival and imitation of his desire."
9058,这些事实描述体现的不是关于事实的“谎言”，而是如何认识、命名和表达这的一些成熟的精密的方法。,
9058,它们不单是现实的装饰，而且是应付现实的一种方法：“因此，人们学会的最初的科学应该是神话学或者是对寓言的解释；因为，就如我们将看到的，任何民族的历史都肇始于寓言。,"They constitute not mere embroidery of reality, but a way of coping with it: ‘It follows that the first science to be learned should be mythology or the interpretation of fables; for, as we shall see, all the histories of the gentiles have their beginnings in fables.’"
9058,”,
9059,许多早期的研究（20世纪60年代以前）表明，在智商与其他认知和教育测试中双语儿童比单语儿童表现要差一些。,
9059,最近的研究结果显示，在解决某些类型的问题时，双语儿童要比单语儿童出色。,The results of more recent research indicate that bilingual children outperform monolinguals in certain kinds of problem solving.
9059,双语儿童还似乎有更好的元语言意识——说话者关吾言和语言使用的自觉意识。,"Also, bilingual children seem to have better metalinguistic awareness, which refers to a speaker’s conscious awareness about language rather than of language."
9060,从某种意义上说，罗曼族诸语都是拉丁语的子孙，拉丁语就好比它们的先辈。,"In a sense, the Romance languages are the offspring of Latin, their metaphorical parent."
9060,因为它们有共同的先，各种罗曼语是有谱系关系的。,"Because of their common ancestry, the Romance languages are genetically related."
9060,早期的英语和德语也是一样的，是同一祖语的方言，他们的共同祖语是原始日耳曼语。,"Early forms of English and German, too, were once dialects of a common ancestor called Proto-Germanic."
9060,所谓原始语就是一组亲属语的 共同祖语，这些语言都从它发展而来。,A protolanguage is the ancestral language from which related languages have developed.
9060,拉丁语和原始日耳曼语都是一个更古老的语言—印欧语或原始印欧语一一的后代。,Both Latin and ProtoGermanic were descendants of an older language called Indo-European or Proto-Indo-European.
9060,因此英语、德语等日耳曼语与法语、西班牙等罗曼语是有谱系关系的。,"Thus, Germanic languages such as English and Germanare genetically related to the Romance languages such as French and Spanish."
9060,所有这些重要的民族语，一度都只是地域方言而已。,All these national languages were once regional dialects.
9061,从某种意义上说，罗曼族诸语都是拉丁语的子孙，拉丁语就好比它们的先辈。,"In a sense, the Romance languages are the offspring of Latin, their meta-phorical parent."
9061,因为它们有共同的先，各种罗曼语是有谱系关系的。,"Because of their common ancestry, the Romance languages are genetically related."
9061,早期的英语和德语也是一样的，是同一祖语的方言，他们的共同祖语是原始日耳曼语。,"Early forms of English and German, too, were once dialects of a common ancestor called Proto Germanic."
9061,所谓原始语就是一组亲属语的 共同祖语，这些语言都从它发展而来。,A protolanguage is the ancestral language from which related languages have developed.
9061,拉丁语和原始日耳曼语都是一个更古老的语言—印欧语或原始印欧语一一的后代。,Both Latin and Proto- Germanic were descendants of an older language called Indo-European or Proto-Indo-European.
9061,因此英语、德语等日耳曼语与法语、西班牙等罗曼语是有谱系关系的。,"Thus, Germanic languages such as English and German are genetically related to the Romance languages such as French and Spanish."
9061,所有这些重要的民族语，一度都只是地域方言而已。,All these national languages were once regional dialects.
9062,从某种意义上说，罗曼族诸语都是拉丁语的子孙，拉丁语就好比它们的先辈。,"In a sense, the Romance languages are the offspring of Latin, their meta-phorical parent."
9062,因为它们有共同的先，各种罗曼语是有谱系关系的。,"Because of their common ancestry, the Romance languages are genetically related."
9062,早期的英语和德语也是一样的，是同一祖语的方言，他们的共同祖语是原始日耳曼语。,"Early forms of English and German, too, were once dialects of a common ancestor called Proto Germanic."
9062,所谓原始语就是一组亲属语的共同祖语，这些语言都从它发展而来。,A protolanguage is the ancestral language from which related languages have developed.
9062,拉丁语和原始日耳曼语都是一个更古老的语言—印欧语或原始印欧语一一的后代。,Both Latin and Proto- Germanic were descendants of an older language called Indo-European or Proto-Indo-European.
9062,因此英语、德语等日耳曼语与法语、西班牙等罗曼语是有谱系关系的。,"Thus, Germanic languages such as English and German are genetically related to the Romance languages such as French and Spanish."
9062,所有这些重要的民族语，一度都只是地域方言而已。,All these national languages were once regional dialects.
9063,[j]是腭滑音，发音时舌叶（舌前部不包括舌尖）抬向硬腭，部位跟发beat[bit](打）中的元音i几乎相同。发you[ju](你）时舌头从[j]很快滑向元音[u]。,The glide [j] is a palatal sound; the blade of the tongue (the front part minus the tip) is raised toward the hard palate in a position almost identical to that in producing the vowel sound [i] in the word beat [bit].
9063,发滑音[w]时，舌后部抬向软腭，同时撮圆嘴唇。,The glide [w] is produced by both rounding the lips and simultaneously raising the back of the tongue toward the velum.
9063,因此它是一个圆唇软腭音（圆唇软腭滑音）。,It is thus a labio-velar glide.
9064,元音还可按嘴唇是否圆展来区别。,Vowels also differ as to whether the lips are rounded or spread.
9064,"boot(靴子），put(放），boat(小船），bore(钻孔）中的元音 [u]，[u],[o],[3]是圆唇元音，发音时圆唇或撮唇。","The back vowels [u], [ʊ], [o], and [ɔ] in boot, put, boat, and bore are the only rounded vowels in English.They are produced with pursed or rounded lips."
9064,"延长who这个词，就好像猫头鹰的叫声whoooooooooooo,你可以感觉到圆唇 。","You can get a feel for the rounding by prolonging the word who, as if you were an owl: whoooooooooo."
9065,两岁儿童的词库是不充分的。,The two-year-old has an insufficient lexicon.
9065,助动词的缺失，意味着她不能使用一个与形成英语问句相关的特定句法手段一一助动词移位。然而，她却有如何提出请求或询问信息的语用知识，并且有恰当的韵律，而这就需要懂得问句的音系和句法结构方面的知识。,"The lack of auxiliaries means that she cannot use a particular syntactic device associated with question formation in English—auxiliary movement.However, she has the pragmatic knowledge to make a request or ask for information, and she has the appropriate prosody, which depends on knowledge of phonology and the syntactic structure of the question."
9065,她也知道语法规则要求把wh-短语前置。,She also knows the grammatical rule that requires wh phrases to be in a fronted position.
9065,语言的许多部分都必须各就各位，才能构造出类似成人说的那种问句。,Many components of language must be in place to form an adultlike question.
9066,词语由一个或多个音节组成。,Words are composed of one or more syllables.
9066,音节是由一个或多个音位组成的音系单位。,A syllable is a phonological unit composed of one or more phonemes.
9066,每个音节都有一个音节核，即韵腹，通常是个元音（也可能是个成音节的流音或鼻音）。,"Every syllable has a nucleus, which is usually a vowel (but which may be a syllabic liquid or nasal)."
9066,在韵腹之前可以有一个或多个音位，称为声母；韵腹之后也可以跟着一个或多个音段，叫作韵尾。,The nucleus may be preceded and/or followed by one or more phonemes called the syllable onset and coda.
9066,儿童在很小的时候就会发现有些词是押韵的。,"From a very early age, children learn that certain words rhyme."
9066,两个押韵的词，其最后一个音节的韵腹和韵尾 都是相同的。正像下面顺口溜里的一样：     Jack and Jill(杰克和吉尔）Went up the hill(爬到山上）To fetch a pAn introduction to language of water(去提一桶水）Jack fell down(杰克摔倒了）And broke his crown(摔破了王冠）And Jill came tumbling after(吉尔跌跌撞撞跟在后面）由于这个原因，韵腹和韵尾共同组成韵体这一低于音节的单位。,"In rhyming words, the nucleus and the coda of the final syllable of both words are identical, as in the following jingle:Jack and JillWent up the hillTo fetch a pAn introduction to language of water.Jack fell downAnd broke his crownAnd Jill came tumbling after.For this reason, the nucleus + coda constitute the subsyllabic unit called a rime (note the spelling)."
9067,巴巴对殖民话语之间的这些形象或形象扮演的兴趣也明显地体现在他对巴赫金的“杂交”概念的借用与改造中。,Bhabha’s interest in these figures or figurings of the ‘in-between’ of colonial discourse is evident also in his invocation and transformation of the Bakhtinian notion of ‘hybridity’.
9067,在巴赫金的理论中，杂交的含义是使具有一个音调的权威形式不稳定起来。,"In Bakhtin, hybridization destabilizes univocal forms of authority."
9067,巴巴把杂交看作“对殖民再现的某种怀疑”，它“颠倒了殖民主义者否认(差异)的结果，这样就使另外那个‘被否定’的知识进入主流话语，从而疏离了主流话语的基础”。,"Bhabha sees hybridity as a ‘problematic of colonial representation’ which ‘reverses the effects of the colonialist disavowal [of difference], so that other “denied” knowledges enter upon the domin- ant discourse and estrange the basis of its authority’."
9068,严重的韦尼克失语症常常被称为杂乱性失语症。,Severe Wernicke’s aphasia is often referred to as jargon aphasia.
9068,布罗卡失语症患者和韦尼克失语症患者表现出来的语言缺陷，都指向人脑中语言的模块性组织。,The linguistic deficits exhibited by people with Broca’s and Wernicke’s aphasia point to a modular organization of language in the brain.
9068,我们发现不同脑部位的损伤造成的语言障碍类型是不同的（比如，是句法还是语义）。,"We find that damage to different parts of the brain results in different kinds of linguistic impairment (e.g., syntactic versus semantic)."
9068,这就为下面的假设提供了证据，即，如同人脑本身一样，心理语法并不是一个没有区别的系统，而是由具有不同功能的各不相同的单元或模块构成的。,"This supports the hypothesis that the mental grammar, like the brain itself, is not an undifferentiated system, but rather consists of distinct components or modules with different functions."
9069,大约在1630年，德国哲学家阿尔施泰德首次使用“ 一般语法” 这一术语， 以区别于“特殊语法”。,"In about 1630, the German philosopher Johann Heinrich Alsted first used the term general grammar as distinct from special grammar."
9069,他相信，一般语法的作用是揭示那些“与语法概念的方法和来源有关的特征。这些特征为一切语言所共有。”,He believed that the function of a general grammar was to reveal those features “which relate to the method and etiology of grammatical concepts. They are common to all languages.”
9070,后结构主义的修辞类型有不同的形式。,The rhetorical type of poststructuralism has taken various forms.
9070,在历史学（历史理论）中，海登·怀特（Hayden White） 就对著名历史学家的著作进行了激烈的解构。,"In historiography (the theory of history), Hayden White has attempted a radical deconstruction of the writings of well-known historians."
9070,在《话语修辞格》(1978)中，他争论说，历史学家相信 他们的叙述是 客观的，但因为叙述包含了结构，他们的叙述 就不可能避开文本性:“我们的话语总是倾向于从我们的材料滑向我们试 图用来把握这些材料的意识结构。”,"In Tropics of Discourse (1978) he argues that historians believe their narratives to be object- ive, but because it involves structure their narration cannot escape textuality: ‘Our discourse always tends to slip away from our data towards the structures of consciousness with which we are trying to grasp them.’"
9071,十分著名的论调随举几端，便证明我的断言持之有故。它们出自亚里士多德，朗吉努斯，贺拉斯，布瓦格，德莱顿，艾迪生，华兹华斯，何尔律治卡莱尔，马修阿诺德以及几位年代较晚的作家。,"A few specimens of the most famous utterances of Aristotle, Longinus, Horace, Boileau, Dryden, Addison, Wordsworth, Coleridge,  Carlyle,  Matthew  Arnold  and  some  more  modern authors,  will  justify  this  assertion."
9071,“所有的人都自然而然地从摹仿中获得快感。”“诗歌主要表述的是一般真理”，“它要求热情与疯狂相济为用；魂不附体时我们就化为想象的产物”，“美妙的文字乃是精神真正的光芒。”,‘All  men  naturally  receive pleasure  from  imitation.’‘Poetry  is  chieﬂy  conversant  about general  truth.’‘It  demands  an  enthusiasm  allied  to  madness; transported  out  of  ourselves  we  become  what  we  imagine.’ ‘Beautiful words are the very and peculiar light of the mind.’
9072,语言和脑紧密相连。,Language and the brain are intimately connected.
9072,脑的一些特定区域专司语言，若这些区域受损，就会使语言陷入混乱。,"Specific areas of the brain are devoted to language, and injury to these areas disrupts language."
9072,幼儿的大脑左半球受伤或被切除，会对其语言发展产生严重的影响。,"In the young child, injury to or removal of the left hemisphere has severe consequences for language development."
9072,反之，越来越多的证据表明，脑的正常发育，取决于早期与语言的正常接触。,"Conversely, increasing evidence shows that normal brain development depends on early and regular exposure to language."
9073,历史上对失语症的记载表明，长期以来人们一直被脑与语言之间的关联深深吸引。,The historical descriptions of aphasia illustrate that people have long been fascinated by the brain-language connection.
9073,现在我们不再需要通过外科手术或尸体解剖来定位脑损部位，或确认人脑中的语言区域。,Today we no longer need to rely on surgery or autopsy to locate brain lesions or to identify the language regions of the brain.
9073,现代无创性人脑直接成像技术，比如计算机断层成像（CT) 技术和磁共振成像（MRI)技术，都能在伤害发生后不久，就揭示出活体人脑中的损伤部位。,Noninvasive brain recording technologies such as computer tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can reveal lesions in the living brain shortly after the damage occurs.
9073,除此之外，正电子发射断层成像（PET) 扫描和功能性磁共振成像（fMRI)扫描，还能够提供人脑的活动影像。,"In addition, positron emission tomography (PET) scans, functional MRI (fMRI) scans, and single photon emission CT (Structuralist poetics : structuralism, linguistics and the study of literature ECT) scans provide images of the brain in action."
9073,所以现在可以检测脑活动的变化，并将这些变化与脑的损伤部位及其认知任务联系起来。,It is now possible to detect changes in brain activity and to relate these changes to localized brain damage and specific linguistic and nonlinguistic cognitive tasks.
9074,最后，我们还应该注意到20世纪中期美国的另一个文学“运动”，这个运动在小说研究中特别有影响，即由所谓的“新亚里士多德主义者”们组成的芝加哥学派。,"Finally, we should notice another American ‘movement’ of the mid-twentieth century which was especially influential in the study of fiction: the so-called ‘Chicago School’ of ‘Neo-Aristotelians’."
9074,从30年代末期到40、50年代，新亚里士多德主义者们聚集在芝加哥大学，以R.S.克兰为核心，从理论上对新批评家们提出挑战，但事实上他们的形式结构分析和信仰却常常被看作新批评的一个“异端”而己。他们像艾略特一样，相信批评应该研究“作为诗歌的诗歌，而不是别的东西”。,"Theoretically offering a challenge to the New Critics but in fact often seen as only a New Critical‘heresy’ in their analysis of formal structure and in their belief, with T. S. Eliot, that criticism should study ‘poetry as poetry and not another thing’, the Neo-Aristotelians were centred, from the later 1930s through the 1940s and 1950s, on R. S. Crane at the University of Chicago."
9075,在这个讲座时过程中，我已经提到与语言结构有关的一些经典观念，以及当代对这些观念所做的深化和扩展的努力。,In the course of these lectures I have mentioned some of the classical ideas regarding language structure and contemporary efforts to deepen and extend them.
9075,看来很清楚，我们必须把语言能力——一种语言的知识——当作是在行为底下的一个抽象系统，一种通过其相互作用来决定无数个可能的句子的形式和内在意义的规则构成的系统。,"It seems clear that we must regard linguistic competence – knowledge of a language – as an abstract system underlying behavior, a system constituted by rules that interact to determine the form and intrinsic meaning of a potentially infinite number of sentences."
9075,这样一个系统—— 即一种生成语法——为洪堡特学派的“语言的形式”的观念提供了一种阐释。在他死后出版的伟大著作《超越人类语言的差异》中的一段含糊但却有暗示意义的话里，洪堡特把“语言形式”定义为“在 心理动作底层的、恒常不变的过程的系统，这种心理动作把有结构地组织连接好的信号提升为一种对思想的表达”。,"Such a system – a generative grammar – provides an explication of the Humboldtian idea of “form of language,” which in an obscure but suggestive remark in his great posthumous work, Uber die Verschiedenheit des Menschlichen Sprachbaues, Humboldt defines as “that constant and unvarying system of processes underlying the mental act of raising articulated structurally organized signals to an expression of thought.”"
9076,在讨论树形图时，可以说每一个更高的节点统制着下面所有的范畴。,"In discussing trees, every higher node is said to dominate all the categories beneath it."
9076,S统制任一节点。,S dominates every node.
9076,可以说一个节点直接统制下一级的范畴。,A node is said to immediately dominate the categories one level below it.
9076,"VP统制V和NP,还统制Det和N。VP直接统制V和NP,也就是组成VP的范畴。","VP immediately dominates V and NP, the categories of which it is composed."
9076,直接被同一节点所统制的范畴是姐妹。,Categories that are immediately dominated by the same node are sisters.
9077,那些探索者凭借理性，凭借长于取舍的直觉和在所不辞的论辩，未掌握必要的事实依据就坐下来思考问题。他们至少彻底让人看到其方法不足凭信。不过倘若没有他们的辛勤努力，大家就不大会怀疑这种现已证明是一无可取的方法。,"Select Intuition and the Ineluctable Argument, who have sat down without the necessary facts to think the matter out, have at least thoroughly discredited a method which apart from their labours would hardly have been suspected of the barrenness it has shown."
9077,而那些效法费希纳的人则转向具体、特殊事实依据的收集分析和经验主义的美学研究，他们为心理学提供了大批详细资料。,"And those who, following Fechner, have turned instead to the collection and analysis of concrete, particular facts and to empirical research into aesthetics have supplied a host of details to psychology."
9078,然而，虚构的语境对故事到底要说明什么意义这个问题总是不做明确答复。,"The context of fiction, though, explicitly leaves open the question of what the fiction is really about."
9078,指代现实世界与诠释赋予它的功能相比就算不上什么文学作品的特性了。,Reference to the world is not so much a property of literary works as a function they are given by interpretation.
9078,如果我对一位朋友说：“请明天晚上8点钟到大岩石餐馆来和我一起吃晚饭。”她或者他会把这句话作为一个实实在在的邀请，并且从该话的语境中判断出具体的时间和 地点（“明天”指1998年1月14日，“8”点指东部标准时间晚上8点钟)。,"If I tell a friend, ‘Meet me for dinner at the Hard Rock Café at eight tomorrow,’ he or she will take this as a concrete invitation and identify spatial and temporal referents from the context of utterance (‘tomorrow’ means 14 January 2002, ‘eight’ mean 8 p.m.Eastern Standard Time)."
9079,该图解说明，一个XP包含一个指定语，这本质上是一个修饰语（而且通常都是非强制性成分)，还包含一个X’。,"The first level is the XP itself.The second level consists of a specifier, which functions as a modifier (and which is generally an optional constituent), and an X' (i."
9079,例如，一个NP的指定语是限定词，而一个VP的指定语是诸如never或者often这样的副词，一个AdjP的指定语是一个表示程度的词，例如very或quite。,"e.,“X-bar”).For example, an NP specifier is a determiner; a VP specifier is an adverb such as never or often; an AdjP specifier is a degree word such as very or quite."
9079,任何X’都是由一个中心语X和一个补足语构成，补足语可以是短语范畴，因此这会导致出现递归。,"The third level is an expansion of X' and consists of a head X and a complement, which may itself be a phrasal category, thus giving rise to recursion."
9080,这些例子说明的是人称直指。,These examples illustrate person deixis.
9080,它们还表明，像this和that这样的指示冠词也是直指的。,They also show that the demonstrative articles like this and that are deictic.
9080,此外，还有时间直指和地点直指。,We also have time deixis and place deixis.
9081,"所谓的指示性词，与讲话环境相关的语言的定位特点，比如代词（我、你）,或者表示时间、地点的副词（这里、那里、现在、那时、昨天、今天）在文学中都有特殊的功能。","Deictics, as they are called, orientational features of language that relate to the situation of utterance, such as pronouns (I, you) or adverbials of place and time (here, there, now, then, yesterday, tomorrow), function in special ways in literature."
9081,比如此时这个词在一句诗里(“此时……飞到一起的燕子在空中啁啾”），它指的并不是诗人第一次写下这个词的那个时刻，也不是指这首诗第一次出版的那个时刻，而是指诗中的某一时刻，指它的活动所表现的那个虚构世界中的某一刻。,"Now in a poem (‘now . . . gathering swallows twitter in the skies’) refers not to the instant when the poet first wrote down that word, or to the moment of first publication, but to a time in the poem, in the fictional world of its action."
9081,再看，如果“我”这个字在一首抒情诗中出现，比如华兹华斯的诗句“我漫无目的地飘着，像一朵孤独的云……”这个“我”也是虚构的。它指的是诗中的叙述人。这个人也许与实际生活中的诗作者华兹华斯截然不同。,"And the ‘I’ that appears in a lyric poem, such as Wordsworth’s ‘I wandered lonely as a cloud . . .’, is also fictional; it refers to the speaker of the poem, who may be quite different from the empirical individual, William Wordsworth, who wrote the poem."
9081,（诗里的陈述人或者叙述者的经历与华兹华斯一生中某个时刻的经历也许会有不可摆脱的关联，但是，在一位老者的诗篇中，完全可能出现一位年轻的陈述人，反之亦然。而且，小说中的叙述者，那些在讲述故事时以“我”自称的角色完全可能与故事的作者有着截然不同的经历，并且做出截然相反的判断，这也是众所周知的。）,"(There may well be strong connections between what happens to the speaker or narrator of the poem and what happened to Wordsworth at some moment in his life. But a poem written by an old man may have a young speaker and vice versa. And, notoriously, the narrators of novels, the characters who say ‘I’ as they recount the story, may have experiences and make judgements that are quite different from those of their authors.)"
9082,“众声喧哗”(heteroglossia)是这派的一个基本概念，巴赫金在其《小说中的话语》(写于1934—1935年间)中对这一概念做了最清晰的界定。,"‘Heteroglossia’ is a fundamental concept, most clearly defined in Bakhtin’s ‘Discourse in the Novel’ (written 1934–5)."
9082,这个概念指所有话语中制约意义生产的根本条件。,The term refers to the basic condition governing the production of meaning in all discourse.
9082,它肯定了语境限定声音表达意义的方式，声音表达是众语喧哗的，它使得各种社会声音及其单一表达的多样性发生作用。,"It asserts the way in which context defines the meaning of utterances, which are heteroglot in so far as they put in play a multiplicity of social voices and their individual expressions."
9083,世界上的多种语言都含有丰富多样的屈折变化过程。,Among the world’s languages is a richness and variety of inflectional processes.
9083,"在上文, 我们看到德语中如何通过附加环缀对动词词干实现了屈折变化，使其变成过去分词：从lieb 到 geliebt, 这类似于英语的后缀-ed。","Earlier we saw how German uses circumfixes to inflect a verb stem to produce a past particle: lieb to geliebt, similar to the -ed ending of English."
9083,"阿拉伯语里用于屈折变化的中缀元音: kitáab 是""book""（书）， 但 kútub 是""books""（书的复数）。",Arabic infixes vowels for inflectional purposes: kitáab “book” but kútub “books.”
9083,"萨摩亚语 (参见练习 10) 使用重叠的过程-通过重复某个词语的部分或整个词语而进行屈折变化：savali 是""他旅行"", 但 savavali是 “他们旅行”。","Samoan (see exercise 10) uses a process of reduplication—inflecting a word through the repetition of part or all of the wordː savali “he travels,” but savavali “they travel.”"
9083,马来人重复整个词语ː orang 是“person”（一个人）但 orang orang 是“people”（人们）。,"Malay does the same with whole wordsː orang “person,” but orang orang “people.”"
9084,主动句说的是有关水獭的一般性行为，而且是真的。被动句说的是有关水坝的某些一般性情形，而正好是错的(因为有些水坝，如Grand Coulee Dam就不是水獭建的)。,"The active sentence is saying something about beavers in general, and happens to be true; the passive sentence is saying something about dams in general, and happens to be false (since some dams, like the Grand Coulee Dam, are not built by beavers)."
9084,这个表层结构把水坝放在句子的主语的位置上，但是却把它联到动词短语里原来的位置上，这个痕迹使得你可以讨了便宜又卖乖。,"The surface structure, which puts dams in the sentence's subject position but links it to a trace of its original verb phrase position, allows the cake to be both eaten and had."
9085,主动句说的是有关水獭的一般性行为，而且是真的。被动句说的是有关水坝的某些一般性情形，而正好是错的(因为有些水坝，如Grand Coulee Dam就不是水獭建的)。,"The active sentence is saying something about beavers in general, and happens to be true; the passive sentence is saying something about dams in general, and happens to be false (since some dams, like the Grand Coulee Dam, are not built by beavers)."
9085,这个表层结构把水坝放在句子的主语的位置上，但是却把它联到动词短语里原来的位置上，这个痕迹使得你可以讨了便宜又卖乖。,"The surface structure, which puts dams in the sentence's subject position but links it to a trace of its original verb phrase position, allows the cake to be both eaten and had."
9086,如果说现象学一方面保卫了一个可知世界的安全，那么它另一方面则确立了主体的中心地位。,"If phenomenology secured a knowable world with one hand, it established the centrality of the human subject with the other."
9086,的确，它所允诺的正是关于主观性本身的科学。,Indeed it promised nothing less than a science of subjectivity itself.
9086,世界是我所假定或者“意欲”的东西，它应作为我的意识的相关物，在与我的关系中加以把握，而这一意识不是经验的而是超验的。,"The world is what I posit or 'intend': it is to be grasped in relation to me, as a correlate of my consciousness, and that consciousness is not just fallibly empirical but transcendental."
9086,这是一种确有把握的事——认识自己。,This was a reassuring sort of thing to learn about oneself.
9087,这一错误阐释的出现，原因就在于混淆了对仗的本质与对仗的功能。,This mistaken interpretation arises from a confusion about the nature and function of parallelism.
9087,读者并不孤立地考虑这首十四行诗的语法结构，并不将它置于主宰一切的位置。,"The reader does not consider the grammatical structure of the sonnet in isolation, allowing it to override all other considerations."
9087,他把句法特点与其他特点联系在一起考虑，然后找出“to make the taker mad”与“leads men to this hell”之间在主题和语法结构方面的平行关系：后者是前者的一般化的说法。,He takes in syntactic features together with other features and thus will ﬁnd an obvious thematic and grammatical parallel between 'to make the taker mad' and 'leads men to this hell': the second is a generalized version of the ﬁrst.
9088,Will这个字是助词的一个例子，表达说话人对命题真伪看法的一个意义层面。,"The word “will” is an example of an auxiliary, a word that expresses layers of meaning having to do with the truth of a proposition as the speaker conceives it."
9088,这个层面述包括否定的(如 won'and doesn't)、必要的和可能的。,"These layers also include negation (as in won't and doesn 't) , necessity (must) , and possibility (might and can) ."
9088,助词通常是在句子树形图的外围，显示出它对整个句子的声明。,"Auxiliaries typically occur at the periphery of sentence trees, mirroring the fact that they assert something about the rest of the sentence taken as a whole."
9089,这些儿童并无其他认知缺陷，他们既没有患孤独症也不是智力低下，也没有知觉上的问题。,"They show no other cognitive deficits, they are not autistic or retarded, and they have no perceptual problems."
9089,这样的儿童患有专门性语言障碍（SThe language instinct : how the mind creates language)。,Such children are suffering from specific language impairment(SThe language instinct : how the mind creates language).
9089,只有他们的语言能力受到了影响，通常只是语法的某些特定部分有障碍。,"Only their linguistic ability is affected, and often only specific aspects of grammar are impaired."
9090,实际上，每种可理解的科学、行业、贸易和职业都有自己的一套词汇，依据使用这些“时髦”词语的人的身份，其中一些词汇被认为是俚语，而另外一些则是技术术语。这样的词汇有时被称为行话或专门语。,"Practically every conceivable science, profession, trade, and occupation uses specific slang terms called jargon, or argot."
9090,语言学的行话是由“音位、词位、格、词库、短语结构规则”等术语组成的。,"Linguistic jargon, some of which is used in this book, consists of terms such as phoneme, morpheme, case, lexicon, phrase structure rule, and so on."
9091,在句子“杰克游泳”中，我们知道“杰克”一词通常被称为专有名词，指的是世界上一件具体的东西，这就是它的指称。,"In the sentence Jack swims, we know that the word Jack, which is a proper name, refers to a precise object in the world, which is its referent."
9091,比如说，在上文给出的情景中，“杰克”的指称意义是你的一个朋友，他现在正很高兴地在游泳池里游泳。,"For instance, in the scenario given earlier, the referential meaning of Jack is the guy who is your friend and who is swimming happily in the pool right now."
9091,由此我们知道“杰克”这个名字的意义是它所指的某一个体。,"Based on this, we conclude that the meaning of the name Jack is the individual it refers to."
9092,近年来，结构主义者对转化语法表示出越来越浓厚的兴趣的原因之一是他们觉得它比较“充满活力”。,One factor that has tempted structuralists in recent years to shift their allegiance to transformational grammar is the notion that it is more‘dynamic’.
9092,结构主义语言学是分析性的，它把语序简化为各个构造成分，而乔姆斯基的模式则被认为是综合性的，再现了说话者实际发出的言语（新的和旧的）：“从理论基础来看，生成语法较分析语言的方法有其优点，它能引出一种综合的观点，这种观点把说话行为看作是一个生成过程。”,"Whereas structural linguistics was analytic and reduced a given sequence to its constituents, Chomsky’s model is thought to be synthetic and to represent the actual production of utterances (new and old) by a speaker:‘generative grammar has, in its theoretical foundations, the advantage over analytic approaches to language, of introducing a synthetic point of view which presents the act of speech as a generative process’."
9093,使语言本质上具有保守性的能指和所指关系的这种随意性，也能用来保证系统的“结构”本质，这种随意性恰好是按皮亚杰所描述的情况发生的。,The very arbitrariness of the relationship between signifier and signified that makes language conservative in nature also serves to guarantee the ‘structural’ nature of the system in which it occurs in precisely the terms put forward by Piaget.
9093,语言是自我界定的，因此，语言是完整无缺的。,"Language is self-defining, and so whole and complete."
9093,它是能“转换”的过程，即自身能产生新的方面(新的句子）以对新的经验作出反应。,"It is capable of a process of ‘transformation’: that is, of generating new aspects of itself (new sentences) in response to new experience."
9094,让·皮亚杰给这个概念下的定义，是一项最有成果的尝试。,One of the most fruitful attempts at a definition has been made by Jean Piaget.
9094,皮亚杰认为，人们可以在一些实体的排列组合中观察到结构，这种排列组合体现下列基本概念：(a)整体性概念；（b）转换概念；(c)自我调节概念。,"Structure, he argues, can be observed in an arrangement of entities which embodies the following fundamental ideas:(a) the idea of wholeness;(b) the idea of transformation;(c) the idea of self-regulation."
9094,所谓整体性，是指内在的连贯性。,By wholeness it means the sense of internal coherence.
9095,一部颇具影响的美国巨著《文化研究》的导言指出：“尽管在文化研究中没有明令禁止对文本的仔细解读，但它们也不是非做不可的。,"The introduction to an influential American volume, Cultural Studies, declares, ‘although there is no prohibition against close textual readings in cultural studies, they are also not required’."
9095,”没有明今禁止仔细解读并不能令文学批评家们感到安慰。,
9095,摆脱了长期以来控制文学研究的原则，即文学研究关注的要点是每一部作品与众不同的错综性，文化研究很容易变成-种非量化的社会学，把作品当作反映作品之外事物的实例或者表象來对待，而不对作品本身感兴趣，这样很容易被其他诱惑所摆布。,"This assurance that close reading is not prohibited is scarcely reassuring to the literary critic.Freed from the principle that has long governed literary studies–that the main point of interest is the distinctive complexity of individual works-cultural studies could easily become a kind of non-quantitative sociology, treating works as instances or symptoms of something else rather than of interest in themselves, and succumbing to other temptations."
9096,这种字串机器的学名叫做“有限情境”或是“马克夫模式”，是一堆字串(事先做好的短语)以及如何从字串到另一字串行走方向的指标。,"Let's call this a word-chain device (the technical name is a ""finitestate"" or ""Markov"" model.) A word-chain device is a bunch of lists of words (or prefabricated phrases) and a set of directions for going from list to list."
9096,—个处理者可以从一个字串中挑一个字，再从另一个字串中挑一个字，再从另一个字串中挑一个字......综合成一个句子。,"A processor builds a sentence by selecting a word from one list, then a word from another list, and so on."
9096,字串系统常被作家如怫任等人用来讽刺写作如食谱一般，照本宣科，弄出一堆冗赘的句子来。,Word chain systems are commonly used in satires like Raryn's usually as do-it-yourself recipes for composing examples of a kind of verbiage.
9097,对于那些寻求使用更为数学化的公式来表示基本过程的人来说，被公认形成于50年代前期的关于通讯的数学理论为其提供了一个基本概念，即信息。信息概念能把社会科学和行为科学结合起来，并在概率的基础上，为人的行为提供一个可靠的、令人满意的数学理论。,"For those who sought a more mathematical formulation of the basic processes, there was the newly developed mathematical theory of communication, which, it was widely believed in the early 1950s, had provided a fundamental concept—the concept of “information” that would unify the social and behavioral sciences and permit the development of a solid and satisfactory mathematical theory of human behavior on a probabilistic base."
9097,大约与此同时，作为一项独立研究的自动机理论也发展起来了，使用的也是与信息论密切相关的数学概念。,"At about the same time, the theory of automata developed as an independent study, making use of closely related mathematical notions."
9097,这又迅速且适当地与早期的中枢神经网络的探索联在一起。,"And it was linked at once, and quite properly, to earlier explorations of the theory of neural nets."
9098,有些词是它们自己的反义词。,Some words are their own antonyms.
9098,这些“自反义词”是这样一些词：例如cleave（切开/黏住）和dust（擦掸/撒扬），后者可分别用在dusting furniture（擦拭/掸除家具上的灰尘）和dusting crops（扬谷）。,"These “autoantonyms” or “contranyms” are words such as cleave “to split apart” or “to cling together” and dust “to remove something” or “to spread something,” as in dusting furniture or dusting crops."
9098,拼写不同但是发音一样的反义词对和自反义词类似：raise（种植，喂养，募集）和raze（拆毁，抹除）就是这样一个词对。,Antonymic pairs that are pronounced the same but spelled differently are similar to autoantonyms: raise and raze are one such pair.
9099,音系规则一般应用于语音的自然类。,Phonological rules often apply to natural classes of sounds.
9099,"自然类是指一组被少数区别特征所描述的音，例如/p/，/t/,/k/和/tʃ/可以被[-带声]和[-通]所描写。","A natural class is a group of sounds described by a small number of distinctive features such as [–voiced], [–continuant], which describe /p/, /t/, /k/, and /tʃ/."
9099,区别该类中任一成员都需要比定义该类更多的特征， 因此/p/不但是[-带声]和[-通] ，还得有[+唇]。,"Any individual member of a natural class would require more features in its description than the class itself, so /p/ is not only [–voiced], [–continuant], but also [+labial]."
9100,它们具有诗歌艺术的想像和理解特性。,They bear on the operations of poetic imagination and poetic interpretation.
9100,于是我们碰到了现代理论界的一个重要观点，文学的“自我折射性”(Self - reflexivity)。,Here we encounter another notion that has been important in recent theory: that of the ‘self-reflexivity’ of literature.
9100,小说在某种程度上是关于多部小说的作品，是关于再现和塑造，或者赋予经验意义的作品。,"Novels are at some level about novels, about the problems and possibilities of representing and giving shape or meaning to experience."
9101,这看起来似乎是在很短的时间内完成大量的工作:我们能以每秒20个音位的速度来理解口语。,This seems like a great deal of work to be done in a very short time: we can understand spoken language at a rate of twenty phonemes per second.
9101,也许有人会断定必定存在某种诀窍这一切才有可能发生。,One might conclude that there must be some sort of a trick that makes it all possible.
9101,从某种意义上来说确实有诀窍。,In a certain sense there is.
9101,由于语言的序列性特征，在线理解过程中总会涉及一定的猜测。,"Because of the sequential nature of language, a certain amount of guesswork is involved in real-time comprehension."
9101,许多心理语言学家提出语言的知觉和理解不仅涉及自下而上处理，而且还涉及自上而下处理。,Many psycholinguists suggest that language perception and comprehension involve both top-down processing and bottom-up processing.
9102,也许有人会断定必定存在某种诀窍这一切才有可能发生。,One might conclude that there must be some sort of a trick that makes it all possible.
9102,从某种意义上来说确实有诀窍。,In a certain sense there is.
9102,由于语言的序列性特征，在线理解过程中总会涉及一定的猜测。,"Because of the sequential nature of language, a certain amount of guesswork is involved in real-time comprehension."
9102,许多心理语言学家提出语言的知觉和理解不仅涉及自下而上处理，而且还涉及自上而下处理。,Many psycholinguists suggest that language perception and comprehension involve both topdown processing and bottom-up processing.
9103,这种观点明显和功利主义有着密切关系。,This  view  plainly  has  close  connections  with  Utilitarianism.
9103,其实边沁著怍的编者对其大师学说的解释倘若可以确信的话，那么这就是边沁要传授的思想，“和快乐最近于同义的名词‘自愿’：凡事做了令人快乐，无非是人愿意做的事……。,"In  fact  if Bentham’s editor is to be trusted in his interpretation of his master’s doctrine, it  would  be  what  Bentham  intended  to  teach.‘The  term  nearest  to  being synonymous with pleasure is volition: what it pleases a man to do is simply what he wills to do."
9103,"人所愿意做的事悄,或者人所乐而为之的事情，可能远远没有给他带来乐趣，不过我们可不可以说人在做的时候并非自得其乐呢？",". . . What a man wills to do, or what he pleases to do, may be far from giving him enjoyment; yet shall we say that in doing it, he is not following his own pleasure?"
9104,名词用格来标示，用动词或其他述语在心理词汇中的特征来指定角色的意义。,Nouns are marked for case and assigned semantic roles by the mental dictionary entry of the verb or other predicate.
9104,短语可以从深层结构中移出，留下一个空隙或语迹，使它可以形成问句、相关子句、被动句及其他的架构。,"Phrases can be moved from their deep-structure positions, leaving a gap or ''trace,"" by a structure-dependent movement rule, thereby forming questions, relative clauses, passives, and other widespread constructions."
9104,新的字可以依照衍生和字形变化的规则来创造或修饰，语尾变化的规则最主要是标示名词的格的数量，标示动词的时式、时态、语气、声音和否定，以及使主词和受词在数量、性别还有人称上相对应。,"New word structures can be created and modified by derivational and inflectional rules.Inflectional rules primarily mark nouns for case and number, and mark verbs for tense, aspect, mood, voice, negation, and agreement with subjects and objects in number, gender, and person."
9105,对于维多利亚时代的统治阶级来说，这是非常令人担忧的，因为从任何理由来说，宗教都是一种极其有效的意识形态控制方式。,"This was particularly worrying for the Victorian ruling class, because religion is for all kinds of reasons an extremely effective form of ideological control."
9105,像一切成功的意识形态一样，宗教活动依靠的主要不是明确的概念或系统的学说，而是意象、象征、习惯、仪式和神话。,"Like all successful ideologies, it works much less by explicit concepts or formulated doctrines than by image, symbol, habit, ritual and mythology."
9105,它是情绪的和经验的，因而能使自己与人类主体的最深的潜意识之根缠结在一起；任何一种社会意识形态，如果它不能与这种深刻的、非理性的恐惧和需要相契合——就艾略特(T.S.Eliot) 所了解的那样——它就不可能长存久在。,"It is affective and experiential, entwining itself with the deepest unconscious roots of the human subject; and any social ideology which is unable to engage with such deepseated a-rational fears and needs, as T. S. Eliot knew, is unlikely to survive very long."
9106,关于文学性的解释，不论着重于突出，还是着重于语言综合，都没有提出测试的标准，凭着这个标准，哪怕是火星人也能把文学与其他写作类别区别开来。,"Accounts of literariness focused on the foregrounding or on the integration of language don’t provide tests by which, say, Martians could separate works of literature from other sorts of writing."
9106,同大多数关于文学性质的声明一样，这些解释的作用也只是把注意力引向文学的某个方面，引向他们认为是文学核心的那个方面。,"Such accounts function, like most claims about the nature of literature, to direct attention to certain aspects of literature which they claim to be central."
9106,这一点告诉我们，要把什么东西作为文学进行研究，首先要研究它的语言结构，而不要把它当成作者的自我表述，或是促成它产生的那个社会的写照进行解读。,"To study something as literature, this account tells us, is to look above all at the organization of its language, not to read it as the expression of its author's psyche or as the reflection of the society that produced it."
9107,汉语和日语的文字系统是两大例外。,The major exceptions are the writing systems used in China and Japan.
9107,汉字有三千五百多年不曾中断的历史。,"The Chinese writing system has an uninterrupted history of 3,500 years."
9107,它主要是词语文字，每个语符（字）代表一个单个的词或语素。,"For the most part it is a word-writing system, each character representing an individual word or morpheme."
9107,两个词或语素可以组成更长的词，如表示“生意”的“买卖”由“买”和“卖”这两个词组成。,"Longer words are formed by combining two words or morphemes, as shown by the word meaning “business,” mǎimai, which is formed by combining the words meaning “buy” and “sell.”"
9108,这两个句子都是清晰的，并且只能当作其潜在句子进行解读，其中的斜体短语并非另一个名词短语的一部分。,Each of these is unambiguous and can have only the interpretation of the underlying sentence in which the italicized phrase is not part of another noun phrase.
9108,例46中的关系从句也是如此。这些事实也都可以由A-over-A原理来解释。,"The same is true of the relatives formed from 46, and these facts too would be explained by the A-over-A principle."
9108,类似的例子还有很多。,There are many similarexamples.
9109,十九世纪文学批评的主要指向从欣赏者转向了作者，而从古代修辞学家朗吉努斯身上，也可看出类似于这一更替现象的倾向，浪漫主义理论的许多特有成分都源自他的理论。,Something approaching the nineteenth century displacement of the audience by the author as the focal term of reference is to be found in one classical rhetoricianj Longinus—the exemplar and source Of many characteristic elements of romantic theory.
9109,当然，他那篇论文并不是专门论诗的，也没有涉及一篇完整的诗歌，而只谈了“崇高”这一特征，而这种崇高正是“最伟大的诗人和作家获取成功”所依赖的主要优点。,"His treatise, of course, was not concerned specifically with poetry, nor with any poem in its entirety, but only with the one quality of the 'sublime,'that cardinal excellence from which 'the greatest poets and writers have derived their eminence.'"
9109,他在探讨崇高特性的过程中，跨越了传统的文体分野，也打破了韵文与散文的界限；崇高存在于荷马、德谟斯提尼、柏拉图、《创世纪》，以及萨福的一首抒情诗之中。,"His pursuit of is quality cuts across the conventional divisions of discourse as well as the boundary between verse and prose; sublimity is to be found in Horner, Demosthenes, Plato, the Book of Genesis, and a love-lyric of Sappho."
9110,《如是》派的成员无论为自己赢得了什么样的自由，它都必须建立在约定俗成的程式之上，都必须包括一套阐释程序。,Whatever type of freedom the members of the Tel Quel group secure for themselves will be based on convention and will consist of a set of interpretive procedures.
9110,产生意义与人为地分派意义，合乎情理的发展与随意联想，有着重要的区别。,"There is a crucial difference between the production of meaning and arbitrary assignment of meaning, between plausible development and random association."
9110,他们追求的是前者而不是后者，他们不想承认自己的分析比任何其他的分析逊色，在这个意义上，他们仍然致力于在程式的范围内活动。,They seek the former rather than the latter – they would not want to claim that their analyses are no better than any other – and to that extent are committed to working within conventions.
9111,由于一个诗人浑然忘我于永恒和太一之中。所以在他的概念中无所谓时间、空间和数量。,"Since a poet participates in the eternal and the one, as far as relates to his conceptions, time and place and number are not."
9111,表示时间的不同，人称的差异、空间的悬殊等等的语法形式，应用于最高级的诗中，都可以炅活运用，而丝毫无损于诗本身；埃斯库罗斯的合唱曲，《约伯记》，但丁《神曲》中的《天堂篇》，都比其它作品提供了更多关于这一事实的例证，可惜本文限于篇幅，不容我引证。,"The grammatical forms which express the moods of time, and the difference of persons, and the distinction of place, are convertible with respect to the highest poetry without injuring it as poetry; and the choruses of Aeschylus, and the book of Job, and Dante's Paradise, would afford, more than any other writings, examples of this fact, if the limits of this essay did not forbid cicadon."
9111,雕塑、绘画和音乐的创作，则是更加明确的例子了。,"The creations of sculp¬ture, painting, and music, are illustrations still more decisive."
9112,霸主权即一种由被控制者接受的统治格局。,Hegemony is an arrangement of domination accepted by those who are dominated.
9112,统治集团并不是纯粹通过武力去统治一切，而是通过一种协调的社会结构，文化正是这种结构中的一部分，它使当今的社会组合合法化。,"Ruling groups dominate not by pure force but through a structure of consent, and culture is part of this structure that legitimizes current social arrangements."
9112,﹝这是出自意大利马克思主义理论家安东尼奥·葛兰西的观点。﹞,(The concept comes from the Italian Marxist theorist Antonio Gramsci.)
9113,直到最近，才有报道说许多这类白痴天才在语言方面都有缺陷。,"Until recently, most such savants have been reported to be linguistically handicapped."
9113,他们可能擅长模仿，能够像鹦鹉那样重复别人说的话，然而他们的创造性语言能力却很匮乏。,"They may be good mimics who can repeat speech like parrots, but they show meager creative language ability."
9113,不过有文献报道了一些语言白痴天才的案例，他们习得了自己语言中高度复杂的语法（有些还习得了其他语言的语法），然而却缺乏同等复杂程度的非语言能力。,"Nevertheless, the literature reports cases of language savants who have acquired the highly complex grammar of their language (as well as other languages in some cases) but who lack nonlinguistic abilities of equal complexity."
9114,“宝贝儿语”是一个术语，用来标示许多成年人跟儿童说话时所用的词的形式。,Baby talk is a term used to label the word forms that many adults use when speaking to children.
9114,英语中的例子有用choo-choo表示“火车”，用bow-wow表示“狗”。,Examples in English are choo-choo for “train” and bow-wow for “dog.”
9114,每种语言和文化中似乎都有宝贝儿语。,Baby talk seems to exist in every language and culture.
9114,对于宝贝儿语来说，有两点似乎具有普遍性，即具有宝贝儿语形式的词都属于某些语义范畴（比如食物和动物），这些词的语音要比相应的成人形式简单一些（比如，用tummy/tʌmi/“肚皮”表示stomach/stʌmik/“肚子”)。,"At least two things seem to be universal about baby talk: The words that have baby-talk forms fall into certain semantic categories (e.g., food and animals), and the words are phonetically simpler than the adult forms (e.g."
9114,,", “tummy” /tʌmi/ for “stomach” /stʌmɪk/)."
9115,然而，没有体裁理论的世界是不可思议的，于经验也不相符合。,"Nevertheless, a world without a theory of genre is unthinkable, and untrue to experience."
9115,我们可以区别喜剧和悲剧，即使这些术语不如我们希望的那样精确和独特。,"We can tell the difference between a comedy and a tragedy, even if those terms are not as precise and as exclusive as we might wish them to be."
9115,托多罗夫说，如果没有这种理论，“我们仍然是世代相传的偏见的囚徒”。,"Without such a theory, as Todorov says, ‘we remain the prisoners of prejudices transmitted from century to century’."
9116,"在动词短语的层次——这个谁对谁做了什么的层次——名同所扮演的角色在两个句子中楚一样的，水獭是建水坝的“人”,水坝是被建的东西，但是在IP句子的层次上——这是一个上语一述词关系的层次，一个所宣称的是否正确的层次——名词所扮演的角色是不同的。","Down in the verb phrase--the level of who did what to whom--the nouns are playing the same roles in both sentences.Beavers do the building, dams get built.But up at the sentence (IP) level--the level of subject-predicate relations, of what is being asserted to be true of what--they are playing different roles."
9116,"主动句说的是有关水獺的一般性行为，而且是真的。被动句说的是有关水坝的某些一般性情形,而正好是错的（因为有些水坝，Grand Coulee Dam就不是水獭建的)。","The active sentence is saying something about beavers in general, and happens to be true; the passive sentence is saying something about dams in general, and happens to be false (since some dams, like the Grand Coulee Dam, are not built by beavers)."
9117,意义不像赫希所设想的那么稳定和明确，即便作者的意义也是一样。它们所以不然的理由是——尽管他不会承认——意义是语言的产物，而这种东西总是让人有些捉摸不定的地方。,"Meanings are not as stable and determinate as Hirsch thinks, even authorial ones — and the reason they are not is because, as he will not recognize, they are the products of language, which always has something slippery about it."
9117,要想知道什么可以叫做拥有一个“纯粹”意图或表达一个“纯粹”意义是很困难的：仅仅是由于赫希把意义从语言那里拿开，他才能信赖这样一些怪物。,It is difficult to know what it could be to have a 'pure' intention or express a 'pure' meaning; it is only because Hirsch holds meaning apart from language that he is able to trust to such chimeras.
9117,作者的意图本身就是一篇复杂的“本文”，它像其他任何本文一样，可以加以争辩、翻译和各种不同的解释。,"An author's intention is itself a complex 'text', which can be debated, translated and variously interpreted just like any other."
9118,发[d]和[g]时软腭抬起，不让空气从鼻腔流出。而发[n]和M 时软腭垂下，空气从鼻子里流出，等到除阻时，还从口腔流出。,"The velum is raised in the production of [d] and [g], preventing the air from flowing through the nose, whereas for [n] and [ŋ] the velum is down, allowing the air out through both the nose and the mouth when the closure is released."
9118,因而[m]，[n]和M是鼻音[b]，[d]，[g]是口音。鼻音和带声这两个语音特征的出现与否可以把所有音素分为四类：带音、清音、鼻音、口音，见表6.3。,"The sounds [m], [n], and [ŋ] are therefore nasal sounds, and [b], [d], and [g] are oral sounds.The presence or absence of these phonetic features—nasal and voiced—permit the division of all speech sounds into four classes: voiced, voiceless, nasal, and oral, as shown in Table 6.3."
9119,现在来看比较习性学。有趣的是，比较习性学最早的动机之一是，希望通过“考察关于非人有机体的那种先验的和天赋的工作假说”，就能够说明人类思维的先验形式。,"Turning to comparative ethology, it is interesting to note that one of its earliest motivations was the hope that through the “investigation of the a priori, of the innate working hypotheses present in subhuman organisms,” it would be possible to shed light on the a priori forms of human thought."
9119,上述表述引自康瑞德•洛伦兹的一篇早期不为人知的论文。,This formulation of intent is quoted from an early and little-known paper by Konrad Lorenz.
9119,洛伦兹对此观点的进一步表达很像前一时期的皮尔士所作的表达。,Lorenz goes on to express views very much like those Peirce had expressed a generation earlier.
9120,现代理论很少再把修辞手法和比喻用语区别开来，而且甚至对修辞或比喻改变了的，某个词“普通的”或“原有的”意义质疑。,Recent theory rarely distinguishes figure from trope and has even questioned the notion of an ‘ordinary’ or ‘literal’ meaning from which figures or tropes swerve.
9120,就说比喻这个词，它本身是比喻的，还是非比喻的？,"For example, is the term metaphor itself literalor figurative?"
9120,雅各·德里达在“白色的神话”中证明了对比喻的理论解释看起来是多么不可避免地要依靠比喻。,"Jacques Derrida, in ‘White Mythology’, shows how theoretical accounts of metaphor seem inevitably to rely on metaphors."
9120,有些理论家甚至得出了一条自相矛盾的结论，认为语言从根本上说是比喻的，认为我们称为非比喻的语言也包括了比喻手法，而它们的比喻本质是一直被遗忘了。,Some theorists have even embraced the paradoxical conclusion that language is fundamentally figurative and that what we call literal language consists of figures whose figurative nature has been forgotten.
9121,尽管英语并非如此，在一些语言中，名词与标类语素同时出现，它们是能标记词的语义类别的语法语素。,"In some languages, though not English, nouns occur with classifiers, grammatical morphemes that indicate the semantic class of the noun."
9121,例如，在斯瓦希里语中，一个具有语义特征[人]的名词，在单数时用前缀m-标记，而复数时用wa-标记，如mtoto（孩子）和watoto（孩子们）。,"In Swahili a noun that has the semantic feature “human” is prefixed with m- if singular and wa- if plural, as in mtoto (child) and watoto (children)."
9121,另外，具有[人工制品]特征的名词，如bed（床）、chair（椅子）或knife（刀），单数时用标类语素ki标记，复数时用vi标记，比如kiti（椅子）和viti（椅子，复数）。,"A noun that has the feature “human artifact,” such as bed, chair, or knife, is prefixed with the classifiers ki if singular and vi if plural, for example, kiti (chair) and viti (chairs)."
9122,注意到这样一个极为常见的错误，就可以无所顾虑地强调快感和不快的意义。,"This very common mistake noted, the signiﬁcance of pleasure and  unpleasure  may  be  insisted  upon  without  misgiving."
9122,它们是表明我们活动的旺盛程度的最隐微的标志。,They are our most delicate signs of how our activities are thriving.
9122,不过由于最强烈的快乐也可能只表示某个局部的成功，而活动可能大体上是有害的，所以它们是需要十分谨慎地加以解释的标志。,"But since  even  the  most  intense delight  may  indicate only  a  local success and the activity be generally detrimental, they are signs which need a very wary interpretation."
9123,这样，酷儿理论就提出了打乱那种在变成女同性恋的表演中扮演中介的身份。,
9123,,"In this way, queer theory proposes a disruption of normative sexual identities and a conception of agency linked to the ‘performance’ which installs those identities."
9123,勃特勒的著述之所以为世人所知，正在于她将“表演性”观念与性或性别身份连接在一起。,Butler’s work is known above all for her association of the idea of ‘performativity’ with sexual or gendered identities.
9123,人们常常用这一观念定位一种能够自由地选择各种身份的戏剧性的自我。,"Often this is taken to posit a theatrical self, able to freely select from a range of possible identities."
9124,语言的这套蓝图是儿童在完成语言习得这一任务时带来的天生知识。,They are part of the innate blueprint for language that the child brings to the task of acquiring a language.
9124,儿童必须学习的是某一语言特有的语法知识。,What children must learn are the language specific aspects of grammar.
9124,当出现变异参数时，儿童必须对自己的语言做出正确的选择。,"Where there are parameters of variation, children must determine the correct choice for their language."
9125,层级结构也是人类语言的一个基本特征。,Hierarchical structure is an essential property of human language.
9125,词（以及句子）都有组成成分，都通过具体的规则管辖的方式相互关联。,"Words (and sentences) have component parts, which relate to each other in specific, rule-governed ways."
9125,尽管粗粗一看，如果不考虑次序，语素un-和-atic都以同样的方式和词根system相联系，但实际情况并非如此。,"Although at first glance it may seem that, aside from order, the morphemes un- and -atic each relate to the root system in the same way, this is not the case."
9126,但从定义上说，这两个故事的情节却是一样的。,But by definition the two stories have the same plot.
9126,实际上，勃里蒙混淆了阐释代码的活动与选择行为代码的活动。,"Bremond seems, in fact, to have confused the operations of the hermeneutic code with those of the proairetic code."
9126,后者的成分必须作反时间顺序的界定，而前者的成分则是按顺时间顺序加以识别，犹如对悬念或疑案的期待那样。,"Elements of the latter must be defined retrospectively, whereas those of the former are recognized prospectively, as a prospect of suspense or mystery."
9126,如果我们在此对阐释代码再说上几句，我们再回到情节结构的论题时思想准备就会更加充分了。,If we say a word about the hermeneutic code we shall be better prepared to return to plot structure proper.
9127,巴尔特没有讨论情节的不稳定性，虽然这个问题已包括在阐释代码的范畴之内。,"Barthes does not discuss uncertainties of plot, though they do fall within the scope of the hermeneutic code."
9127,他基本上关注的是身份属性的一点。,He is concerned primarily with mysteries of identity.
9127,书名往往变成这样的疑团：《米德尔马奇》一直读到第六章，我们才弄清它究竟是一个人，一个家族，一幢宅第，一座城市，还是一个主题隐喻。,"Titles tend to be enigmas of this kind: it is not until chapter 6 that we know whether Middlemarch is a person, a family, a house, a town or a thematic metaphor."
9128,理论常常是常识性观点的好斗的批评家。并且，它总是力图证明那些我们认为理应如此的常识实际上只是一种历史建构，是一种看来似乎已经很自然的理论，自然到我们甚至不认为它是理论的程度了。,"Theory is often a pugnacious critique of common-sense notions, and further, an attempt to show that what we take for granted as ‘common sense’ is in fact a historical construction, a particular theory that has come to seem so natural to us that we don’t even see it as a theory."
9128,"由于既批评常识，又探讨可供选择的概念,理论涉及对文学研究中最基本的前提或假设的质疑，即对任何没有结论却可能一直被认为是理所当然的事情提出质疑，比如：意义是什么？","As a critique of common sense and exploration of alternative conceptions, theory involves a questioning of the most basic premisses or assumptions of literary study, the unsettling of anything that might have been taken for granted: What is meaning?"
9128,作者是什么？,What is an author?
9128,读的是什么？,What is it to read?
9128,“我”或者写作的主体、解读的主体及行为的主体分别是什么？,"What is the‘I’ or subject who writes, reads, or acts?"
9128,文本与其产生的环境有什么关系？,How do texts relate to the circumstances in which they are produced?
9129,艺术家内在和外在的冲突就在于同这些陈套反应进行斗争，而通俗作家的胜利则在于利用了它们。,"Against these stock responses the artist’s internal and external conﬂicts  are  fought,  and  with  them  the  popular  writer’s  triumphs are made."
9129,任何组合这些普通想法的产物，只要达到了态度演变的应有水平或停留点，如果经过合适的宣传，肯定获得成功。,"Any combination of these general Ideas, hit at the  right  level  or  halting  point  of  development,  is,  if  suitably advertised,  certain  of  success."
9129,"所有艺术门类中的畅销作品都值得极其细微地研究，因为它们客观上示例说明了态度演变的最普通的水平，如果无法解释它们的广泛吸引力，无法言之有据地说明那些鄙视它的人未必是自命行家的道理,任何批评瑝论都不是令人满意的。","Best-sellers  in  all  the  arts, exemplifying  as  they  do  the  most  general  levels  of  attitude development, are worthy of very close study.No theory of criticism is satisfactory which is not able to explain their wide appeal and to give clear reasons why those who disdain them are not necessarily snobs."
9130,例如用于回答一个问题的一组词就是一个成分。,"For example, the set of words that can be used to answer a question is a constituent."
9130,所以在回答问题“what did you find（你找到了什么）？”时，说话者可能会回答a puppy（一条小狗），而不是found a（找到一[条]）。,"So in answer to the question “What did you find?” a speaker might answer a puppy, but not found a."
9130,A puppy可以独立完整存在，而found a不可以。,A puppy can stand alone while found a cannot.
9131,举例说，如果你把职业摔跤和拳击做个比较，你就会发现这里有不同的程式。拳击手被击中时表现得很坦然，而摔跤手却十分痛苦地扭动身体，夸张地扮演各种落入俗套的角色。,"If you compare professional wrestling with boxing, for instance, you can see that there are different conventions: boxers behave stoically when hit, while wrestlers writhe in agony and flamboyantly enact stereotyped roles."
9131,在拳击当中，对抗的规则在标明比赛不得超越界限这个意义上说是存在于比赛之外的。而在摔跤比赛中，规则完全是存在于比赛之内的，因为程式扩大了意义的范围，而意义又可以被创造：规则为被打破而存在，公开地被打破，所以“坏蛋”，或者恶棍就可以毫不掩饰地暴露他的邪恶和缺少体育道德， 而观众也会被煽动起充满报复的愤怒情绪。,"In boxing the rules of the contest are external to the match, in the sense that they designate limits beyond which it must not go, while in wrestling the rules are very much within the match, as conventions that increase the range of meaning that can be produced: rules exist to be violated, quite flagrantly, so that the ‘bad guy’ or villain may dramatically reveal himself as evil and unsporting and the audience be whipped up into vengeful fury."
9131,如此说来，摔跤提供的首先是一望而知的伦理道德满足感，因为善与恶的对立是清清楚楚的。,"Wrestling thus provides above all the satisfactions of moral intelligibility, as good and evil are clearly opposed."
9132,[ʃ]和[ʒ]是硬腭擦音，两者在mission[mɪʃən]（任务）和measure[mԑʒər]（量度）中有对立。,"[ʃ] and [ʒ] are palatal fricatives, and contrast in such pairs as mission [mɪʃən] and measure [mԑʒər]."
9132,气流通过舌头和龈后前腭处产生了摩擦。,
9132,,They are produced with friction created as the air passes between the tongue and the part of the palate behind the alveolar ridge.
9132,硬腭带擦音从不在英语固有词的开头出现，除了外国借词如genre（文体）。,"In English, the voiced palatal fricative never begins words except for foreign words such as genre."
9133,但是，在服装业规范这一更为基础的层次上却 出现了一些严重的、方法论方面的问题。,The serious methodological problems arise at the more basic level of the vestimentary code.
9133,这里，一切符号序列的意义是相同的：标题中所出现的一项，意思就是指这一项正在时兴。,Here all sequences have the same meaning: the presence of an item in a caption signiﬁes that it is fashionable.
9133,符号示义的过程却没有什么可说：时装杂志上登载的照片已经把能指和所指时尚联系起来。,And there is little to be said about the process of signiﬁcation: the fact that the picture is presented in a fashion magazine is what connects the signiﬁer and the signiﬁed Mode.
9134,现在我们可以用带声性、鼻音性、调音部位和调音方式来区别英语中所有的辅音。,"We are now capable of distinguishing all of the consonant sounds of English via the properties of voicing, nasality, and place and manner of articulation."
9134,例如 ，[f]是唇齿清（口）擦音；[n]是龈（带 ）鼻塞音。,"For example, [f] is a voiceless, (oral), labiodental fricative; [n] is a (voiced), nasal, alveolar stop."
9134,括号中的特征一般由于有冗余性就不说了。除非特别指出是鼻音之外，其他所有音都是口音；英语中所有鼻音都是带声的。,"The parenthesized features are usually not mentioned because they are redundant; all sounds are oral unless nasal is specifically mentioned, and all nasals are voiced in English."
9135,辅音还可进一步按调音方式分类。,Consonants are further classified according to their manner of articulation.
9135,可以分为清音或带音、口音或鼻音、长音或短音等。,"They may be voiced or voiceless, oral or nasal, long or short."
9135,也可以分为塞音、擦音、塞擦音、流音或滑音。,"They may be stops, fricatives, affricates, liquids, or glides."
9135,发带音时声带合拢并振动，发清音时声带打开不振动。,"During the production of voiced sounds, the vocal cords are together and vibrating, whereas in voiceless sounds they are apart and not vibrating."
9135,清音可以是送气的或不送气的。,Voiceless sounds may also be aspirated or unaspirated.
9135,发送气音时除阻后声带还分开一会儿，结果有一股气流冲出。,"In the production of aspirated sounds, the vocal cords remain apart for a brief time after the stop closure is released, resulting in a puff of air at the time of the release."
9135,辅音还可按照某些特征组成更大的类，如唇音、舌冠音、前腔音、咝音等。,"Consonants may be grouped according to certain features to form larger classes such as labials, coronals, anteriors, and sibilants."
9136,在第三章，我们讨论了词典学的性质--词典编纂，梳理了自塞缪尔·约翰逊的第一本词典到最新的牛津英语词典以来的词典学史。,In chapter 3 we discussed the nature and history of lexicography—the making of dictionaries—from the first dictionaries of Samuel Johnson to the updated Oxford English Dictionary (OED).
9136,现在每位词典编纂者都可谓计算词典编纂者。,Nowadays every lexicographer is a computational lexicographer.
9136,在没有电脑的情况下编写词典就如同1755年编写词典时没有羽管笔。,Writing a dictionary without a computer makes no more sense today than writing a dictionary without a quill would have made in 1755.
9137,另一种关系就是一个短语的中心语及其姐妹之间的关系。,Another kind of relationship is that between the head of a phrase and its sisters.
9137,短语的中心语就是其词汇范畴能够确定这个短语的类型的词，也就是名词短语中的名词，或动词短语中的动词等。,"The head of a phrase is the word whose lexical category defines the type of phrase: the noun in a noun phrase, the verb in a verb phrase, and so on."
9137,回顾一下上一节提到的PS树，我们看到每个VP都包含一个动词，这就是这个短语的中心语。,"Reviewing the PS rules in the previous section, we see that every VP contains a verb, which is its head."
9137,VP也可能包含其他范畴，诸如NP或CP，这些姐妹范畴都是补足语；它们使得这个短语的意义变得完整。,"The VP may also contain other categories, such as an NP or CP.Those sister categories are complements; they complete the meaning of the phrase."
9138,一个潜在的词由音位构成遵守该语言音位配列规则的序列。,A possible word contains phonemes in sequences that obey the phonotactic constraints of the language.
9138,一个事实上出现的词，是一个潜在的词和某个意义的结合。,"An actual, occurring word is the union of a possible word with a meaning."
9138,没有意义的可能词有时候叫作无意义词，有时也指词库中的偶然缺位，或词汇空缺。,"Possible words without meaning are sometimes called nonsense words and are also referred to as accidental gaps in the lexicon, or lexical gaps."
9138,因此，像creek 和crude这种“词”都是无意义词，代表了在英语词汇中碰巧产生的缺位。,Thus “words” such as creck and cruck are nonsense words and represent accidental gaps in the lexicon of English.
9139,词汇提取的许多特征可以通过词汇判定实验来检验。,Many properties of lexical access can be examined using lexical decision experiments.
9139,在以下例子中，当前呈现的词和刚刚呈现过的词之间的关系被控制起来。,"In the following example, the relationship between the current word and the immediately preceding word is manipulated."
9139,例如，当受试者判定doctor( 医生）一词时，倘若刚刚判定的词是nurse(护士），而不是与doctor语义上毫无关系的词，如flower(花朵），那么前者判定的速度就更快。,"For example, making a lexical decision on the word doctor will be faster if you just made a lexical decision on nurse than if you just made one on a semantically unrelated word such as flower."
9139,这种效应称为“语义启动”：我们说nurse一词启动doctor—词。,This effect is known as semantic priming: we say that the word nurse primes the word doctor.
9139,这种效应的成因也许在于语义相关的词处于心理词库的同一区域，因此，当我们听到一个启动词并在心理词库中查寻它时，它附近语义上与之相关的词会被“唤醒”，更容易在短时间内提取。,"This effect might arise because semantically related words are located in the same part of the mental lexicon, so when we hear a priming word and look it up in the lexicon, semantically related, nearby words are “awakened” and more readily accessible for a few moments."
9140,这些规则，以及很多类似的规则，着眼于词的意义并且根据句子的句法结构将词组合起来，解释了我们关于句子真值的知识。,"These rules, and many more like them, account for our knowledge about the truth value of sentences by taking the meanings of words and combining them according to the syntactic structure of the sentence."
9140,从上面的例子中我们可以很容易地看出歧义是如何产生的。,It is easy to see from these examples how ambiguous meanings arise.
9140,因为一个句子的意义是根据它的层级结构来计算的，不同的树形图有不同的意义——结构歧义一一甚至即使句子的词都相同的时候，例如The boy saw the man with a telescope。,"Because the meaning of a sentence is computed based on its hierarchical organization, different trees will have different meanings—structural ambiguity—even when the words are the same, as in the example The boy saw the man with a telescope."
9140,歧义词的出现----词汇歧义----如果与其他句子成分结合，可以使整个句子变得有歧义，例如She can’t bear children (她不能忍受小孩子/她不能生小孩）。,"The occurrence of an ambiguous word—lexical ambiguity—when it combines with the other elements of a sentence, can make the entire sentence ambiguous, as in She can’t bear children."
9141,如上所述，一个短语或者句子的意义，其中一部分是它们所包含的词的意义的一个函数。,"As just discussed, the meaning of a phrase or sentence is partially a function of the meanings of the words it contains."
9141,与此类似，许多词的意义也是组成这些词的语素（的意义）的一个函数，这一点我们在第三章已经了解到了。,"Similarly, the meaning of morphologically complex words is a function of their component morphemes, as we saw in chapter 3."
9141,然而，在词的意（或者“词汇语义”）与句子意义之间有一个基本的区别。,"However, there is a fundamental difference between word meaning—or lexical semantics—and sentence meaning."
9142,拉丁语有一套格词尾的复杂系统，这些后缀根据名词和动词的语法关系添加到名词上。,"Latin had case endings, suffixes on the noun based on its thematic role or its grammatical relationship to the verb."
9142,现在罗曼语已经找不到这些后缀了（关于语法格更为详尽的讨论，请参见第五章）。,These are no longer found in the Romance languages.(See chapter 5 for a more extensive discussion of thematic roles; the terms used by historical linguists are somewhat different than those used by modern semanticists.)
9142,下面是拉丁语名词lupus（狼）的词尾变化，即各种格的列表：,"The following is a declension, or list of cases, for the Latin noun lupus, “wolf”:"
9143,所阅读的短文经过精心安排，只包含有学生已经接触过的词汇和结构。学生翻译中的错误教师会当场纠正。,"Reading passages were carefully constructed to contain only vocabulary and structures to which learners had already been exposed, and errors in translation were corrected on the spot."
9143,教师会测试学生对语法规则、动词词形变化和词汇的掌握程度。,"Learners were tested on their mastery of rules, verb paradigms, and vocabulary."
9143,除了大声朗读自己翻译过来的短文外，学生并不经常使用目标语。,The students did not use the target language very much except in reading translated passages aloud.
9144,"尽管接受的刺激贫乏，儿童可以在短时间内毫不费力地习得语言，而且所有儿童、所有语言的发展阶段具有一致性规律。这就说明语言机制是先天的, 幼儿天生就拥有普遍语法（Universal Grammar），以此应对复杂的任务。","The ease and rapidity of children’s language acquisition and the uniformity of the stages of development for all children and all languages, despite the poverty of the stimulus they receive, suggest that the language faculty is innate and that the infant comes to the complex task already endowed with a Universal Grammar."
9144,"普遍语法不是像英语或阿拉伯语的语法, 而是代表所有人类语言所遵循的原则。","UG is not a grammar like the grammar of English or Arabic, but represents the principles to which all human languages conform."
9144,语言习得是一个创造性的过程。,Language acquisition is a creative process.
9144,"儿童基于语言输入创建文法, 并以普遍语法为指导。",Children create grammars based on the linguistic input and are guided by UG.
9145,因而，居于海德格尔思想中心的不是个别主体而是存在本身。,"What is central to Heidegger's thought, then, is not the individual subject but being itself."
9145,西方形而上学传统的错误在于将存在视为某种客观的实体，并使之与主体一刀两断。,"The mistake of the Western metaphysical tradition has been to see being as some kind of objective entity, and to separate it sharply from the subject."
9145,海德格尔却力图回到苏格拉底以前的思想，回到主体与对象的二元论尚未展开的时候，并将存在视为包括主体与对象两者之物。,"Heidegger seeks rather to return to pre-Socratic thought, before the dualism between subject and object opened up, and to regard being as somehow encompassing both."
9146,我在第二章中讲过，文学再现的力量有赖于它特有的独一和代表性的结合：读者看到的是对哈姆雷特王子，对简·爱，或者对哈克贝利·芬的描述，随着这些描述，他们又可以推论出这些人物遇到的麻烦是有代表性的。,"The power of literary representations depends, I suggested in Chapter 2, on their special combination of singularity and exemplarity: readers encounter concrete portrayals of Prince Hamlet or Jane Eyre or Huckleberry Finn, and with them the presumption that these characters’ problems are exemplary."
9146,不过，它们代表什么呢？,But exemplary of what?
9146,小说并没有说。,The novels don’t tell.
9146,于是就需要批评家或理论家们来做这个关于代表性的题目，并且告诉我们某角色代表哪一类人或哪个阶级：哈姆雷特的处境具有“普遍”性吗？,It’s the critics or theorists who have to take up the question of exemplarity and tell us what group or class of people the character stands for: Is Hamlet’s condition ‘universal’?
9146,简·爱的困境在妇女中很常见吗？,Is Jane Eyre’s the predicament of women in general?
9147,第二个测试就是“用代词替代”。,The second test is “replacement by a pronoun.”
9147,代词可以取代自然的词语组合。,Pronouns can substitute for natural groups.
9147,在回答问题“Where did you find a puppy ( 你在哪里找到了一条小狗）？”时，可以说“I found Mm in the park ( 我在公园找到他的）。,"In answer to the question “Where did you find a puppy?” a speaker can say, “I found him in the park.”"
9147,"”像d o 这样的词同样可以取代整个谓语found a p u p p y ,诸如John found a puppy and Bill did too (约翰找到了一条小狗，比尔也是）。","Words such as do can also take the place of the entire predicate found a puppy, as in “John found a puppy and Bill did too.”"
9147,如果一组词可以由一个代词或者像do这样的词替代，那么这组词就组成了一个成分。,"If a group of words can be replaced by a pronoun or a word like do, it forms a constituent."
9148,前面已经使用了代码这个术语，现在不妨稍稍进一步探讨它的含义。,The  term  ‘codes’  has  already  been  used  and  it  is  appropriate  now  to explore its implications a little further.
9148,我们把我们对世界的经验编成代码，我们从而可以体验这种经验在我们面前一般并不存在处于原始状态的经验。我们知道，上述这些观点直接来自萨皮尔、霍尔夫和列维-斯特劳斯的著作。,"The notion that we ‘encode’ our experience of the world in order that we may experience it; that there exists, in general, no pristine range of experiences open to us, comes directly,  as  we  have  seen,  from  the  work  of  Sapir,  Whorf  and  Lévi-Strauss."
9149,声调一般有功能，即能区别词义。,"Tones generally have a lexical function, that is, they make a difference between words."
9149,但在某些语言如尼日利亚中西部的埃多语中，声调还有语法功能。,"But in some languages tones may also have a grammatical function, as in Edo spoken in midwestern Nigeria."
9149,后接直接宾语的单音节动词上的声调表示动词的时态和及物性。,The tone on monosyllabic verbs followed by a direct object indicates the tense and transitivity of the verb.
9150,夏夫茨伯里在美学方面也一直注重得体、学识、刻意求工、“写作原则”和“艺术真实”这些为贺拉斯所推崇的优点。,"Shaftesbury's aesthetic emphasis, furthermore, is consistently on the Horatian virtues of decorum, learning, deliberate craftsmanship, 'the rules of writing' and the truth of art."
9150,因此，他发现莎士比亚“几乎在所有的韵致和整饰方面”都是粗犷的、不一致的、不充分的，他还讥笑那些单凭天才创作的作家，认为只有那些不知诗歌何以如此美妙的无能的读者才会把它们称作“我不知是什么，或我不可理解的东西”。才会认为它们是“一种连艺术家本人也无法解释的魅力或迷人之处”。,"'  He accordingly finds Shakespeare rude, incoherent, and deficient 'in almost all the graces and ornaments,' ridicules authors who rely on genius alone, and holds that only those feeble readers who respond to the beauties of poetry without knowledge of their cause will term them 'the je ne scay quoy, the unintelligible or the I know not what,' and suppose them (to be a kind of charm or enchantment of which the artist himself can give no account."
9151,按照朗吉努斯的论述，崇高是激情受到触发时瞬间的产物，而非出于冷静持续的考虑。,"In Longinus's treatment, sublimity is said to be the product of an inspired moment of passion，rather than of cool and sustained calculation."
9151,由此可及：（1)风格的这种最高尚的特性只涉及韵文和散文的小段落，而不是“创作中的技巧，合适的秩序或排布”，因为这些“不是一两件小事，而是作品的整体格局的艰苦努力得来的结果”。,"It follows that: (1)This highest quality of style invests only a short passage of verse and prose, as against 'skill in invention, and due order and arrangement' which emerge 'as the hard-won result not of one thing nor of two, but of the whole texture of the composition.'"
9151,同样因为这个道理，朗吉努斯所举的关于崇高的例子范围也很小，短的只是些词语或句子一“要有光啊，于是有了光”——至长也不过是选自萨福、荷马和德谟西尼斯等人的一些小段落。,"Accordingly, Longinus' instances of sublimity range only from a single phrase or sentence—'Let there be light, and there was light’—to short passages from Sappho, Homer, and Demosthenes."
9151,（2)这些片断突然对着听者激射而出，带着强度、震撼和光照：“时机一到便闪烁而出”，崇高“有如霹雳，所击之处万物尽散”。,"(2) This fragment bursts suddenly upon the auditor, with an effect of intensity, shock, and illumination: hashing forth at the right moment,' sublimity 'scatters everything before it like a thunderbolt.'"
9151,例如，德谟'西尼斯的崇高就富有“速度、力量和强度”的特点，“完全可以比作霹雳或闪电”。,"The sublimity of Demosthenes, for example, is characterized by 'speed, power, and intensity,' and 'may be compared to a thunderbolt or flash of lightning.'"
9152,其他地方都发生了创新变化，而唯有该地区还没有，地域方言的差异便可能产生。,Regional dialect differences may also arise when innovative changes occur everywhere but in a particular region.
9152,与其他方言相比，地域方言可能相对保守。,The regional dialect may be conservative relative to other dialects.
9152,例如在美国阿巴拉契亚山区会发现把it读成hit的情况，这是早期英语中的标准发音，而[h]的脱落则是后来的创新变化。,"The pronunciation of it as hit, found in the Appalachian region of the United States, was standard in older forms of English.The dropping of the [h] was the innovation."
9153,在许多不同的情况下，人们能够习得另一种语言。,People can acquire a second language under many different circumstances.
9153,在你开始读初中、高中或大学的时候，你也许已经学会了另一种语言。,"You may have learned a second language when you began middle school, or high school, or college."
9153,搬家到一个新的国家往往意味着习得一种新的语言。,Moving to a new country often means acquiring a new language.
9153,另外有些人，他们生活的社区或家庭中说多种语言，因此他们可 能同时习得两种（或更多）语言。,Other people live in communities or homes in which more than one language is spoken and may acquire two (or more) languages simultaneously.
9153,第二语言习得或二语习得这个术语一般指已经习得了母语的人（成人或儿童）再去习得另一种语言。,"The term second language acquisition, or L2 acquisition, generally refers to the acquisition of a second language by someone (adult or child) who has already acquired a first language.This is also referred to as sequential bilingualism."
9153,双语语言习得这个术语则是指从婴儿时（或三岁之前）开始同时习得两种语言。,"Bilingual language acquisition refers to the (more or less) simultaneous acquisition of two languages beginning in infancy (or before the age of three years),also referred to as simultaneous bilingualism."
9154,人类的语音按照语音属性分类。,Human speech sounds fall into classes according to their phonetic properties.
9154,所有的音素不是辅音，就是元音。而所有辅音不是阻音就是响音。,"All speech sounds are either consonants or vowels, and all consonants are either obstruents or sonorants."
9154,辅音在声道中有某种阻碍，阻碍处就定义了它们的调音部位，其中有双唇、唇齿、龈、腭、软腭、小舌、喉门。,"Consonants have some obstruction of the airstream in the vocal tract, and the location of the obstruction defines their place of articulation, some of which are bilabial, labiodental, alveolar, palatal, velar, uvular, and glottal."
9155,然而，像吉尼一样，切尔西一直没能把语法发展出来。,"However, like Genie, Chelsea has not been able to develop a grammar."
9155,对切尔西的语言脑定位进行的ERP研究显示，她大脑的两个半球对语言做出的反应是相同的。,ERP studies of the localization of language in Chelsea’s brain have revealed an equal response to language in both hemispheres.
9155,换句话说，切尔西的脑也未能表现出语言正常的非对称组织结构。,"In other words, Chelsea also does not show the normal asymmetric organization for language."
9156,爱德华·赛义德(Edward Said)的《东方主义》是一本最著名的、最受争议的著作。,Said’s Orientalism (1978) is his most celebrated and debated work.
9156,"更全面地说,它和另外两本产生更多争论的 著作《 巴勒斯坦问题》(1980)与《覆盖伊斯兰》(182) 一起构成了一个三部曲,是主要讨论以色列和巴勒斯坦忡突系列著作中的第一本。","In a full account, it belongs in a trilogy with the more polemical works, The Question of Palestine (1980) and Covering Islam (1982), the first of a series of writings dealing principally with the Israeli–Palestinian conflict."
9156,"赛义德指出, “ 东方主义 ”占据着三个相互搭接的领域。","The phenomenon of ‘Orientalism’, Said reasons, occupies three overlapping domains."
9157,尽管有上述种种变异，wh短语的移动总要受一定的限制。,"Despite these variations, wh movement adheres to certain constraints."
9157,"尽管wh短语，如what，who,which boy等，可以插入到任何NP位置，并且从原则上来说，可以自由移动到标补语位置上，但是也有一些具体的例子不允许移动wh短语。","Although wh phrases such as what, who, and which boy can be inserted into any NP position, and are then free in principle to move to C, there are specific instances in which wh movement is blocked."
9157,例如，wh短语无法移出一个关系小句，如 ...the senator that wanted to hire who（想要雇佣谁的那个参议员）中who无法移出，如例句1(b)所示。,"For example, a wh phrase cannot move out of a relative clause like the senator that wanted to hire who, as in (1b)."
9158,短语结构树同样还表现了一个句子中不同组成部分之间的关系，例如，句子的主语和直接宾语可以从结构上进行定义。,"Phrase structure trees also show relationships among elements in a sentence.For example, the subject and direct object of the sentence can be structurally defined."
9158,主语是离树根S最近的，或者说由S直接统制的NP。直接宾语就是离VP最近的，或者说由VP直接统制的NP。,"The subject is the NP that is closest to, or immediately dominated by, the root S. The direct object is the NP that is closest to, or immediately dominated by, VP."
9159,分析器是一种计算机程序，它尝试模拟我们称为“心理分析器” 的一种人脑官能。,A parser is a computer program that attempts to replicate what we have been calling the “mental parser.”
9159,与心理分析器一样，计算机中的分析器利用语法把一个短语结构指派给一个词汇串。,"Like the mental parser, the parser in a computer uses a grammar to assign a phrase structure to a string of words."
9159,它所利用的短语结构语法和词库与我们在第四章中讨论过的相似。,Parsers may use a phrase structure grammar and lexicon similar to those discussed in chapter 4.
9160,患有难治型癫痫症的病人，可能会通过切断大脑两半球之间的信息交流来进行治疗，即外科医生切开连接两半球的神经纤维网络—胼胝体（见图2.1）。,"People suffering from intractable epilepsy may be treated by severing communication between their two hemispheres.Surgeons cut through the corpus callosum (see Figure 2.1), the fibrous network that connects the two halves."
9160,当该信息通道被切断后，“两块脑”之间就没有任何信息交流了。,"When this pathway is severed, there is no communication between the “two brains.”"
9160,这种分裂脑患者也为语言的偏侧化提供了证据，并有助于理解人脑的对侧功能。,Such split-brain patients also provide evidence for language lateralization and for understanding contralateral brain functions.
9161,由此，我们看到，为了理解叔伯制，我们必须把它看成是一个系统中的一种关系，而为了理解这个系统的结构，必须把系统本身看作是一个整体。,"Thus we see that in order to understand the avunculate we must treat it as one relationship within a system, while the system itself must be considered as a whole in order to grasp its structure."
9161,这种结构依赖于四种条件（兄弟，姐妹，父亲和儿子），这四种条件由两对互相联系的对立事物这样联系起来：在两代人中的任一代，总会有一个肯定的关系和一个否定的关系。,"This structure rests upon four terms (brother, sister, father, and son), which are linked by two pairs of correlative oppositions in such a way that in each of the two generations there is always a positive relationship and a negative one."
9161,那么，这种结构的本质是什么？它的功能又是什么呢？,"Now, what is the nature of this structure, and what is its function?"
9161,答案是，这种结构是亲属关系最基本的形式，确切地说它是亲属关系的单位。,"The answer is as follows: This structure is the most elementary form of kinship that can exist.It is, properly speaking, the unit of kinship."
9162,第一种或许可以称之为“把任何描述性的抒情短诗看作是一种瞬间的顿悟。,The first might be stated as ‘attempt to read any brief descriptive lyric as a moment of epiphany’.
9162,”如果某个物体或情境成为一首诗的焦点，那么，按照约定俗称的理解，这本身就意味着它十分重要：它是一种强烈感情的“客观对应物”，或是出现即刻的感悟的场合。,"If an object or situation is the focus of a poem, that implies, by convention, that it is especially important: the ‘objective correlative’ of an intense emotion or the locus of a moment of revelation."
9162,这尤其适用于意象派诗歌，俳句，或其他短诗，它们通过抒情诗来强调它们的重要性。,"This applies particularly to imagist poems, haiku and other brief poems which allow the lyric form to assert their importance."
9163,为了达到俄狄浦斯情结的效果，儿童当然必须首先朦胧地意识到性的区别。,"For the drama of the Oedipus complex to come about at all, the child must of course have become dimly aware of sexual difference."
9163,正是父亲的介入象征着这种性的区别；拉康著作中的一个关键术语菲勒斯(phallus)表明了性区别的含义。,"It is the entry of the father which signifies this sexual difference; and one of the key-terms in Lacan's work, the phallus, denotes this signification of sexual distinction."
9163,只有在接受了性区别和明显不同的性角色是必然的事情这种观点后，原来一直没有意识到这类问题的儿童才能真正地“社会化”。,"It is only by accepting the necessity of sexual difference, of distinct gender roles, that the child, who has previously been unaware of such problems, can become properly 'socialized'."
9164,尧斯（Hans Robert Jauss）是德国“接受”理论（Rezeptionästhetik）的重要成员，他赋予读者导向批评一种历史的维度。,"Jauss, an important German exponent of ‘reception’ theory (Rezeptionästhetik), gave a historical dimension to reader-oriented criticism."
9164,他试图在无视历史的俄国形式主义与无视文本的社会理论之间达成一种妥协。,"He tried to achieve a compromise between Russian Formalism which ignores history, and social theories which ignore the text."
9164,尧斯写作的年代是社会动荡不安的20世纪60年代末期，他和其他一些人要求对德国文学中古老的经典提出质疑，并且说明这种要求完全是合理的。,"Writing during a period of social unrest at the end of the 1960s, Jauss and others wanted to question the old canon of German literature and to show that it was perfectly reasonable to do so."
9165,20世纪初的俄国形式主义者强调批评家应该关心文学的文学性：使其成为文学的文字技巧，包括语言本身的突出和这些技巧“创新立异”的经验。,"The Russian Formalists of the early years of the twentieth century stressed that critics should concern themselves with the literariness of literature: the verbal strategies that make it literary, the foregrounding of language itself, and the ‘making strange’ of experience that they accomplish."
9165,形式主义者把注意力从作者引向文字“手段”，声称“手段是文学的唯一英雄”。,"Redirecting attention from authors to verbal ‘devices’, they claimed that ‘the device is the only hero of literature’."
9165,我们应该向类似于“这首十四行诗怎么了？”或者“在这本狄更斯所著的书里，什么令人激动的情节降临到小说里？”这样的问题，而不是问“作者在这里说什么？”。,Instead of asking ‘what does the author say here?’we should ask something like ‘what happens to the sonnet here?’ or ‘what adventures befall the novel in thisbook by Dickens?’
9166,语音由唇舌发出......人说话靠的是他所吸入体内尤其是腹腔中的空气。,The voice is articulated by the lips and the tongue.. . . Man speaks by means of the air which he inhales into his entire body and particularly into the body cavities.
9166,当空气通过空间排出时由于颅腔共鸣，便产生一种声音。,"When the air is expelled through the empty space it produces a sound, because of the resonances in the skull."
9166,舌头的活动控制了发音。它先把空气聚在咽喉，然后让空气顶开腭、齿的阻碍，把它们压出，于是造成某种有特定音质的声音。,"The tongue articulates by its strokes; it gathers the air in the throat and pushes it against the palate and the teeth, thereby giving the sound a definite shape."
9166,假如每次都不让舌头活动以控制发音，说话就不清楚，只能发出很少几个音。,"If the tongue would not articulate each time, by means of its strokes, man would not speak clearly and would only be able to produce a few simple sounds."
9167,滑音[j]是一个腭音，发音时舌尖(舌前部不包括舌尖)抬向硬腭，部位跟发beat[bit](打)中的元音i几乎相同。发you [ju] (你)时舌头从[j]很快滑向元音[u]。,The glide [j] is a palatal sound; the blade of the tongue (the front part minus the tip) is raised toward the hard palate in a position almost identical to that in producing the vowel sound [i] in the word beat [bit].
9167,"发滑音[w]时,舌后部抬向软腭，同时撮圆嘴唇。",The glide [w] is produced by both rounding the lips and simultaneously raising the back of the tongue toward the velum.
9167,因此它是一个圆唇软腭滑音。,It is thus a labio-velar glide.
9168,虽然儿童听到许多语句，但是他们听到的语言不完整、有噪声而且缺乏组织性。,"Although children hear many utterances, the language they hear is incomplete, noisy, and unstructured."
9168,前面说过，儿童导向语基本上是合式的，但是儿童还要接触成人之间的交谈。,"We said earlier that child-directed speech is largely well formed, but children are also exposed to adult–adult interactions."
9168,后者包括许多口误、错误的开头、不合语法和不完整的句子，但并不包括哪些语句合式而哪些又不合式的信息。,"These utterances include slips of the tongue, false starts, ungrammatical and incomplete sentences, and no consistent information as to which utterances are well formed and which are not."
9169,至此为止，我们在本书中已经考察过的大部分文学理论都可以被认为是对于文学作品的某种二次修正。,Most of the literary theory we have examined so far in this book could be considered a form of 'secondary revision' of the literary text.
9169,在对于“和谐”、“一致”、“深层结构”或者“根本意义”的执着追求中，这类理论为本文补苴罅漏，弭平矛盾，调和分裂，消除冲突。,"In its obsessive pursuit of 'harmony', 'coherence', 'deep structure' or 'essential meaning', such theory fills in the text's gaps and smooths over its contradictions, domesticating its disparate aspects and defusing its conflicts."
9169,它这么做就好像是为了让作品更容易被“消费”——为读者铺平道路，使他不会受到任何无法解释的反常现象的干扰。,"It does this so that the text may be, so to speak, more easily 'consumed' — so that the path is made straight for the reader, who will not be ruffled by any unexplained irregularities."
9170,大多数人处在这两个极端之间的某个位置上。,Most people fall somewhere in the middle.
9170,成功可能取决于一系列因素，包括年龄、才能、动机，以及你是身在说那种语言的国家，还是仅仅每周花5个上午坐在教室里然后就对该语言的母语者敬而远之。,"Success may depend on a range of factors, including age, talent, motivation, and whether you are in the country where the language is spoken or sitting in a classroom five mornings a week with no further contact with native speakers."
9170,因为所有这些原因，许多人包括许多研究L2习得的语言学家都相信，第二语言习得与第一语言习得很不一样。,"For all these reasons, many people, including many linguists who study L2 acquisition, believe that second language acquisition is something different from first language acquisition."
9170,这种假设被称为L2习得的“根本差异假说”。,This hypothesis is referred to as the fundamental difference hypothesis of L2 acquisition.
9171,结构主义人类学家克劳德·列维施特劳斯在分析俄底浦斯神话时，采用了真正的结构主义语言学模式。,"Claude Lévi-Strauss, the structuralist anthropologist, analyses the Oedipus myth in a manner which is truly structuralist in its use of the linguistic model."
9171,他借鉴语言学中的音素和词素，把神话中的单元叫做“神话素”（可比较语言学中的“音素”和“语素”）。,He calls the units of myth ‘mythemes’(compare phonemes and morphemes in linguistics).
9171,这些神话素像基本的语言单元一样，以二元对立形式组合在一起（见前文第65页）。,"They are organized in binary oppositions(see above, p. 65) like the basic linguistic units."
9172,针对这个骗人的过程，巴尔特提出一种文学观，用弗雷德里克·詹姆森的话说，就是高度“习俗化了的活动”。,"In place of this deceitful process, Barthes offers the notion of literature as what Fredric Jameson calls a highly ‘conventionalized activity’."
9172,根据这种观点，索绪尔的能指和所指关系又溶进“另一种具有代码性质的符号指示”。因此，文学显示出本质上的二重性。,"In it, the Saussurean signifier–signified relationship is complicated by ‘another type of  signification which bears on the nature of the code itself.’ In consequence, literature exhibits a fundamental duplicity."
9173,正如让-米歇尔·拉巴尔特在其2002年的著作中所说的，“发生学研究”是文学研究中与科学关系紧密唯一留存下来的例证。,"‘Genetic Criticism’, as Jean-Michel Rabaté (2002) suggests, is the key remaining example of literary study’s relation to science."
9173,它和历史的方法也有某种亲和性，当然这要看我们如何看待“历史”。,"It has some affinities, too, with historical method – though much depends then on what we mean by ‘history’."
9173,尽管“发生学研究”一方面受新历史主义或文化唯物主义以及解构论（用文本差异的具体例证置换“原本”的尊大观念）的影响，可它另一方面也颇像从文本档案馆中钩稽那些潜藏的无可辩驳的事实的研究。,"For although, on the one hand, ‘genetic criticism’ owes something to New Historicism or Cultural Materialism and to Deconstruction (displacing a reverential notion of the ‘original’ with the material evidence of textual difference), it can also sound like a reassertion of undisputed ‘fact’ anchored in the physical evidence of the textual archive."
9174,这并非意味着整个海德格尔哲学就是法西斯主义的理论基础。,This is not to suggest that Heidegger's philosophy as a whole is no more than a rationale for fascism.
9174,只是，它像法西斯主义一样，也为现代历史危机提供了一种假想的解决方案。因此，二者具有很多相似的特征。,"It is to suggest that it provided one imaginary solution to the crisis of modern history as fascism provided another, and that the two shared a number of features in common."
9175,"当语义规则和语境解释确定一个代词与一个NP同指,我们就说这个代词受约束于名词短语先行词。",
9175,"如果前面的例子中her指 the woman,那么它就是一个受约束代词。",In this case her refers to each one of the girls in the class and is said to be bound to every girl.
9175,反身代词总是受约束性的。,Reflexive pronouns are always bound.
9175,如果一个代词指称话语中没有明确提及的对象，它就被称为自由或者非受约束代词。,"When a pronoun refers to some entity outside the sentence or not explicitly mentioned in the discourse, it is said to be free or unbound."
9175,,"So, her in the sentences in (1) and (2) need not be bound to Mary or to every girl and can also refer to some arbitrary girl."
9175,自由代词的指称最终必须取决于情景语境。,The reference of a free pronoun must ultimately be determined by the situational context.
9176,词义相反的词就是反义词。,Words that are opposite in meaning are antonyms.
9176,反义词分为几种。,There are several kinds of antonymy.
9176,一种是互补反义词对：alive/dead present/absent awake/asleep     活的/死的   在场/缺席     醒着/睡着,There are complementary pairs: alive/dead present/absent awake/asleep
9177,但有一支北美英语的社会方言成为被偏见忽略的牺牲品。,"There is, however, a social dialect of North American English that has been a victim of prejudicial ignorance."
9177,这一方言就是非裔美国英语（AAE），由大量非洲后裔的美国人所使用。,"This dialect, African American English (AAE), is spoken by a large population of Americans of African descent."
9177,这种英语方言的独特之处因社会、教育和经济等原因而持续存在。,"The distinguishing features of this English dialect persist for social, educational, and economic reasons."
9178,随着布拉格学派的著作，术语“结构主义”与“符号学”一词或多或少地混合了。,"With the work of the Prague school, the term 'structuralism' comes moreor less to merge with the word 'semiotics'."
9178,“符号学”意味着对于符号的系统研究，而这也是文学结构主义者实际进行的工作。,"'Semiotics', or 'semiology', means the systematic study of signs, and this is what literary structuralists are really doing."
9178,“结构主义”一词本身表明一种研究方法，它可以被应用于从足球比赛到经济生产方式等完整的对象系列；“符号学”表示一个相当特殊的研究领域，即系统领域。这些系统在一般意义上被看作符号：诗、鸟语、交通信号、病症等等。,"The word 'structuralism' itself indicates a method of enquiry, which can be applied to a whole range of objects from football matches to economic modes of production; 'semiotics' denotes rather a particular field of study, that of systems which would in an ordinary sense be regarded as signs: poems, bird calls, traffic lights, medical symptoms and so on."
9179,,Here are some other terms used to form subclasses of consonantal sounds.
9179,下面是纯辅音的下位分类，但没有穷尽所有辅音，那需要上完整的语音课才能做到，此处不赘。,"These are not exhaustive, nor are they mutually exclusive (e.g., the interdentals belong to two subclasses).A full course in phonetics would note further classes that we omit."
9179,唇音[p][b][m][f][v]。,Labials [p] [b] [m] [f] [v] [w] [ʍ] Labial sounds are those articulated with the involvement of the lips.
9179,唇音是用嘴唇来发的，包括双唇音[p][b][m]和唇齿音[f][v]。,"They include the class of bilabial sounds [p] [b] and [m], the labiodentals [f] and [v], and the labiovelars [w] and [ʍ]."
9180,allege(动词): 意指“没有证据的声称”，declarer=subject (宣称的人=主语)，declaration=complement sentence (宣称的话=辅助句)。这里每一项都列出它的定义以及扮演角色的人。,"allege: verb; means ''to declare without proof ""; declarer = subjectdeclaration = complement sentence; Each of these entries lists a definition (in mentalese) of some kind of event, followed by the players that have roles in the event."
9180,这些项目告诉我们角色扮演者如何被放进句了中—当作主语、受词、介词的受词，和夹在句子中的子句等等。,"The entry indicates how each role-player may be plugged into the sentence —— as a subject, an object, a prepositional object, an embedded sentence, and so on."
9181,"虽然改写对孩子有潜在的帮助, 但它们的使用方法并不一致。","Although recasts are potentially helpful to the child, they are not used in a consistent way."
9181,"对四十名四岁以下儿童的母亲进行的一项研究表明, 儿童不合语法的句子里，只有25%被改写, 而且总的来说,合乎语法的句子与不合语法的句子被改写的比例大同小异。","One study of forty mothers of children two to four years old showed that only about 25 percent of children’s ungrammatical sentences are recast and that overall, grammatical sentences were recast as often as bad sentences."
9181,较之语法，父母更倾向于关注内容正确与否。,Parents tend to focus on the correctness of content more than on grammaticality.
9181,"因此, 父母会对许多不合语法的话语忽略不谈, 而会改变许多合乎语法的话语。",So parents allow many ungrammatical utterances to “slip by” and change many grammatical utterances.
9181,一个依赖改写来学习语法的孩子将会非常困惑。,A child who relied on recasts to learn grammar would be mightily confused.
9182,“幻想的快感更有益于健康。,‘The pleasures of Fancy are more conducive to health than those of the understanding.
9182,”“强烈感情的自发流溢，“文字完美，安排完美。”“人处于活动时的整个灵魂，统一性寓于多样性。”,’ ‘The spontaneous overflow of powerful feeling.’ ‘The best words in the best order.’ ‘The whole soul of man in activity.’
9183,艺术技巧是使事物变得“陌生”，使形式变得困难，是增加感觉的难度和长度，因为感觉过程就是审美目的的本身，因此必须延长。,"The technique of art is to make objects ‘unfamiliar’, to make forms difficult, to increase the difficulty and length of perception because the process of perception is an aesthetic end in itself and must be prolonged."
9183,艺术是体验一个事物艺术性的一种方式；事物本身是不重要的。,Art is a way of experiencing the artfulness of an object; the object is not important.
9183,（什克洛夫斯基自己的强调）,
9183,,"(Lemon and Reis, 1965, p. 12; Shklovsky’s emphasis)"
9184,但是感情转移也使分析者在他们所能介入的有控制的情况下洞察到别人所难以洞察的病人的心理生活。,"But transference also provides the analyst with a peculiarly privileged insight into the patient's psychical life, in a controlled situation in which he or she can intervene."
9184,（精神分析者自己在受培训过程中也必须接受分析，其原因之一是要让他们能够相当清醒地意识到他们自己的潜意识过程，以便尽可能防止将他们自己的问题“反转移”到他们的病人身上。,"(One of the several reasons why psychoanalysts must themselves undergo analysis in training is so that they can become reasonably aware of their own unconscious processes, thus resisting as far as possible the danger of 'counter-transferring' their own problems to their patients.)"
9184,）由于这一移情的戏剧效果，以及它为分析者提供的洞察与介入，病人的问题可逐渐按照精神分析场合的情况重新加以解释。,"By virtue of this drama of transference, and the insights and interventions which it permits the analyst, the patient's problems are gradually redefined in terms of the analytic situation itself."
9185,"不要以为他们的动词都没有时态变化，所以语言太粗糙。这些动词 go, stay, came, 或短语one time不是偶然的英文用字，而是夏威夷克里奧语文法的往常性系统化用法。这些字己经被克里奥语的使用者转化成助词、介词，表示“格”的标记及相关代词。","Do not be misled by what look like crudely placed English verbs, such as “go”, “stay”, and “came”, or phrases like “one time”.They are not haphazard uses of English words but systematic uses of Hawaiian Creole grammar: the words have been converted by the creole speakers into auxiliaries, prepositions, case markers, and relative pronouns."
9185,"事实上，一个己经行之有年的语言，它的前置和语尾文法词的由来，例如英文动词的过去式-ed的语尾变化就是来自动词do,He hammered最早以前是He hammer-did。","In fact, this is probably how many of the grammatical prefixes and suffixes in established languages arose.For example, the English past­tense ending -ed may have evolved from the verb do: “He hammered” was originally something like “He hammer-did”."
9186,在印欧语的历史上，形态规则发生了广泛的变化。,Extensive changes in morphology have occurred in the history of the IndoEuropean languages.
9186,拉丁语有一套格词尾的复杂系统，这些后缀根据名词和动词的语法关系添加到名词上。,"Latin had case endings, suffixes on the noun based on its thematic role or its grammatical relationship to the verb."
9186,现在罗曼语已经找不到这些后缀了（关于语法格更为详尽的讨论，请参见第五章）。,These are no longer found in the Romance languages.(See chapter 5 for a more extensive discussion of thematic roles; the terms used by historical linguists are somewhat different than those used by modern semanticists.)
9187,伊赛尔的阅读模式基本上是功能主义的：部分必须前后一贯地适应整体。,Iser's model of reading is fundamentally functionalist: the parts must be made to adapt coherently to the whole.
9187,事实上，在这个武断的偏见之后，隐藏着格式塔心理学的影响：一心把相互分离的感觉综合成为可解的整体。,"Behind this arbitrary prejudice, in fact, lies the influence of Gestalt psychology, with its concern to integrate discrete perceptions into an intelligible whole."
9187,的确，这一偏见在现代批评家中如此流行，以致很难将之仅仅视为一种理论上的偏爱。它并不比其他任何问题更少争论性。,"It is true that this prejudice runs so deep in modern critics that it is difficult to see it as just that – a doctrinal predilection, which is no less arguable and contentious than any other."
9188,当不同的群体说某种语言的方式存在系统性的变异，那么我们就认为每个群体说的是该语言的一种方言。,"When there are systematic differences in the way groups speak a language, we say that each group speaks a dialect of that language."
9188,方言是存在系统差异的语言能够相互理解的形式。,Dialects are mutually intelligible forms of a language that differ in systematic ways.
9188,每个讲话者，不论贫富，也无论所属地域或种族，都至少能说一种方言，这就像每个人都能说一种个人方言一样。,"Every speaker, whether rich or poor, regardless of region or racial origin, speaks at least one dialect, just as each individual speaks an idiolect."
9189,个体双语能力有不同的程度。,There are various degrees of individual bilingualism.
9189,有些人天生喜欢两种语言的控制，而另一些人经常使用两种语言，熟练程度高，但缺乏以一种或另一种语言为母语或接近母语的人的语言能力。,"Some people have native-like control of two languages, whereas others make regular use of two languages with a high degree of proficiency but lack the linguistic competence of a native or near native speaker in one or the other language."
9189,此外，一些双语者可能有口头能力，但不能阅读或写一种或多种语言。,"Also, some bilinguals may have oral competence but not read or write one or more of their languages."
9190,美学对象，比如绘画或者文学作品，通过把作用于感官的形式（色彩、声音）和精神的内涵（思想理念）融为一体来实现把物质与精神结合在一起的可能性。,"Aesthetic objects, such as paintings or works of literature, with their combination of sensuous form (colours, sounds) and spiritual content (ideas), illustrate the possibility of bringing together the material and the spiritual."
9190,一部文学作品就是一个美学对象，这正是因为文学具有最初使其得以定位，或者说使其得以存在的交流功能。它可以使读者去思考形式与内容之间的内在的关系。,"A literary work is an aesthetic object because, with other communicative functions initially bracketed or suspended, it engages readers to consider the interrelation between form and content."
9191,巴尔特的语言模式要求他从一个系统的共时状态中收集一组素材，而时装显然最适合作这样的处理，因为当服装设计师每年推出新的款式时，时装流行款式就会发生明显的变化。,"Barthes’s linguistic model requires him to collect a corpus of data from a single synchronic state of the system, and fashion, of course, is eminently suitable for such treatment since it changes abruptly once a year when designers bring out their new collections."
9191,巴尔特把每年发行的《她》和《时装园地》上的解释标题汇集起来，便获得了一组可以把握的素材。他希望，这组素材中能够包括该系统 在这个阶段上的各种不同的可能性。,"By taking captions from a year’s issues of Elle and Jardin des Modes, Barthes creates a manageable corpus which, he hopes, will contain the diﬀerent possibilities of the system at that stage."
9192,吉尼的话语中缺乏助动词、冠词、第三人称单数的一致性标记、过去时标记和大部分代词。,"Genie’s utterances lacked articles, auxiliary verbs like will or can, the third-person singular agreement markers, the past-tense marker-ed, question words like who, what, and where, and pronouns."
9192,她不能构造类型更为复杂的句子，比如主语和动词位置互换的疑问句（例如：Are you hungry?,"She had no ability to form more complex types of sentences such as questions (e.g., Are you feeling hungry?"
9192,“你饿了吗”）。吉尼是在关键期过后才开始学习语言的，因此不能完全习得英语的语法规则。,).Genie started learning language after the critical period and was therefore never able to fully acquire the grammatical rules of English.
9193,不合语法的句子表明，要构建一个问句，就要移动位置最高的S的Aux，也就是说把跟在整个第一个NP之后的Aux移位到主语之前，而不是移动句子中出现的第一个助动词。,"The ungrammatical sentences show that to form a question, the rule that moves Aux singles out the auxiliary dominated by the root S, and not simply the first auxiliary in the sentence."
9193,我们可以通过如下简化的短语结构树明白这一点。,We can see this in the following simplified phrase structure trees.
9193,一共有两个助动词，一个出现在主语关系小句中，一个出现在主句中。,"There are two auxiliaries, one in the subject relative clause and the other in the root clause."
9193,规则能影响的是出现在位置较高的主句中的助动词。,The rule affects the auxiliary in the higher main clause.
9194,但是，一般的看法是，除了诗以外，文学还包括很多其他的东西——例如，包括现实主义和自然主义的作品，它们没有语言上的自我意识，也不以任何引人注目的方式自我炫耀。,"But literature is usually judged to contain much besides poetry — to include, for example, realist or naturalistic writing which is not linguistically self-conscious or self-exhibiting in any striking way."
9194,人们有时称某一作品为“优美”作品，正因为它并不过分引人注目，他们欣赏它的简洁平易或笔调稳健。,People sometimes call writing 'fine' precisely because it doesn't draw undue attention to itself: they admire its laconic plainness or low-keyed sobriety.
9194,况且，对于那些总是词藻华丽，但一般并不划为文学的玩笑、足球拉拉歌和口号、报纸标题和广告，我们又该怎么说呢？,"And what about jokes, football chants and slogans, newspaper headlines, advertisements, which are often verbally flamboyant but not generally classified as literature?"
9195,我常在思考归纳法，它要找的类化不是邻居的语言行为，而是严厉的自然世界。,"It makes one wonder the more about other inductions, where what is sought is a generalization not about our neighbor's verbal behav­ior but about the harsh impersonal world."
9195,假如说，我们的心智性质空间跟我们邻居的差不多应是合理，毕竟同样是人，物以类聚。所以在字汇学习上，归纳法的可信度是一个可预见的事。,"It is reasonable that our [mental] quality space should match our neighbor's, we being birds of a feather; and so the general trustworthiness of induction in the ... learning of words was a put-up job."
9196,在文艺复兴时期，新兴的中产阶级想要自己的子女说“上层” 阶级的方言。,In the Renaissance a new middle class emerged who wanted their children to speak the dialect of the “upper” classes.
9196,这一愿望使得许多规定语法得以出版。,This desire led to the publication of many prescriptive grammars.
9196,1762年，罗伯特 • 洛思主教写了一部 《英语语法 简论及评注》（A Short Introduction to English Grammar with Critical N otes)。,In 1762 Bishop Robert Lowth wrote A Short Introduction to English Grammar with Critical Notes.
9196,洛思为英语制定了许多新规则，很多规定受到了他个人偏好的影响。,"Lowth prescribed a number of new rules for English, many of them influenced by his personal taste."
9197,正如奈维尔·威克菲尔德(Neville Wakefield)评论的那样，这种内爆“导向一个仿作的、非空间的过真实。这里，‘真 实’要由它运动于其间的传媒来界定”。在波德里雅看来，正是这种创造形象的后现代交往技术(特别是电视)激发了跨越后现代表面的大量的形象自我生产。,"This implosion, as Neville Wakefield comments, leads ‘into the simulated non-space of hyperreality. The “real” is now defined in terms of the media in which it moves.’ It is the image-creating postmodern communication technologies – especially television – which for Baudrillard stimulate this proliferation of self-generating images across the postmodern surface."
9198,我们不妨以索绪尔所举的例子加以说明：虽然，法语口语中的mouton与英语中的sheep有时可以表示同义，如英语There's a sheep与法语Voila un mouton就是同义语，但是，这两个词在各自的语言系统中却有不同的价值。,"To use Saussure’s example, although in speech the French mouton and the English sheep may be used with the same signiﬁcation (There’s a sheep being synonymous with Voilà un mouton), the words have diﬀerent values in their respective linguistic systems in that sheep contrasts with mutton while mouton is not deﬁned by a corresponding contrast."
9198,在英语中sheep与mutton有别，然而法语中的mouton却并不受相应区分的界定。,
9198,我们对任何系统进行分析，都需要具体弄清纵组合关系（功能性差异）和横组合关系（组合的可能性）。,The analysis of any system will require one to specify paradigmatic relations (functional contrasts) and syntagmatic relations (possibilities of combination).
9199,后结构主义传到英国并不是通过德里达-拉康-福柯这一条线，而是通过马克思主义理论家路易·阿尔都塞的作品传入的，这点与美国的情况不同。,"In Britain, unlike the United States, post-structuralism arrived not through Derrida and then Lacan and Foucault but through the work of the Marxist theorist Louis Althusser."
9199,在阐释英国左派的马克思主义文化中，阿尔都塞把读者引向了拉康的理论，并且激起一场逐渐的变革。正如安东尼•伊斯索普说的，“通过这场变革，后结构主义逐渐占据了 与它的发起文化——马克思主义——相同的空间”。,"Read within the Marxist culture of the British left, Althusser led his readers to Lacanian theory and provoked a gradual transformation by which, as Antony Easthope puts it, ‘post-structuralism came to occupy much the same space as that of its host culture, Marxism’."
9200,即使在索绪尔的语言理论中也可以找到后结构主义反叛运动的端倪。,It is possible to see the beginnings of a poststructuralist counter- movement even in Saussure’s linguistic theory.
9200,我们知道，语言表达了语言的体系性特征，是言语这种个人言说或写作的基础性结构。,"As we have seen, langue is the systematic aspect of language which works as the underpinning structure of parole, the individual instance of speech or writing."
9200,符号也是两分的：能指和所指犹如一个硬币的两面。,The sign is also bipartite: signifier and signified are like two sides of a coin.
9201,为了满足句子(S)网络中的名词短语弧(NP arc)，整个名词短语网络都被转移了。,"To satisfy the NP arc in the S network, the entire NP network is traversed."
9201,在该情况下，名词短语是由一个代词构成的，而这又是由所需要的概念决定的。,"In this case, the NP is to be a Pronoun, as determined by the concept needed."
9201,然后这个名词短语弧在句子 网络中就会向下一个节点移动，转移它的系统就在节点2中。,"The NP arc is then traversed in the S network, and the system is at node 2."
9201,为了使转移能够完成，必须根据要交流的概念建构一个合适的动词短语，并使得那个概念符合该动词短语的结构，这也可用另一个转移网络来表示。,"To finish, an appropriate verb phrase must be constructed according to the concept to be communicated.That concept is made to comply with the structure of the VP, which is also expressed as a transition network."
9202,最终，这种图画文字也开始同时代表概念和表示这一概念的词。,"Eventually, these pictograms came to represent both the concept and the word for the concept."
9202,一旦发展到这一步，象形文字就演变为真正的表语文字系统。,"Once this happened, hieroglyphics became a bona fide logographic writing system."
9202,通过画谜原理，埃及象形文字也演变成一种音节文字。,"Through the rebus principle, hieroglyphics also became a syllabic writing system."
9203,假如“花园步道”的句子耐以用普通常识来避免的话，这个句子应该容易一点。,"If garden paths can be avoided by common-sense knowledge, this sentence should be much easier."
9203,证据，不像被告，它只能被检查不能去检查别人，所以不正确的分枝应该是可以避免的。,"Evidence, unlike defendants, can't examine anything, so the incorrect tree, in which the evidence would be examining something, is potentially avoidable."
9203,实验证据显示受试者的确可以避免错误，受试者的眼睛跳过这个字，很少停留也很少再回去扫描。,People do avoid it: the subjects' eyes hopped through the sentence with little pausing or backtracking.
9204,但赫希并不认为，既然一部作品的意义与作者写作时意谓的东西相一致，因此本文就只能有一种解释。,"It does not follow for Hirsch that because the meaning of a work is identical with what the author meant by it at the time of writing, only one interpretation of the text is possible."
9204,也许有多种不同的有效解释，但它们全都在作者意义所能允许的“典型的期待与可能性的系统”之内活动。,"There may be a number of different valid interpretations, but all of them must move within the 'system of typical expectations and probabilities' which the author's meaning permits."
9204,赫希也不否认，一部文学作品对于不同时代的不同人们可能“意味”着不同的东西。,Nor does Hirsch deny that a literary work may 'mean' different things to different people at different times.
9204,但他主张，较为合适的说法是，这是对于作品的“会解”问题而非作品的“本义”问题。,"But this, he claims, is more properly a matter of the work's 'significance' rather than its 'meaning'."
9205,但是，批评若依循诗是获取效果的工具这一定义的逻辑，那就要将其讨论的立足点从外界自然逐步转向人性——即诗人的欣赏者一并认为，真实或称盖然性就是与读者的期待的反应保持一致。,"But progressively criticism, following the logic of the definition of poetry as an instrument for achieving effects, transferred the locus of discussion from external nature to human nature—that of the poet's audience—and interpreted truth or probability as conformity to the expectations or responsiveness of the reader."
9205,这一转变可以从法文术语中看出来。,The French terms indicate this shift.
9205,诗的基本要求不是levrai，而是le Nraisemblable，即不是真实而是逼真；而“逼真性”，按拉潘的说法，“就是一切与公众意见一致的东西”。,"The basic requirement is not le vrai, but Uvratsemblable, not verity but verisimilarity; and le vraisemblable,' according to Rapin, 'est tout ce qui est conforms a l'opinion du public.'"
9205,因此在十八世纪的理论进程中，对诗的神奇性的探讨包含了对诗的假象，或者用凯姆斯的话说，“睁眼梦”的心理的十分详尽的分析。,"In the course of eighteenth-century theory, therefore, the discussion of the poetic marvelous involved an ever more elaborate analysis of the psychology of poetic illusion, or the 'waking dream,' as Kames called it."
9206,这还不仅是说，似乎我们拥有所谓事实知识这样一种东西，而它们可能会被特定的利害关系和价值判断所歪曲，虽然这种情况当然也是可能的；这种说法也意味着，没有特定的利害关系，我们根本就不会有知识，因为这样一来我们就看不出费心竭力去了解一件事物这种做法的意义何在。,"It is not just as though we have something called factual knowledge which may then be distorted by particular interests and judgements, although this is certainly possible; it is also that without particular interests we would have no knowledge at all, because we would not see the point of bothering to get to know anything."
9206,利害关系并非只是危害我们知识的偏见，它构成我们知识的一部分。,"Interests are constitutive of our knowledge, not merely prejudices which imperil it."
9206,认为知识应该“免于价值判断”(value-free)这种主张本身就是一个价值判断。,The claim that knowledge should be 'value-free' is itself a value-judgement.
9207,他广为人知的戏剧手法，即“间离效果”，使人想到俄国形式主义的“陌生化”概念（参见第2章第32-34页中有关部分）。,"His best-known theatrical device, the alienation effect, recalls the Russian Formalists’ concept of ‘defamiliarization’(see Chapter 2, pp. 32-34)."
9207,社会主义现实主义喜欢现实的幻象、形式的统一和“正面的”英雄人物。,"Socialist Realism favoured realistic illusion, formal unity and ‘positive’ heroes."
9207,他把自己的现实主义理论称作“反亚里士多德式的”，意在隐晦地抨击其论敌的理论。,"He called his theory of realism ‘anti-Aristotelian’, a covert way of attacking the theory of his opponents."
9208,每个正确的观点或许都有不伦不类的相似观点，有时是由于对实际情况认识不清而产生的，有时则是由错误的论调所导致的。,"Every true view, perhaps, has its crude analogues, due sometimes to a confused perception of the real state of affairs, sometimes to faulty statement."
9208,往往这些走样的或曲直不分的旁门左道造成了麻烦，正确的观点便不易为人接受。,Often these clumsy or mistaken off-shoots are responsible for the difficulty with which the true view gains acceptance.
9208,好比阴影、反光或回声一样，它们使人莫辨真伪，迷惑不解。,"Like shadows, reflections, or echoes, they obscure and baffle apprehension."
9209,用接受理论的术语来说，读者使本身不过是纸页上一串有序的黑色符号链构成的文学作品“具体化”。,"In the terminology of reception theory, the reader 'concretizes' the literary work, which is in itself no more than a chain of organized black marks on a page."
9209,没有读者连续不断的积极参与，就没有任何文学作品。,"Without this continuous active participation on the reader's part, there would be no literary work at all."
9209,无论接受理论的实践工作看来如何坚实，其实都是由一些“空白”构成的，就像现代物理学中的桌子一样。,"However solid it may seem, any work for reception theory is actually made up of 'gaps', just as tables are for modern physics."
9210,尧斯（Hans Robert Jauss）是德国“接受”理论（Rezeptionästhetik）的重要成员，他赋予读者导向批评一种历史的维度。,"Jauss, an important German exponent of ‘reception’ theory (Rezeption- ästhetik), gave a historical dimension to reader-oriented criticism."
9210,他试图在无视历史的俄国形式主义与无视文本的社会理论之间达成一种妥协。,"He tried to achieve a compromise between Russian Formalism which ignores history, and social theories which ignore the text."
9210,尧斯写作的年代是社会动荡不安的20世纪60年代末期，他和其他一些人要求对德国文学中古老的经典提出质疑，并且说明这种要求完全是合理的。,"Writing during a period of social unrest at the end of the 1960s, Jauss and others wanted to question the old canon of German literature and to show that it was perfectly reasonable to do so."
9211,在讨论树形图时，可以说每一个更高的节点统制着下面所有的范畴。,"In discussing trees, every higher node is said to dominate all the categories beneath it."
9211,VP统制V和NP，还统制Det和N。可以说一个节点直接统制下一级的范畴。VP直接统制V和NP，也就是组成VP的范畴。,"VP immediately dominates V and NP, the categories of which it is composed."
9211,直接被同一节点所统制的范畴是姐妹。,Categories that are immediately dominated by the same node are sisters.
9211,V和NP就是the child found apuppy的短语结构树中的姐妹。,V and NP are sisters in the phrase structure tree of “the child found a puppy.”
9212,最后，应该谈一谈诺姆•乔姆斯基。,"Finally, one should say a word about Noam Chomsky."
9212,尽管某些结构主义者在他们的后期著作中采用了他的某些术语，生成语法学在结构主义的发展过程中却没有发挥什么作用。,"Although a few structuralists have in their later work adopted some of his terms, generative grammar plays no role in the development of structuralism."
9212,它所提供的是一种颇具示范性的方法论的陈述，在我们的讨论中，它的重要性正在这里。,"What it does oﬀer, and what gives it its importance in this discussion, is a methodological statement of exemplary clarity."
9213,从好的方面看，语言学家提出的语法是-种解释理论。这种语法为如下事实提供一种解释（根据上面提到的理想化的思路）：一个说某种语言的人，将以某种特定的方式，而不是任何另外的方式来感知、释译、形成或者运用一段话语。,"In a good sense, the grammar proposed by the linguist is an explanatory theory; it suggests an explanation for the fact that (under the idealization mentioned) a speaker of the language in question will perceive, interpret, form, or use an utterance in certain ways and not in other ways."
9213,人们还可以寻求另外一种更加深层的解释理论。,One can also search for explanatory theories of a deeper sort.
9214,然而，在所有wh短语可移动的语言中（例如：移动疑问短语)，被移动的句子成分会放置到标补语位置。,"However, in all languages with wh movement (i.e., movement of the question phrase), the question element moves to C (complementizer)."
9214,被移动短语的“落点” 是 由 UG 决定的。,The “landing site” of the moved phrase is determined by UG.
9214,在所有wh短语可移动的语言中，会出现一些变化。,"Among the wh movement languages, there is some variation."
9214,在罗曼语中，如意大利语，wh短语的移动和英语一样，但是如果wh短语询问的是介词宾语，那么介词就必须和wh短语一起移动。,"In the Romance languages, such as Italian, the wh phrase moves as in English, but when the wh phrase questions the object of a preposition, the preposition must move together with the wh phrase."
9214,相比之下，在英语中，介词可以被“悬置”（即，可以留在原来的位置上）。,"In English, by contrast, the preposition can be “stranded” (i.e., left behind in its original position)."
9215,有一些句子的谓语里有介词短语，比如：The puppy played in the garden.,Some sentences have a prepositional phrase in the predicate.
9215,(小狗在花园里玩耍。）我们可以利用我们的测试来表明in the garden (在花园里）也是一个成分，方法如下：Where did the puppy play?,"Consider The puppy played in the garden.We can use our tests to show that in the garden is also a constituent, as follows: Where did the puppy play?"
9215,In the garden.(独立性测试） The puppy played there.( 小狗在那里玩。,In the garden (stand alone) The puppy played there.
9215,用类似于代词的词替代） In the garden is where the puppy played.(花园里是小狗玩的地方。,(replacement by a pronoun-like word)In the garden is where the puppy played.
9215,作为一个单位移动） It was in the garden that the puppy played.(小狗在那里玩的[地方]是花园。）,(move as a unit)It was in the garden that the puppy played.
9216,人类语言是从更原始的系统中进化而来的这一假设，被波普在他最近发表的题为“云和钟”的Arther Compton讲演中，以有趣的方式进行了发挥。,"The assumption that human language evolved from more primitive systems is developed in an interesting way by Karl Popper in his recently published Arthur Compton Lecture, “Clouds and Clocks.”"
9216,他试图表明，意志自由和笛卡尔的二元论问题是怎样通过对“进化”的分析而得到解决。,He tries to show how problems of freedom of will and Cartesian dualism can be solved by the analysis of this “evolution.”
9216,我现在并不关心他从这个分析中得出来的哲学结论，而只关心这个基本假设，即存在一种语言进化发展过程，它源于在其他有机体那里发现的较简单的系统。,"I am not concerned now with the philosophical conclusions that he draws from this analysis, but with the basic assumption that there is an evolutionary development of language from simpler systems of the sort that one discovers in other organisms."
9217,她对莎士比亚十四行诗、威契菜的剧作《乡下妻子》、丁尼生、乔治·爱略特和狄更斯等人作品的研究阐明了这类作品历史化与祛历史化的矛盾倾向。,"Her study of Shakespeare’s Sonnets, Wycherley’s play, The Country Wife, Tennyson, George Eliot and Dickens illustrates the paradoxically historicizing and dehistoricizing tendencies of this kind of work."
9217,此书关于哥特式小说是“恐怖主义和同性恋恐慌”的说法也颇有名。,The book is also notable for its discussion of the Gothic as ‘Terrorism and Homosexual Panic’.
9217,她特别（以弗洛伊德理论为依据）探索了“妄想狂是一种精神病，描画了同性恋恐惧症的机制”。,"In particular (building on Freud), she explores the theory that ‘paranoia is the psychosis that makes graphic the mechanisms of homophobia’."
9218,在这些神经官能症背后，精神分析发现植根于个人早期发展中的没有解决的冲突，它们很可能集中在俄狄浦斯阶段。事实上，弗洛伊德把俄狄浦斯情结称为“神经官能症的核心”。,"Behind these neuroses, psychoanalysis discerns unresolved conflicts whose roots run back to the individual's early development, and which are likely to be focused in the Oedipal moment; indeed Freud calls the Oedipus complex the 'nucleus of the neuroses'."
9218,一个病人表现出来的神经官能症状一般总是与他或她的心理发展受到阻碍或“固结”的前俄狄浦斯情结期的某一点有联系的。,"There will usually be a relation between the kind of neurosis a patient displays, and the point in the pre-Oedipal stage at which his or her psychical development became arrested or 'fixated'."
9218,精神分析的目的就是揭示神经官能症的潜因，从而把病人从他的内心冲突中解脱出来，使折磨病人的症状得到缓解。,"The aim of psychoanalysis is to uncover the hidden causes of the neurosis in order to relieve the patient of his or her conflicts, so dissolving the distressing symptoms."
9219,句法规则将词组合成短语，将短语组合成句子。,The rules of syntax combine words into phrases and phrases into sentences.
9219,除此以外，句法规则还规定某一语言的正确词序。,"Among other things, the rules specify the correct word order for a language."
9219,例如，英语的结构是主语-动词-宾语（SVO)。,"For example, English is a Subject–Verb–Object (SVO) language."
9219,英语 例句1合乎语法，因为词都按照正确的顺序排列；例句2不合语法，因为其词序对英语而言不正确。,The English sentence in (1) is grammatical because the words occur in the right order; the sentence in (2) is ungrammatical because the word order is incorrect for English.
9219,（前文说过，句子之前的星号是一项语言学规约，用以表明根据语法规则这个句子不合语法或不合式。）,(Recall that the asterisk or star preceding a sentence is the linguistic convention for indicating that the sentence is ungrammatical or ill-formed according to the rules of the grammar.)
9220,主要根据单一角色的感觉进行视点调节的故事，既可以是第一人称叙述，叙述人讲述他或她想些什么，看到些什么；也可以是第三人称叙述，也就是人们经常说的“第三人称的局限观点”，像小说《梅茜所知道的》里的情景一样。,"Stories focalized primarily through the consciousness of a single character occur both in first person narration, where the narrator tells what he or she thought and observed, and in third person narration, where it is often called ‘third person limited point of view’, as in What Maisie Knew."
9220,观点的局限性会产生靠不住的叙述，也就是我们有一种感觉，即通过聚焦的认识不能或不愿像老练的故事读者们那样去理解事件。,Unreliable narration can result from limitations of point of view-when we gain a sense that the consciousness through which focalization occurs is unable or unwilling to understand the events as competent story-readers would.
9220,以上这些以及其他的叙述和聚焦的不同变化形式对于决定小说的整体效果起了很大的作用。,These and other variations in narration and focalization do much to determine the overall effect of novels.
9221,*unsystem是一个不可能的词，因为英语中没有一条允许前缀un-附加到名词上的规则。,*Unsystem is not a possible word because there is no rule of English that allows un- to be added to nouns.
9221,某家大型软饮料公司通过广告宣传活动推销名为Uncola (“非可乐”）的产品，通过藐视这条语言学规则成功地吸引了人们的注意力。,The large soft-drink company whose ad campaign promoted the Uncola successfully flouted this linguistic rule to capture people’s attention.
9221,在我们的语言能力中，就包括识别可能和不可能的词的能力。,"Part of our linguistic competence includes the ability to recognize possible versus impossible words, like *unsystem and *Uncola."
9221,可能的词是遵循规则的词，不可能的词则不遵循规则。,Possible words are those that conform to the rules; impossible words are those that do not.
9222,一般而言，按发音方式分类，习得语音类别的顺序是：先习得鼻音，然后是滑音、塞音、流音、擦音和塞擦音。,"In general, the order of acquisition of classes of sounds begins with vowels and then goes by manner of articulation for consonants: nasals are acquired first, then glides, stops, liquids, fricatives, and affricates."
9222,按发音部位特征区分的自然类，在儿童语句中也是按次序出现：唇音、软腭音、龈音和腭音。,"Natural classes characterized by place of articulation features also appear in children’s utterances according to a more or less ordered series: labials, velars, alveolars, and palatals."
9222,所以，mama是许多儿童早期习得的一个词，这并不奇怪。,It is not surprising that mama is an early word for many children.
9223,非鼻塞音，擦音，还有塞擦音组成一个大类，叫作阻音。,"The non-nasal stops, the fricatives, and the affricates form a major class of sounds called obstruents."
9223,发非鼻塞音和塞擦音时气流完全阻断，发擦音是部分阻碍。,"The airstream may be fully obstructed, as in non-nasal stops and affricates, or nearly fully obstructed, as in the production of fricatives."
9223,擦音是通音性阻音。,
9223,发擦音时气流不间断地流出口腔，虽然口腔内的阻碍足以造成构成此类音特点的摩擦。,
9224,法语不是重音语言，每个音节的响度、音高和长短都大致相同。,"French is not a stress-timed language.The syllables have approximately the same loudness, length, and pitch."
9224,它是一种音节语言。,"It is a ""syllable-timed"" language."
9224,英国人说法语常常会重读一些音节，结果法国人就听到了一种“带英语重读口音”的法语。,"When native English speakers attempt to speak French, they often stress syllables, so that native French speakers hear French with ""an English accent."""
9225,迈克尔·布利斯托尔的《狂欢节与戏剧：文艺复兴时期的英格兰平民文化和作者结构》（1985）采纳巴赫金的“狂欢节”概念，试图提出一种更为开放的文化产出模式。,Michael Bristol’s Carnival and Theater: Plebeian Culture and the Structure of Authority in Renaissance England (1985) used Bakhtin’s concept of ‘Carnival’ in order to introduce a more open model of cultural production.
9225,他提出，布林格拉特和多利莫尔没有能够看出伊丽莎白时代平民文化的活力与力量。,He argued that Greenblatt and Dollimore fail to recognize the vitality and power of popular culture in the Elizabethan period.
9225,巴赫金把“狂欢节”看作与官方文化相对应的“第二种文化”，这种文化在整个中世纪与现代早期由平民大众所推行。,"Bakhtin regards ‘Carnival’ as a ‘second culture’, which was opposed to the official culture, and which was carried on by the common people throughout the middle ages and well into the early modern period."
9226,弥尔顿之后，英国文学的敏感性继续分裂为独立的两半：有些诗人能想而不能感，有些诗人能感而不能想。,"After Milton, the English sensibility continued to dissociate itself into separate halves: some poets could think but not feel, while others could feel but not think."
9226,英国文学堕落成为浪漫主义和维多利亚风格：“诗的天才”、“个性”和“内心之光”这些异端邪说此时已经根深蒂固，而所有这些都是一个业已丧失集体信仰和堕入漫无目标的个人主义的社会的无政府学说。,"English literature degenerated into Romanticism and Victorianism: by now the heresies of 'poetic genius', 'personality' and the 'inner light' were firmly entrenched, all anarchic doctrines of a society which had lost collective belief and declined into an errant individualism."
9226,直到T·S·艾略特出现，英国文学才开始恢复。,It was not until the appearance of T. S. Eliot that English literature began to recuperate.
9227,"“乐趣”和“满足""在此处都是不恰当的宇眼。",Both ‘enjoyment’ and ‘satisfaction’ are unsuitable terms in this connection.
9227,应该认识到有个遗憾的语言隔阂。,An unfortunate linguistic gap must be recognized.
9227,—个活动的充分发挥一般就是它自身的满足。而且，我们从下文可以看到，可能伴随它的快乐是派生性和偶然性的。,"The full exercise of an activity is commonly its own ‘satisfaction’, and, as we shall see later, what pleasure may accompany it is derivative and incidental."
9228,总之，类推、模仿、强化都不能解释儿童语言发展，因为它们所依据的(隐性或者显性的)假设是，儿童习得的是一个句子或形式的集合，而不是语法规则的集合。,"Analogy, imitation, and reinforcement cannot account for language development because they are based on the (implicit or explicit) assumption that what the child acquires is a set of sentences or forms rather than a set of grammatical rules."
9228,那些假设“语言习得要依赖特意组织的言语输入”的理论过分强调环境的作用，而忽视儿童建立语法的能力。,Theories that assume that acquisition depends on a specially structured input also place too much emphasis on the environment rather than on the grammar-making abilities of the child.
9228,这,
9229,类推变化指的是规则的泛化，通过它可以使得需要个别学习和记忆、例外或不规则的语素数目减少。,Analogic change is a generalization of rules that reduces the number of excep- tional or irregular morphemes.
9229,正是通过对plow(犁，单数)/plows(犁，复数)以及vow(誓言，单数)/vows(誓言，复数)的类推，人们才先开始用cows(母牛，复数)作为cow(母牛，单数)的复数，代替原来的kine。,It was by analogy to plow/plows and vow/vows that speakers started saying cows as the plural of cow instead of the earlier plural kine.
9229,事实上，复数规则变得更加泛化了。,"In effect, the plural rule became more general."
9230,这就是人们为什么评说“理论'而不是讲那些具体的论 述。,This is why people talk about ‘theory’ and not just about particular theories.
9230,介绍理论比较好的办法是讨论共同存在的问题和共有的主张；讨论那些重大的辩论，但不要把一个“学派”置于另一个“学派”的对立面；讨论各种流派内的明显不同。,"To introduce theory, it is better to discuss shared questions and claims than to survey theoretical schools.It is preferable to discuss important debates that do not oppose one ‘school’ to another but may mark salient divisions within movements."
9230,这要比概栝论述不同理论学派的方法好。,
9231,研究语言怎样变化、有哪些种变化、为什么变化的语言学分支被称为历史比较语言学。,"The branch of linguistics that deals with how languages change, what kinds of changes occur, and why they occurred is called historical and comparative linguistics."
9231,它是“历史的”，因为它研究特定语言的历史。它是“比较的，因为它研究语言之间的关系。,It is “historical” because it deals with the history of particular languages; it is “comparative” because it deals with relations among languages.
9232,Jennifer是单数，你说Jennifer is 而不说Jennifer are。,"""Jennifer"" is singular; you say ""Jennifer is"", not ""Jennifer are""."
9232,代词She也是单数，你说She is而不说She are。,"The pronoun ""She"" is singular; you say ""She is"", not ""She are""."
9232,但是把She and Jennifer连接在一起时就不是单数而是复数，你说She and Jennifer are而不说She and Jennifer is，所以一个连词可以依它所包含的代词而有不同的数，那么为什么它里面的代词一定要有相同的主法格呢?（Give A1 Got l and l a chance?）,"But the conjunction ""She and Jennifer"" is not singular, it's plural; you say ""She and Jennifer are"", not ""She and Jennifer is"".So if a conjunction can have a different grammatical number from the pronouns inside it (""She and Jennifer are""), why must it have the same grammatical case as the pronouns inside it (""Give Al Gore and I a chance"")?"
9233,作为语言习得的一种模型，连接主义面临一些严重的挑战。,"As a model of language acquisition, connectionism faces some serious chal- lenges."
9233,这个模型假设儿童所处环境中的语言有很具体的特性。,The model assumes that the language of the child’s environment has very specific properties.
9233,然而儿童实际接收的言语输入的调查表明，这一假设不符合事实。,"However, investigation of the input that children actually receive shows that it is not consistent with those assumptions."
9234,列维-斯特劳斯在他的论原始人思维的两本重要著作，《图腾制度>)(1962年）和《野蛮人的思维:K1962年）中对“零敲碎打”这一术语作了如下定义。,The term bricolage is defined in his two major works on the primitive mind; Totemism (1962) and The Savage Mind (1962).
9234,它指的是所谓“原始人”没有文化、没有技术的思想赖以对周围世界作出反应的手段。,"It refers to the means by which the non-literate, non-technical mind of so-called ‘primitive’ man  responds  to  the  world  around  him."
9234,这个过程包含一种“具体科学”（和我们“文明的”“抽象的”科学相对立>。这种科学远非缺乏逻辑，事实上，它以和我们不同的逻辑，仔细而精确地把这个丰富多釆的物质界的一分一毫都组合成结构，加以分类和排列。,"The  process  involves  a  ‘science  of  the  concrete’  (as  opposed  to  our  ‘civilized’  science  of  the ‘abstract’) which, far from lacking logic, in fact carefully and precisely orders, classifies and arranges into structures the minutiae of the physical world in all their profusion by means of a ‘logic’ which is not our own."
9235,但这还不是全部。,But that's not all.
9235,我们有领属关系类名词短语，例如（ Melissa’s garden）梅丽莎的花园、the girl’s shoes（这个女孩的鞋）和the man's hat（这个男人的帽子）。,"We have possessive noun phrases such as Melissa’s garden, the girl’s shoes, and the man's hat.In these structures the possessor NP (e.g., Melissa’s, the girl’s, etc."
9235,"在这些结构中, 领有者名词短语 (如梅丽莎、女孩等) 的起限定作用, 它进一步明确了它的姊妹名词。",) functions as a determiner in that it further specifies its sister noun.
9236,"流音和鼻音也有成音节性，如dazzle[daezl](耀眼）, faker[fekr](伪装者），rhythm[rɪðm](节奏)，button[bʌtn](按钮）([l]，[r]，[m]，[n]下的小竖杠是表不成音节的附加符号）。","Liquids and nasals can also be syllabic, as shown by the words dazzle [dӕzl]̩ , faker [fekr]̩ , rhythm [rɪðm̩], and button [bʌtn]̩ .(The diacritic mark under the [l]̩ , [r]̩ , [m̩], and [n]̩ is the notation for syllabic.)"
9236,"在这几个成音节的流音和鼻音前插入一个混元音[ə]也显示出这是分离的音节， 即这四个词可以分别标为[dӕzəl]，[fekər],[rɪðəm],[bʌtən]。","Placing a schwa [ə] before the syllabic liquid or nasal also shows that these are separate syllables.The four words could be written as [dӕzəl], [fekər], [rɪðəm], and [bʌtən]."
9236,本书就使用这种标写法。,We will use this transcription.
9236,同样，bird，verb等词中的元音有时标写为成音节的[r]，即[brd] 和[vrb]。,"Similarly, the vowel sound in words like bird and verb are sometimes written as a syllabic r, [brd̩ ] and [vrb̩ ]."
9236,为一致起见，我们用混元音来标写[bərd]和[vərb]。这是用混元音来表示重读元音的仅有的词例。,For consistency we shall transcribe these words using the schwa—[bərd] and [vərb]—the only instances where a schwa represents a stressed vowel.
9237,俄底浦斯的叙事结构取了第一种形式：他破坏了杀父和乱伦的禁忌，因而自我惩罚。,"The  Oedipus  narrative  has  the  first  structure:  he  violates  the  prohibition against patricide and incest, and punishes himself."
9237,托多洛夫总括了普洛普、格雷马斯和其他学者的论述。,"The  work  of  Tzvetan  Todorov  is  a  summation  of  Propp,  Greimas  and others."
9237,语言的所有句法规则都在他们的叙事幌子下获得了重新陈述主语宾语的行动者法则、谓语表语的表述法则、形容词和副词的功能法则、语气和语体等等。,"The syntactic rules of language are restated in their narrative guise– rules  of  agency,  predication,  adjectival  and  verbal  functions,  mood  and aspect, and so on."
9238,沃尔夫的文章一发表后，心理语言学家列能伯格和布朗就指出他的论点中的两个不合理地方。,"As soon as Whorf's articles appeared, the psycholinguists Eric Lenneberg and Roger Brown pointed out two non sequiturs in his argument."
9238,第一就是沃尔夫并没有真正去研究阿帕契人，没存任何证据说他真的碰过阿帕契人;他只研究过阿帕契语的文法，所以这使得他的论点变得拐弯抹角—阿帕契人说话说得不一样，所以他们思考不一样。,"First, Whorf did not actually study any Apaches; it is not clear that he ever met one.His assertions about Apache psychology are based entirely on Apache grammar ——making his argument circular.Apaches speak differently, so they must think differently."
9238,我们怎么知道他们思考是不一样的？,How do we know that they think differently?
9238,只要去听他们讲话的方式就晓得了！,Just listen to the way they speak!
9239,"动词不仅能决定一个句子中论元的数量, 还可以限制其主语和补足语的语义特征。","The verb not only determines the number of arguments in a sentence, but it also limits the semantic properties of both its subject and its complements."
9239,例如，find和sleep要求（s-选择）有生主语。,"For example, find and sleep require (s-select) animate subjects."
9239,那个著名的例句colorless green ideas sleep foriously之所以在语义上是 异常的，是因为“思想”（不论是否有颜色）不是有生的。,The well-known colorless green ideas sleep furiously is semantically anomalous because ideas (colorless or not) are not animate.
9240,"语言本能的第二个原则是以有限的中介去做无限的应用, 这是洪堡特所说的话。","The second trick behind the language instinct is captured in a phrase from Wilhelm Von Humboldt that presaged Chomsky: language ""makes infinite use of finite media."""
9240,我们知道这个不足为奇的狗咬人和新闻的人咬狗之间的差异，仅在字序。,"We know the difference between the forgettable Dog bites man and the newsworthy Man bites dog because of the order in which do man, and bites are combined."
9240,也就是说，我们用一种码去翻译字序和思维之间的关系。,"That is, we use a code to translate between orders of words and combinations of thoughts."
9241,同样，也有些句子总是假的。,"Similarly, some sentences are always false."
9241,这类句子称为矛盾。,These are called contradictions.
9241,矛盾句的例子如“圆圈是方的”或“单身汉是已婚的”。,Examples of contradictions are sentences like Circles are square or A bachelor is married.
9242,如果其中一个句子衍推另一个句子的否定，它们就是矛盾的。,Two sentences are contradictory if one entails the negation of the other.
9242,比如说，“杰克活着”衍推“杰克死了”的否定，也就是说“杰克没有死”。,"For instance, Jack is alive entails the negation of Jack is dead, namely Jack is not dead."
9242,同样地，“杰克死了”衍推“杰克活着”的否定，也就是说“杰克没有活着”。,"Similarly, Jack is dead entails the negation of Jack is alive, namely Jack is not alive."
9243,心理语言学家辛格顿和纽波特曾经研究过一个九岁的重度听障的男孩西蒙。,"The psycholinguists Jenny Singleton and Elissa Newport have studied a nine-year-old profoundly deaf boy, to whom they gave the pseudonym Simon, and his parents, who are also deaf."
9243,西蒙和他的双亲都是聋人，但是他的父母却是到十五六岁青春期的晚期才学手语，因此，他们的手语学得不好。,"Simon's parents did not acquire sign language until the late ages of   een and sixteen, and as a result they acquired it badly."
9243,在美国手势语言中，你可以把一个短语移到句子的前面或后面，只要加上一个前置或语尾的标记即可，就跟很多其他的语言—样。在美国手势语言中，把眉毛扬起或把下巴抬起都表示这是句子的主题。,"In ASL, as in many languages, one can move a phrase to the front of a sentence and mark it with a pre x or su x (in ASL, raised eyebrows and a li ed chin) to indicate that it is the topic of the sentence."
9244,若干项研究调查了在不同年龄接触美国手语（ASL）的失聪手语使用者习得这种语言的情况。,Several studies have investigated the acquisition of American Sign Language (ASL) among deaf signers exposed to the language at different ages.
9244,尽管所有研究对象使用手语都已超过20年，但从出生到6岁期间接受ASL输入的早学者，在打出和理解复杂手势和手语句方面，比在12岁以后才接触ASL的晚学者要出色得多。,"Early learners who received ASL input from birth and up to six years of age did much better in the production and comprehension of complex signs and sign sentences than late learners who were not exposed to ASL until after the age of twelve, even though all of the subjects in these studies had used sign for more than twenty years."
9244,然而，在词汇量或词序知识方面他们的差异却很小。,"There was little difference, however, in vocabulary or knowledge of word order."
9245,让我们可能感到遗憾的是，在过去三十年旨在阐明种种理论运动的过程中，这种“实用批评”己经丧尽尊严， 尽管如此，它的功德却是无法抹杀的。它鼓励学界重视文本细读，通过理智和历史的抽象，确立了一种在教室中进行文学研究的民主化精神，在这种民主化氛围中，几乎每一个人都可以在平等的基础上面对一个“盲”文本（这一点在稍后讨论“美国新批评”时还要论及）。,"Its virtues were, however-and we may yet come to regret its obloquy in the demystifying theoretical initiatives of the past thirty years–that it encouraged attentive close reading of texts and, in its intellectual and historical abstraction, a kind of democratization of literary study in the classroom, in which nearly everyone was placed on an equal footing in the face of a ‘blind’ text–a point we will re-emphasize in the context of American New Criticism."
9245,1929 年，理查兹离开剑桥，随后定居哈佛，他的影响，特别是通过《实用批评》产生的影响，实实在在地支撑了美国当时正在向同样方向发展的国内学术潮流。,"Indeed Richards left Cambridge in 1929, later settling at Harvard University, and his influence, particularly through Practical Criticism, substantially underpinned native developments in the States which were moving in similar directions."
9246,对于康德和其他理论家来说，美学对象具有“无目的的目的性”。,"Aesthetic objects, for Kant and other theorists, have a ‘purposiveness without purpose’."
9246,它们的建构具有一种目的性，也就是使其各个部分协调一致以实现某个目的。,There is a purposiveness to their construction: they are made so that their parts will work together towards some end.
9246,但这个目的即为艺术作品本身，是蕴含在作品当中的愉悦，或者是由作品引起的愉悦，而不是某种外在目的。,"But the end is the work of art itself, pleasure in the work or pleasure occasioned by the work, not some external purpose."
9247,英语中paparazzo（狗仔）一词指“像狗一样追踪名人的自由职业摄影师”。这个名祖来自电影《甜蜜的生活》中一个新闻摄影师角色——帕帕拉佐（Paparazzo)先生。1997年威尔士王妃戴安娜因为被paparazzi(狗仔队，复数）紧追不舍，结果在一场致命的汽车事故中丧生，在此之前这个词还很少有人知道。,"The word paparazzo, “a freelance photographer who doggedly pursues celebrities,” was a little-known word until the death of Princess Diana in 1997, who was hounded by paparazzi (plural) before her fatal automobile accident.This eponym comes from the news photographer character Signor Paparazzo in the motion picture La Dolce Vita."
9248,例如，大脑的布罗卡区受损的病人，可能患上布罗卡失语症，它常造 成患者的句法障碍和语法缺失。,"For example, lesions in the part of the brain called Broca’s area may suffer from Broca’s aphasia, which results in impaired syntax and agrammatism."
9248,韦尼克区受损的病人，则可能患上韦尼克失语症，患者说流利但语义异常的话语。更严重的是杂乱性失语症，患者说无意义的语言形式，因此无从理解。,"Damage to Wernicke’s area may result in Wernicke’s aphasia, in which fluent speakers produce semantically anomalous utterances, or even worse, jargon aphasia, in which speakers produce nonsense forms that make their utterance uninterpretable."
9248,对其他部位的损伤可能引起命名不能症，是一种患者有找词困难的失语症。,"Damage to yet different areas can produce anomia, a form of aphasia in which the patient has word-finding difficulties."
9249,这表明受试者在“命名任务”中能够同时做两件事情。,This suggests that people can do two different things in the naming task.
9249,他们在自己的心理词库中查找这个符号串，如果能够找到（即该符号串是真词），那么他们就能根据储存在词库中的音系表达式发音。,"They can look for the string in their mental lexicon, and if they find it (i.e., if it is a real word), they can pronounce the stored phonological representation for it."
9249,"另外，他们凭借对某些字母或字母序列（比如gh, oe等）最常见的发音方式的知识，也能够“把它念出来”。","They can also “sound it out,” using their knowledge of how certain letters or letter sequences (e.g., “gh,” “oe”) are most commonly pronounced."
9249,要找到并不存在的词的发音，后者显然是唯一的方法。,The latter is obviously the only way to come up with a pronunciation for a nonexisting word.
9250,热奈特的论文《叙述的世界》（1966）对叙述作了全面的论述，迄今为止，还没有看到比这篇更好的论文。,Genette’s essay on ‘Frontiers of Narrative’ (1966) provided an overview of the problems of narration which has not been bettered.
9250,他通过三个二元对立的命题来思考叙述的理论问题。,He considers the problem of narrative theory by exploring three binary oppositions.
9250,这一个是亚里士多德《诗学》中提出的“叙述与模仿”（diegesis and mimesis；也即英语中的narration and representation）的二元对立，它预设了简单叙述（作者以自己的声音讲述）与直接模仿（作者以一个人物的声音讲述）之间的区别。,"The first, ‘diegesis and mimesis’ (narrative and representation), occurs in Aristotle’s Poetics and presupposes a distinction between simple narrative (what the author says in his or her own voice as author) and direct imitation (when the author speaks in the person of a character)."
9251,模仿的倾向——将艺术解释为基本上是对世间的模仿——很可能是最原始的美学理论，但“米迈悉斯”（mimesis）被第一次记录在柏拉图对话里时，其含义已经相当繁杂了。苏格拉底说，会话、诗歌、音乐、舞蹈、雕塑，都是模仿。,"The mimetic orientation—the explanation of art as essentially an imitation of aspects of the universe—was probably the most primitive aesthetic theory，but mimesis is no simple concept by the time it makes its first recorded appearance in the dialogues of Plato, The arts of painting, poetry, music， dancing, and sculpture, Socrates says, are all imitations."
9251,"""模仿""是一个关键语词，表示两项事物和他们之间的某种对应。","Imitation is a relational term, signifying two items and some correspondence between them."
9252,黎奥塔则认为，“真理诉求”和这样一种假设的全球化历史的共识是压抑的、站不住脚的。,In Lyotard’s view the ‘truth claims’ and assumed consensus of such a universalizing history are repressive and untenable.
9252,去掉了这个根据，“后现代”科学就追求能够获得最佳表现的技术与商业目的 ：由新的、可以使信息成为政治数量的电脑技术加强的变化。,"Deprived of these premises, ‘postmodern’ science pursues the technical and commercial aims of optimal performance: a change reinforced by new, computerized technologies which make information a political quantity."
9252,然而，这种技术专家治国的秩序与那种质疑“标准科学”模式的内在实验驱动力总是格格不入。,"However, this technocratic order is at odds with an internal experimental drive which questions the paradigms of ‘normal science’."
9253,雅各布逊是莫斯科语言学小组的领袖，这个形式主义者的小团体成立于1915年。1920年雅各布逊移居布拉格，成为捷克结构主义的主要理论家之一。,"Jakobson was leader of the Moscow Linguistic Circle, a Formalist group founded in 1915, and in 1920 migrated to Prague to become one of the major theoreticians of Czech structuralism."
9253,布拉格语言学小组成立于1926年，它一直存在到第二次世界大战的爆发，雅各布逊后来再次迁居，这一次他去了美国。第二次世界大战期间，他在那里遇到法国人类学家克劳·罗维·斯特劳斯。他们的相识是一个知识的联系，大部分现代结构主义就由此发展而来。,"The Prague Linguistic Circle was founded in 1926, and survived until the outbreak of the Second World War.Jakobson later migrated once more, this time to the United States, where he encountered the French anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss during the Second World War, an intellectual relationship out of which much of modern structuralism was to develop."
9254,这一发展的征象出现在“性别研究”（Gender Studies）的崛起与“男同性恋研究”（Gay Studies）和新兴的“人的研究”（Men's Studies）的对话中。“人的研究”建立在女性主义与男同性恋理论的基础上，旨在对人的性行为与生活方式加以批评和重建。,"Signs of this development have since appeared in the academic rise of Gender Studies and the dialogues in Gay Studies with the emerging discipline of Men’s Studies, which aims to build on feminism and gay theory so as to provide a critique and reconstruction of men’s sexualities and lifestyles."
9254,对于学术界的这些倾向一些人是心怀忧虑与反对的。在一些领域，男同性恋理论与女性主义仍有争议，甚至有敌对的情形。,"There has been anxiety over and opposition to both these tendencies, and there remains in some quarters an unsettled, even antagonistic, relationship between gay theory and feminism."
9255,一些形态规则，尤其是曲折成分，具有能产性，意思是说它们能够加以自由运用，从而将清单中的自由语素和黏着语素组成新词。,"We have noted that some morphological processes, inflection in particular, are productive, meaning that they can be used freely to form new words from the list of free and bound morphemes."
9255,后缀-able似乎是这样一个语素，可以和任何动词并联派生出形容词，而其语义则是动词语义和后缀-able语义两者的结合，意思差不多可以表示为“可……的” ，例如：accept + able (可接受的），laugh + able (可笑的），pass + able (过得去的），change + able (可变的），breathe + able (可以呼吸的），adapt + able (能适应的，可改编的）等 等 。后缀-able还被赋予了“适合做”或者“适合被……”的语义。,"Among derivational morphemes, the suffix -able can be conjoined with any verb to derive an adjective with the meaning of the verb and the meaning of -able, which is something like “able to be” as in accept + able, laugh + able, pass + able, change + able, breathe + able, adapt + able, and so on."
9255,我们发现-able可以附缀到新产生的动词上面，构成downloadable (可下载的）和faxable( 可传真的）这样的词，这说明这条规则具有能产性。,The productivity of this rule is illustrated by the fact that we find -able affixed to new verbs such as downloadable and faxable.
9256,只有注意到一首诗的成分(即符号)往往与正常的语法和正常的再现的不同，我们才开始真正对这首诗有所反应。诗歌似乎只是间接地确定其意义，并通过这样的方式“威胁文学对现实的再现”。,A true response starts by noticing that the elements (signs) in a poem often appear to depart from normal grammar or normal representation: the poem seems to be establishing significance only indirectly and in doing so ‘threatens the literary representation of reality’.
9256,理解诗的“意义”，只需要普通的语言能力，然而要应对诗歌阅读中经常碰到的”不合语法规范之处“，则需要“文学能力”。（欲更多了解这一术语，参看第4章第75-77页有关卡勒的部分 )。,"It requires only ordinary linguistic competence to understand the poem’s ‘meaning’, but the reader requires ‘literary competence’ (for more on this term, see Culler, Chapter 4, pp. 75–77) to deal with the frequent ‘ungrammaticalities’ encountered in reading a poem."
9257,诗歌的随心所欲性中包括了它对理论家自古典时代以来所谓的“崇高”的强烈追求：这是一种超越人类理解能力的关系，激发一神敬畏或强烈的情感，给说话人一种超越人类的感觉。,"The extravagance of poetry includes its aspiration to what theorists since classical times have called the ‘sublime’: a relation to what exceeds human capabilities of understanding, provokes awe or passionate intensity, gives the speaker a sense of something beyond the human."
9257,不过这种超验的热烈追求是与修辞手段相联系的，比如呼语法，一种对实际不在场的听众讲话的修辞手段；拟人法，把人类的特点赋予非人类的事物；活现法，让无生命的事物具备讲话的能力。,"But this transcendent aspiration is linked to rhetorical figures such as apostrophe, the trope of addressing what is not an actual listener, personification, the attribution of human qualities to what is not human, and prosopopoeia, the granting of speech to inanimate objects."
9257,诗句的最强烈的情感是怎样与这些修辞手段相联系的呢？,How can the highest aspirations of verse be linked to such rhetorical devices?
9258,"英语中的 cock-a-doodle-doo是表示公鸡打鸣的拟声词,而芬兰语公鸡打鸣是 kukkokiekuu。在http://www.georgetown.edu/cball/animals/animals.html®这一网址，你可以找到很多语言模仿几十种动物叫声的拟声词。","In English cock-a-doodle-doo is an onomatopoeic word whose meaning is the crow of a rooster, whereas in Finnish the rooster’s crow is kukkokiekuu."
9258,如果你想知道土耳其语模仿火鸡叫声的拟声词，你可以去那里查找。这个词是 glu-glu。,Forget gobble gobble when you’re in Istanbul; a turkey in Turkey goes glu-glu.
9259,一个潜在的词由音位构成遵守该语言音位配列规则的序列。,A possible word contains phonemes in sequences that obey the phonotactic constraints of the language.
9259,一个事实上出现的词，是一个潜在的词和某个意义的结合。,"An actual, occurring word is the union of a possible word with a meaning."
9259,没有意义的可能词有时候叫作无意义词，有时也指词库中的偶然缺位，或词汇缺位。,"Possible words without meaning are sometimes called nonsense words and are also referred to as accidental gaps in the lexicon, or lexical gaps."
9260,到现在为止我们所考察的派生例子都是只运用了一条音系规则。复数和过去时的例子有些不一样，那是一条规则中的两个部分。,"All the examples of derivations we have so far considered show the application of just one phonological rule, except the plural and past-tense rules, which are actually one rule with two parts."
9260,但是，必定还有数条规则作用于一个词的情况。,"In any event, it is common for more than one rule to apply to a word."
9261,派生语素有明确的语义内容，在这个意义上它们跟实义词一样，只不过它们本身不是词，前面我们已经看到，把一个派生语素加到一个词基上，就会增加语义。,"Derivational morphemes have clear semantic content.In this sense they are like content words, except that they are not words.As we have seen, when a derivational morpheme is added to a base, it adds meaning."
9261,派生词所属的语法类也可能与原词不同，后缀-able和-ly就是这样。,"The derived word may also be of a different grammatical class than the original word, as shown by suffixes such as -able and -ly."
9261,"如果一个动词加上后缀-able,结果就得到一个形容词，例如desire+able(可取的)。","When a verb is suffixed with -able, the result is an adjective, as in “desire + able”."
9262,此外，亚里士多德在分析美术的同时，也根据模仿对象、模仿媒介和完成模仿的方式——如戏剧的、叙述的或混合的——对艺术作了进一步的区分。,"Furthermore, in his analysis of the fine arts, Aristotle at once introduces supplementary distinctions according to the objects imitated the medium of imitation and the manner—dramatic, narrative, or mixed, for example—in which the imitation is accomplished."
9262,他逐一利用了对象、手段、方式上的这些特征从而得以将诗歌与其它艺术样式区分开来，接着再把诗歌划分成各种样式，例如史诗和戏剧、悲剧和喜剧。,"By successive exploitadon of these distinctions in object, means, and manner, he is able first to distinguish poetry from other kinds of art?and then to differentiate the various poetic genres, such as epic and drama, tragedy and comedy."
9262,他在着重分析悲剧时，又以同样的方法把整体区分为情节、性格、思想等成分。因此，亚里士多德的批评反认为艺术就是艺术，与政治、人生、道德无关，而且认为诗歌就是诗歌，认为每一种诗都有适合其特性的标准。,"When he focuses on the genre of tragedy, the same analytic instrument is applied to the discrimination of the parts constituting the individual whole: plot, character, thought, and so on, Aristotle's criticism, therefore, is not only criticism of art as art, independent of statesmanship being, and morality but also of poetry as poetry, and of each kind of poem by the criteria appropriate to its particular nature."
9263,皮钦语发挥着有用的功能。,Pidgins also serve a useful function.
9263,例如，一个人能在六个月内学会以英语为基础的皮钦语，足以开始接受各种半职业性的培训。,"For example, it is possible to learn an English-based pidgin well enough in six months to begin many kinds of semiprofessional training."
9263,如果为了同样的目的学习英语则需要花费10倍的时间。,Learning English for the same purpose might take ten times as long.
9263,在一个存在很多种相互难以理解的语言的地区，皮钦语在将种种异质文化统一起来的过程中发挥着极为重要的作用。,"In areas with many mutually unintelligible languages, a pidgin can play a vital role in unifying people of different cultures and ethnicities."
9264,我们也知道婴儿的脑在生下来后改变很大。,And we know that babies' brains do change considerably after birth.
9264,在出生之前，所有的神经细胞已形成，都移走到它们被指定的位置上去了。,"Before birth, virtually all the neurons (nerve cells) are formed, and they migrate into their proper locations in the brain."
9264,但是头的大小、脑的重量及大脑皮质（灰质）（在出生的头一年还继续不断快速地生长）的厚度，在这里可以找到支援心智运算的突触。,"But head size, brain weight, and thickness of the cerebral cortex (gray matter), where the synapses (junctions) subserving mental computation are found, continue to increase rapidly in the year after birth."
9265,语言偏侧化到大脑左半球的过程，始于生命的早期。,Lateralization of language to the left hemisphere is a process that begins very early in life.
9265,妊娠26周胎儿的大脑左半球中，韦尼克区就清晰可见了。,Wernicke’s area is visibly distinctive in the left hemisphere of the fetus by the twenty-sixth gestational week.
9265,一周大的婴儿大脑左半球显示出对语言有较强的电反应，而其右半球则对音乐有较强的电反应。,Infants as young as one week old show a greater electrical response in the left hemisphere to language and in the right hemisphere to music.
9265,最近对5至12个月大的失聪婴儿和听力正常婴儿的研究表明，婴儿的咿呀语主要出现在大脑左半球。,A recent study videotaped the mouths of babies between the ages of five and twelve months when they were smiling and when they were babbling in syllables (producing sequences like mamama or gugugu).
9266,这样的一个清单是有用的，但计算机好像是在记忆而不是在断定词的发音。该清单中也包含了很大比例的，注入（诸如）ough这样的条目。,"Such a list is helpful—it is like memorizing rather than figuring out the pronunciations—and encompasses a large percentage of items, including the ough words."
9266,这是词层面上的拼接合成的基础。,This is the basis of word-level concatenative synthesis.
9267,我们不妨以爱迪生关于天才的区分来开始我们的讨论。这个区分并非由他首创，他只是使这个区分更趋鲜明、更加普及。他把天才分为生就的天才——就是“自然天才”——和造就的天才。,"We may begin with Addison's distinction, which he did not invent, but sharpened and popularized, between the genius who is born一 the ‘natural genius’一 and the genius who is made."
9267,自然的天才人物有荷马、平达、写作旧约的那些诗人和莎士比亚，他们是“人中奇才，只凭借自然才华，不需求助于任何技艺和学识，就创造出荣耀当时、流芳后世的作品”。,"Natural geniuses, a class comprising Homer, Pindar, the Old Testament poets, and Shakespeare, are ‘the prodigies of mankind, who by the mere strength of natural parts, and without any assistance of art or learning, have produced works that were the delight of their own times, and the wonder of posterity.'"
9268,这种因说话者的社会境况不同而产生的语言差异被称为社会语言变项。,Linguistic differences of this sort that vary with the social situation of the speaker are termed sociolinguistic variables.
9268,例如，使用诸如双重否定这样的非标准形式常常与种族自尊心联系在一起，而后者则是社会语境的一部分。,"For example, the use of nonstandard forms like double negation is often associated with pride of ethnicity, which is part of the social context."
9268,许多说奇卡诺英语的人（和说AAE的人）都能说两种方言；他们会根据社会情况使用奇卡诺英语（或AAE）或者SAE。,"Many Chicano speakers (and speakers of AAE) are bidialectal; they can use either ChE (or AAE) or SAE, depending on the social situation."
9269,最近的神经语言学研究开始显示词汇判定技术的局限性。,Recent neurolinguistic research is showing the limits of the lexical decision technique.
9269,现在人们可以测量受试者做词汇判定实验时的脑电活动，并把脑反应的模式与反应时间的模式进行比较（该技术与第二章提到的事件相 关脑电位ERP相似）。,"It is now possible to measure electrical brain activity in subjects while they perform a lexical decision experiment, and compare the patterns in brain responses to patterns in RTs.(The technique is similar to the event-related brain potentials mentioned in chapter 2.)"
9269,这类实验得出的结论与反应时间数据相冲突。,Such experiments have provided results that directly conflict with the RT data.
9269,例如，对脑活动的测量表明成对的动词形式（如“教”的原型和过去式teach/taught)在词汇提取的早期阶段发生启动，然而这类成对动词在词汇判定的反应时间上却没有发生启动。,"For example, measures of brain activity show priming to pairs of verb forms such as teach/taught during the early stages of lexical access, whereas such pairs do not show priming in lexical decision RTs."
9269,这是因为词汇判定涉及若干个处理阶段，早期阶段中的模式可能被其后阶段中的不同模式所遮蔽。,"This is because lexical decision involves several stages of processing, and patterns in early stages may be obscured by different patterns in later stages."
9269,相比之下，脑测量则是持续进行的，因此允许研究者对处理过程的早期和晚期分开进行测量。,"Brain measures, by contrast, are taken continuously and therefore allow researchers to separately measure early and later processes."
9270,一些语言还有外接缀，指的是在同一个词基语素的开头和末尾附加上的语素，有时候也被称为非连续语素。,"Some languages have circumfixes, morphemes that are attached to a base morpheme both initially and finally.These are sometimes called discontinuous morphemes."
9270,在美国俄克拉荷马州有一种属于印第安土著马斯科吉语系的奇卡索语，词的否定形式 通过前缀ik-和后缀-o共同组成。,"In Chickasaw, a Muskogean language spoken in Oklahoma, the negative is formed with both a prefix ik- and the suffix -o."
9270,在加上表示否定的后缀之前，肯定形式末尾的元音会先脱落。,The final vowel of the affirmative is dropped before the negative suffix is added.
9271,通往潜意识的捷径是梦。,The 'royal road' to the unconscious is dreams.
9271,梦特许我们一瞥潜意识的工作。,Dreams allow us one of our few privileged glimpses of it at work.
9271,在弗洛伊德看来，梦基本上是潜意识欲望的象征实现；它们采取象征形式是因为，这些内容如果被直接表现出来，那就足以惊醒我们。,Dreams for Freud are essentially symbolic fulfilments of unconscious wishes; and they are cast in symbolic form because if this material were expressed directly then it might be shocking and disturbing enough to wake us up.
9271,为了让我们获得某些睡眠，潜意识善意地掩盖、缓和和扭曲它们的意义，于是我们的梦就变成了需要破译的象征作品。,"In order that we should get some sleep, the unconscious charitably conceals, softens and distorts its meanings, so that our dreams become symbolic texts which need to be deciphered."
9272,所有语言都存在短语结构规则，规定允许哪些d-结构。,All languages have phrase structure rules that specify the allowable d-structures.
9272,所有语言的短语都由中心语和补足语组成，句子都以Aux(或T)为中心语，Aux(或T)指的是有关时态、一致关系和情态有关的信息。,"In all languages, phrases consist of heads and complements, and sentences are headed by Aux (or T), which is specified for information such as tense, agreement, and modality."
9272,然而，在不同语言的短语和句子内，词序可能不同。,"However, languages may have different word orders within the phrases and sentences."
9273,话说回来，对于某些想要获得一份特定工作或就任一个尊荣职位的人来说，不可否认，标准方言（见第十章的定义）可能是一种更好的方言。,"Having said all this, it is undeniable that the standard dialect (defined in chapter 10) may indeed be a better dialect for someone wishing to obtain a particular job or achieve a position of social prestige."
9273,在一个“以言取人”（linguistic profiling) 、歧视少数族群方言使用者的社会中，对于这些使用者来说，与其坐等社会变化，也许还不如先学会优势方言更有必要。,"In a society where “linguistic profiling” is used to discriminate against speakers of a minority dialect, it may behoove those speakers to learn the prestige dialect rather than wait for social change."
9273,但是从语言学角度而言，优势方言和标准方言的语法并不高人一等。,"But linguistically, prestige and standard dialects do not have superior grammars."
9274,遗传学家认为这基因是显性的，但是不在X染色体上，因为男性和女性得到的几率是一样多。而且在这些个案中，他们的配偶(不论是先生还是太太)都是正常的，但是生下的小孩都有这毛病。,"The gene is thought to be autosomal (not on the X chromosome) and dominant because the syndrome struck males and females with equal frequency, and in all cases the spouse of an impaired parent, whether husband or wife, was normal."
9274,假如这个基因是隐性的，那么必须要父母双方都有这个毛病，小孩子才会遗传到这个毛病。,"If the gene were recessive and autosomal, it would be necessary to have two impaired parents to inherit the syndrome."
9274,假如它是隐性而且只在X染色体上的话，则只有儿于才会遗传到，女儿只是携带者而已。,"If it were recessive and on the X chromosome, only males would have it; females would be carriers."
9275,本世纪关于语言本能最著名的理论是由麻省理工学院的乔姆斯基所提出的，他是第一个揭开语言系统的精密性，也是奠定近代语言学的革命与促使认知科学诞生的最有力人物。,"In this century, the most famous argument that language is like an instinct comes from Noam Chomsky, the linguist who first unmasked the intricacy of the system and perhaps the person most responsible for the modern revolution in language and cognitive science."
9275,在20世纪50年代，行为主义支配了现代社会科学，当时所盛行的是华生和史金纳的理论。,"In the 1950s the social sciences were dominated by behaviorism, the school of thought popularized by John Watson and B. F. Skinner."
9275,他们认为有关心智的活动，例如 “知道”和“思考”是“不科学的”，而心智和天赋则是脏话。,"Mental terms like ''know"", and ''think'' were branded as unscientific; ''mind"" and ''innate"" were dirty words."
9276,1960年代，希利斯·米勒（J.Hillis Miller）深受日内瓦学派现象学批评的影响（见第3章有关部分）。,"During the 1960s, J. Hillis Miller was deeply influenced by the Geneva School’s ‘phenomenological’ criticism (see Chapter 3, p. 49)."
9276,从1970年代开始，他的著述转而集中对小说做解构批评（尤其是《小说与重复：七部英文小说》，1982）。,"His work since 1970 has centred on the deconstruction of fiction (especially in Fiction and Repetition: Seven English Novels, 1982)."
9276,这个阶段开始的标志是1970年他采用雅可布森关于隐喻与换喻的理论（见第4章有关文字）讨论狄更斯的一篇精彩论文。,"This phase was inaugurated with a fine paper on Dickens given in 1970, in which he takes up Jakobson’s theory of metaphor and metonymy (see Chapter 4, pp. 72–3)."
9277,日语有丰富的屈折变化，动词可以有三十多种不同的形式，仅仅使用词语文字并不合适。,"A word-writing system alone was not suitable for Japanese, which is a highly inflected language in which verbs may occur in thirty or more different forms."
9277,以经过修改的汉字为基础，学者为日语设计了音节语符，用以表示屈折变化词尾和其他的一些语法语素。,"Scholars devised syllabic characters, based on modified Chinese characters, to represent the inflectional endings and other grammatical morphemes."
9277,因此在日语的书写中，日语汉字通常用于表示词根，平假名则用作屈折变化的标记。,"Thus, in Japanese writing, kanji is commonly used for the verb roots, and hiragana symbols for the inflectional markings."
9278,"另一方面，在 bean，mean, comb和sing这些词的元音中，鼻音这一特征的值是可以预知的，因为它只出现在鼻辅音前。","On the other hand, the nasality feature value of the vowels in bean, mean, comb, and sing is predictable because they occur before nasal consonants."
9278,当某一类音的某个特征值可以通过规则预知的时候，这个特征就是非区别性的，或是冗余的，或者叫作这一类音的一个可预测特征（这三个术语是等价的）。,"When a feature value is predictable by rule for a certain class of sounds, the feature is a nondistinctive or redundant or predictable feature for that class.(The three terms are equivalent.)"
9278,因此，鼻音是英语元音的一个冗余特征，但却是英语辅音的一个非冗余 （区别性或是音位性的）特征 。,"Thus nasality is a redundant feature in English vowels, but a nonredundant (distinctive or phonemic) feature for English consonants."
9279,第一章仍然是对语言一般性研究的简要介绍。,Chapter 1 continues to be a concise introduction to the general study of language.
9279,现在本章除了以更多篇幅讨论手语和动物“语言”之外，还新增了“语言和思维”一节，讨论萨丕尔——沃尔夫假说。事实证明，这些内容学生都很感兴趣，会成为他们主动作进一步探索的动力。,"It now contains many “hooks” for engaging students in language study, including “Language and Thought,” which takes up the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis; discussions of signed languages; a consideration of animal “languages”; and a treatment of language origins."
9280,前面提到，塞音是非通音。,Stops and affricates belong to the class of noncontinuants.
9280,发非通音时空气在中完全阻断。,There is a total obstruction of the airstream in the oral cavity.
9280,还包括鼻塞音（虽然空气从鼻子里无间断地流出）和塞擦音。,Nasal stops are included although air does flow continuously out the nose.
9280,所有其他辅音，还有全部元音都是通音，发音时气流无间断地流出嘴巴。,"All other consonants, and all vowels, are continuants, in which the stream of air flows continuously out of the mouth."
9281,"不必对此深究，我们也能清楚地看到，虽然删节原理具有不少可取之处，并且可能以某种方式涉及到解决这一整套问题的正确方案，但是,仍然有许多证据需要解释。","Without pursuing the matter any further, we can see that although the erasure principle has much to recommend and is probably somehow involved in the correct solution to this network of problems, there is much evidence still to be accounted for."
9281,如在以上所提及的另外一些情况中，存在着许多与决定转换是否可行的条件有关的问题。这些问题仍然难以得到任何近似确切的解答，虽然人们能提出一些有意思的和有启发性的设想，这些设想也构成了对上述问题的总体解答的一部分。,"As in the other cases mentioned, there are a variety of problems relating to the conditions that determine applicability of transformations, problems that still resist any near-definitive solution, though some interesting and illuminating proposals can be made that seem to go part of the way toward a general solution."
9282,然而颇具吊诡色彩的是，现代主义对传统现实主义的拒斥反倒把社会主义现实主义推到资产阶级美学的主要监护人的位置上。,The modernist rejection of traditional realism paradoxically left Socialist Realism as the leading custodian of bourgeois aesthetics.
9282,在汤姆·斯托帕（Tom Stoppard）的剧作《拙劣模仿》（1975)中，达达主义诗人查拉抱怨说，“革命真是奇怪得恨，政治上你越是左倾，他们就越愿意他们的艺术更多资产阶级色彩。”,"In Tom Stoppard’s play Travesties (1975), the Dadaist poet Tzara is made to complain that ‘the odd thing about revolution is that the further left you go politically, the more bourgeois they like their art’."
9283,深层结构通过一定的心理操作—用现代的术语说就是语法转换—与表层结构相连。,"The deep structure is related to the surface structure by certain mental operations–in modern terminology, by grammatical transformations."
9283,每一种语言都可被当做是一种关于声音和意义的特殊关系。,Each language can be regarded as a particular relation between sound and meaning.
9283,这样，从波尔•罗瓦雅尔的理论中可以得出这样合乎逻辑的结论：一种语言的语法必定包含一个规则系统。该规则系统描述了深层结构和表层结构的特征以及二者之间的转换关系。如果要容纳语言运用的创造性的话，该系统还适用于无数对深层-表层结构。,"Following thePort-Royal theory to its logical conclusions, then, the grammar of alanguage must contain a system of rules that characterizes deep and surface structures and the transformational relation between them, and – if it is to accommodate the creative aspect of language use – that does so over an infinite domain of paired deep and surface structures."
9284,根据我们提出的研究方法，异议消失了，因为神话本身就提供了自己的上下文。,"With the method we propose to follow the objection disappears, since the myth itself provides its own context."
9284,因此，人们不再根据每一个姓名的最终意思去寻找意义，而是根据所有姓名的共同特征去寻找意义。因此，所有假设的意义（很可能始终保持假设）都指的是笔直地走路和笔直地站着的困难。,"The signiﬁcance is no longer to be sought in the eventual meaning of each name, but in the fact that all the names have a common feature: All the hypothetical meanings (which may well remain hypothetical) refer to difﬁculties in walking straight and standing upright."
9285,读者读到这里可能会产生异议，结构主义诗学对于批评家的实践似乎并没有提供多少助益。结构主义理论常常采用童话、神话、侦探小说作为例证也许并不是没有意义的。,"At this point, the reader may well object that structuralist poetics seems to have little to offer the practising critic, and it is perhaps significant that fairy stories, myths and detective stories often feature as examples in structuralist writings."
9285,这类研究旨在界定文学结构的一般原则，而不是为个别文本提供解释。,Such studies aim to define the general principles of literary structure and not to provide interpretations of individual texts.
9286,时装具有特别复杂的符号意义，可以同时具有社会、功能、色情及审美功能。,"Fashions are especially complex signs and may possess social, political, erotic and aesthetic functions."
9286,文学作品同样具有多种功能。,The same variability of function can be seen in literary products.
9286,一篇政治演讲稿、一部传记、一封书信和一件宣传品在不同社会和时代可能有审美功能，也可能没有审美功能。,"A political speech, a biography, a letter and a piece of propaganda may or may not possess aesthetic value in different societies and periods."
9286,“艺术”范畴的周边界限总是在变化着，而且总是与某种社会结构存在动态关联。,"The circumference of the sphere of ‘art’ is always changing, and always dynamically related to the structure of society."
9287,"考验心灵的成功与否，就看它是否能够面对眼前的一切,而且作出反应时并不假借无数的逃脱借口，而心灵通常躲避了经验的充分发挥。",The test of its success is whether it can face what is before it and respond to it without any of the innumerable subterfuges by which it ordinarily dodges the full development of experience.
9287,压制和升华同样是我们力求回避那些可能困惑我们的问题的手段。,Suppressions and sublimations alike are devices by which we endeavour to avoid issues which might bewilder us.
9287,悲剧的实质则在于迫使我们体验到没有这些手段时的生活片刻。,The essence of tragedy is that it forces us to live for a moment without them.
9287,当我们有了成功的体验，我们就会发现一般不存在困难。困难过去来自于压制和升华。,"When we succeed we find, as usual, that there is no difficulty; the difficulty came from the suppressions and sublimations."
9288,说出来的一个语句，首先是说话人脑/心中的一条信息。,A spoken utterance starts as a message in the speaker's brain/mind.
9288,该信息转换成语言形式并被解读为一条说话指令， 以声学信号的形式出现。,"It is put into linguistic form and interpreted as articulation commands, emerging as an acoustic signal."
9288,信号经听话人耳朵的处理后，发送至他的脑/心，在那里得到解读。,"The signal is processed by the listener’s ear and sent to the brain/mind, where it is interpreted."
9289,正如我们前面见到的那样，言语链源自说话人，经过一系列复杂的神经-肌肉处理，然后产生代表思想、想法或信息的声学信号。该声学信号传递到听话人那里，他必须对信号解码才能获得与原意相近的信息。,"As we saw, the speech chain starts with a speaker who, through some complicated set of neuromuscular processes, produces an acoustic signal that represents a thought, idea, or message to be conveyed to a listener, who must then decode the signal to arrive at a similar message."
9289,目的在于了解说话人如何处理言语的实验，设计起来要难于目的在于了解听话人如何处理言语的实验。,It is more difficult to devise experiments that provide information about how the speaker proceeds than to do so for the listener's side of the process.
9290,客观上有声音产生，主观上则没有声音。,"Objectively, a sound is produced; subjectively, there is no sound."
9290,事实上，有一些声音我们听不见，是因为我们的耳朵并不是对所有频率都敏感。,"In fact, there are sounds we cannot hear because our ears are not sensitive to the full range of frequencies."
9290,声学语音学只研究语音，所有语音都是正常人耳能听见的声音。,"Acoustic phonetics is concerned only with speech sounds, all of which can be heard by the normal human ear."
9291,“可悲者”应该和弗洛伊德所谓“被压抑者”相区别。,The abject is to be distinguished from the Freudian notion of the repressed.
9291,克里斯蒂娃运用这个概念讨论了陀斯妥耶夫斯基、普鲁斯特、乔伊斯、博尔赫斯和阿尔托（Artaud)等人的作品，特别用它作为理解法国小说家路易·费迪南·赛利纳 (Louis Ferdinand Celine）作品中反犹信仰的一种方式。,"Kristeva employs the concept to discuss literary works by Dostoevsky, Proust, Joyce, Borges and Artaud, and,principally, as a way of understanding the anti-Semitic beliefs of the French novelist, Louis Ferdinand Céline."
9291,她把文学与圣经看作表示可悲者的独特的能指，能够揭示……放散、抽空这种可悲性（《恐怖的权力》）。,"Literature and the Bible she views as‘privileged signiﬁers’ of the abject, as enacting ‘an unveiling ...a discharge and hollowing out of abjection’ (1982)."
9292,最终，这种图画文字也开始同时代表概念和表示这一概念的词。,"Eventually, these pictograms came to represent both the concept and the word for the concept."
9292,一旦发展到这一步，象形文字就演变为真正的表语文字系统。,"Once this happened, hieroglyphics became a bona fide logographic writing system."
9292,通过画谜原理，埃及象形文字也演变成一种音节文字。,"Through the rebus principle, hieroglyphics also became a syllabic writing system."
9293,如果把诗歌作为一种行为，关键的问题一直是写作诗歌的作者的行为与发言者，或者是在那里朗诵的“声音”的行为之间的关系。,"For the poem as act, a key question has been the relation between the act of the author who writes the poem and that of the speaker or ‘voice’ that speaks there."
9293,这是一个错综的问题。,This is a complicated matter.
9293,作者不是去说出一首诗；写作一首诗就是说作者想像他/她自己，或者另外一个声音去朗诵这首诗。,"The author does not speak the poem; to write it, the author imagines him or herself or another voice speaking it."
9294,"维克多·什 克洛夫斯基(Viktor Shklovsky)、尤里·蒂尼亚诺夫(Yury Tynyanov)和鲍里斯·艾亨鲍姆(Boris Eikhenbaum)是诗歌研究 会的杰出代表。形式主义最初的激发力来自未来主义者。第一次世界大战前,未来主义者在艺术领域的努力主要是攻击 “ 颓废的 ”中产阶级文化, 特别是反对诗歌和视觉艺术中痛苦地进行灵魂剖析的象征主义运动,他们嘲弄诗人们故弄玄虚的做作,譬如,勃留索夫就坚持说诗人是 “神秘精神的卫士”。","Viktor Shklovsky, Yury Tynyanov and Boris Eikhenbaum were prominent in Opojaz.The initial impetus was provided by the Futurists, whose artistic efforts before the First World War were directed against ‘decadent’ bourgeois culture and especially against the anguished soul-searching of the Symbolist movement in poetry and the visual arts.They derided the mystical posturing of poets such as Briusov who insisted that the poet was ‘the guardian of the mystery’."
9295,通过说“我警告你在衣橱里有一个牧羊犬”，你不仅说了些什么，还警告了某人。,"By saying I warn you that there is a sheepdog in the closet, you not only say something, you warn someone."
9295,如bet(打赌)、 promise (承诺)、warn (警告)等动词是施行动词。,"Verbs like bet, promise, warn, and so on are performative verbs."
9295,在句子(第一人称、现在时)中使用这类动词，会在陈述之外增加一些额外的东西。,"Using them in a sentence (in the first person, present tense) adds something extra over and above the statement."
9296,判断一个句子中是否含有施行动词的一个非正式测试，是在句子前面加上I hereby...(我特此)。,An informal test to see whether a sentence contains a performative verb is to begin it with the words I hereby.
9296,这样开头只有施行句听起来是正确的。,. . . Only performative sentences sound right when begun this way.
9296,对比一下I hereby apologize to you (我特此向你道歉)和有些奇怪的I hereby know you (我特此认识你)。,Compare I hereby apologize to you with the somewhat strange I hereby know you.
9296,一般认为前一句是一个道歉的行为。,The first is generally taken as an act of apologizing.
9296,在以上所有给出的例子中，插入hereby(特此)都是可以接受的。,"In all of the examples given, insertion of hereby would be acceptable."
9297,面对莎士比亚十四行诗的开头“我心爱的姑娘的眼睛绝不像那太阳”，我们并不去问此话是真是假，而是 问它做了什么，它和这首诗里其他的句子是怎样协调的，以及它与其他行之间的配合是否愉快（给人以快感）。,"Confronted with the opening of Shakespeare’s sonnet ‘My mistress’ eyes are nothing like the sun’, we ask not whether this utterance is true or false, but what it does, how it fits in with the rest of the poem, and whether it works happily (felicitously) with the other lines."
9297,可以说这便是精妙语句的一种概念。,That might be one conception of felicity.
9297,但述行语的模式还把我们的注意吸引到能让一句话成为-个承诺，或者成为一句诗的传统程式——比如十四行诗的传统程式。,"But the model of the performative also directs our attention to the conventions that enable an utterance to be a promise or a poem – the conventions of the sonnet, say."
9297,因此文学言语的得体就可能包括它与一种体裁的传统程式的关系。,The felicitousness of a literary utterance might thus involve its relation to the conventions of a genre.
9298,我已谈到，对于海德格尔来说，理解完全是历史性的，但这一说法现在需要稍加限定。,"I have said that understanding for Heidegger is radically historical, but this now needs to be qualified somewhat."
9298,海德格尔的大作的标题是《存在与时间》而非《存在与历史》；在这两个概念之间存在着重要的区别。,The title of his major work is Being and Time rather than Being and History; and there is a significant difference between the two concepts.
9298,时间在某种意义上是一个比历史更为抽象的概念：它使人联想到的是岁月的流逝或者我体验我个人生命形态的可能方式，而不是民族的斗争，人口的养育杀戮，或国家的建立推翻。,"'Time' is in one sense a more abstract notion than history: it suggests the passing of the seasons, or the way I might experience the shape of my personal life, rather than the struggles of nations, the nurturing and slaughtering of populations or the making and toppling of states."
9299,如果生命这个字眼似乎过于宽泛而朦胧，那么探究它的这种批评技术似乎就相应地过于狭窄。,"If Life seemed altogether too broad and nebulous a term, the critical techniques for detecting it seemed correspondingly too narrow."
9299,由于实用批评本身大有成为一种过分实用的专业的危险，从而与一个其所关心者恰是立明的命运的运动不甚相称，所以利维斯主义者们需要用一种“形而上学”来对它进行基础加固，并在芳伦斯的作品中找到了现成的一个。,"Since practical criticism in itself threatened to become too pragmatic a pursuit for a movement con- cerned with nothing less than the fate of civilization, the Leavisites needed to underpin it with a 'metaphysic', and found one ready to hand in the work of D. H. Lawrence."
9299,既然生命不是理论体系而是恃殊直觉的问题，你就始终能够站在生命一边，以便攻击他人的体系；但是，既然生命又是象你想象的那么绝对的一种价值，你就同样可以用它来痛打那些鼠目寸光的功利主义者和经验主义者。,"Since Life was not a theoretical system but a matter of particular intuitions, you could always take your stand on these in order to attack other people's systems; but since Life was also as absolute a value as you could imagine, you could equally use it to lambaste those utilitarians and empiricists who could see no further than their noses."
9300,最后，极端的实证主义并不见得是一个比较进步、比较人道的教条。,"Finally, radical empiricism is not necessarily a progressive, humanitarian doctrine."
9300,人的心智若像一块白板，这是独裁者的梦想。,A blank slate is a dictator's dream.
9300,有一些心理学课本中有提到一些“事实”说：斯巴达和日本武士的母亲在听说他们的儿子战死沙场时会微笑。,"Some psychology textbooks mention the ""fact"" that Spartan and samurai mothers smiled upon hearing that their sons fell in battle."
9301,“做事”的动词称为施行动词。,Verbs that “do things” are called performative verbs.
9301,说话者说话时的意图称为示意语力。,The speaker’s intent in making an utterance is known as illocutionary force.
9301,就施行动词而言，示意语力是明确提及的，在其他情况下则必须根据语境来确定。,"In the case of performative verbs, the illocutionary force is mentioned overtly.In other cases it must be determined from context."
9302,像《牛津英语词典》或者《韦伯斯特大学词典》这样的词典里写满了词和它们的意义。,Dictionaries such as the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) or Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary are filled with words and their meanings.
9302,词典使用其他的词来给出词的意义，而不是通过某种更基本的词汇。,"Dictionaries give the meaning of words using other words rather than in terms of some more basic units of meaning, whatever they might be."
9302,在这个意义上来说，词典提供的只是释义句，而不是意义。,In this sense a dictionary really provides paraphrases rather than meanings.
9302,词典依赖我们关于语言的知识才能让我们理解定义。,It relies on our knowledge of the language to understand the definitions.
9303,如果麦赫勒和拜佛尔的初步结果是正确的，那么，由此就可得出“最后阶段”在智慧发展的最初时期就已完成，在这一阶段里，守恒概念才得到完全的理解。,"If the preliminary results of Mehler and Bever are correct, then it would follow that the“final stage,”in which conservation is properly understood, was already realized at a very early period of development."
9303,随后，儿童发展出一种启发式技术，这种技术基本上是可行的，只是在守恒实验的条件下才遭到了失败。,"Later, the child develops a heuristic technique that is largely adequate but that fails under the conditions of the conservation experiment."
9303,再往后，他对此技术进行调整并再次在守恒实验中作出正确的判断。,"Still later, he adjusts this technique successfully and once again makes the correct judgments in the conservation experiment."
9304,不过读者中的绝大多数人都不太苛求。,But the majority of readers are less exigent.
9304,只要印刷字体清晰易读，使得阅读时习惯的目光移动可以自如地进行，同样由迥然相异的感觉形成的完整反应就会产生。,"Provided that the print is clear and legible, and allows the habitual eye-movements of reading to be easily performed, the full response arises equally well from widely differing sensations."
9304,这种情况适合某些人，在目前排版组织节省的状况下，比起遇到较为考究的排版组织，他们就有着确定无疑的优势。,"Those for whom this is true have, in the present state of economic organization, a decided advantage over the more fastidious."
9304,这并不证明好的印刷上的考虑可以置于不顾，中国艺术中书法居于首位就表明相反的情况。,This does not show that good printing is a negligible consideration; and the primary place of calligraphy in the Chinese arts is an indication to the contrary.
9304,它只是证明印刷属于艺术的另一个分支。,It shows merely that printing belongs to another branch of the arts.
9305,约翰逊曾这样赞美莎士比亚：有力的笔能驾驭着感受的真理，遏止不住的热情激荡在心里。这并不是溢美之词。约翰逊对《哈姆雷特》以及《李尔王》和《奥赛罗》结尾的几个场景的强烈反应就是证明。,"Johnson’s praise of Shakespeare-His powerful strokes presiding Truth impressed And unresisted passion stormed the breast－is not empty declamation, as the intensity of Johnson’s response to Hamlet, and to the closing scenes of Lear and Othello, demonstrates."
9305,至少在抒情诗中，成功地激发读者的情感，被认为是以诗人先此而有的情感状态为前提的。,"And at least in the lyric forms, the successful evocation of feeling from the reader was held to entail a prior state of feeling in the poet."
9306,问题是，在斯皮瓦克的使用中，这个被殖民的非精英层是不能说话的。,"The problem is that this colonized non-elite, in Spivak’s usage, cannot speak."
9306,这就是说，被压迫者、被消音者从定义上讲就不能说话，不能取得自我合法性，除非不再成为新殖民主义体制下那个被命名的主体。,"That is to say, the oppressed and silenced cannot, by definition, speak or achieve self-legitimation without ceasing to be that named subject under neo-colonialism."
9306,但是，假若被压迫的属下不能被西方知识分子讲说——因为这不会改变这样一个重要事实，即他们的地位仍旧如故——自己也不能为自己说话，那么，显而易见，就不会有非殖民主义或反殖民主义话语了。,"But if the oppressed subalterns cannot be spoken for by Western intellectuals – because this would not alter the most important fact of their position – nor speak for themselves, there can apparently be no non- or anti-colonial discourse."
9307,在世界上的许多地方，特别是在非洲和亚洲，双语现象（甚至多语现象）是常态。,"In many parts of the world, especially in Africa and Asia, bilingualism (even multilingualism) is the norm."
9307,相反，许多欧洲国家（尽管决非所有的）认为自己是单语社会，即使有许多说多种语言的人生活在那儿。,"In contrast, many Western countries (though by no means all of them) view themselves as monolingual, even though they may be home to speakers of many languages."
9307,在美国和许多欧洲国家，双语现象常常被视为与移民有关的过渡现象。,"In the United States and many European countries, bilingualism is often viewed as a transitory phenomenon associated with immigration."
9308,与大多数双语儿童一样，使用LSQ和法语的双语儿童也会生成含有两种语言词的混合语句。,"Like most bilingual children, the LSQ-French bilinguals produced mixed utterances that had words from both languages."
9308,特别有意思的是，这些儿童会发生同时的语言混用。,What is especially interesting is that these children showed simultaneous language mixing.
9308,他们会同时在打出一个LSQ符号的同时说出一个法语词。只有在说一种语言的同时使用一种手语，这种现象才可能出现。,"They would produce an LSQ sign and a French word at the same time, something that is only possible if one language is spoken and the other signed."
9308,这一发现对于双语语言习得来说具有普遍意义。,"However, this finding has implications for bilingual language acquisition in general."
9308,它表明双语儿童的语言混用并不是因混乱而造成的，而是两种语言的语法同时作用的结果。,"It shows that the language mixing of bilingual children is not caused by confusion, but is rather the result of two grammars operating simultaneously."
9309,调音部位、方式相同的语音有可能长短不同。,Speech sounds that are identical in their place or manner features may differ in length (duration).
9309,英语中紧元音一般比松元音长，不过只是稍长一点，大约几十毫秒。,"Tense vowels are slightly longer than lax vowels, but only by a few milliseconds."
9309,但在有些语言中长元音可能长出一倍，这能用来区别词义。,"However, in some languages when a vowel is prolonged to around twice its normal length, it can make a difference between words."
9309,"例如日语中biru[biru]是“建筑”，如果是长i，biiru[bi:ru],那就是“啤酒”了。（形如冒号的：是IPA表示音段长或者音程加倍的符号。）","In Japanese the word biru [biru] with a regular i means “building”, but with the i doubled in length as in biiru, spelled phonetically as [biːru], the meaning is “beer” (The colon-like ː is the IPA symbol for segment length or doubling.) In Japanese vowel length can make the difference between two words."
9310,而在发spit（吐痰）的p时，双唇刚分开，声带就开始振动了。,"When we pronounce the p in spit, however, the vocal cords start vibrating as soon as the lips open."
9310,这种音叫作不送气。,That p is unaspirated.
9310,把手掌放在嘴巴前5厘米的地方，然后说pit，你会感觉到一股气流，而说spit的时候就没有气流。,"Hold your palm about two inches in front of your lips and say pit.You will feel a puff of air, which you will not feel when you say spit."
9310,Tick（嘀嗒）中的t和kin（亲戚）中的k也是送气清塞音，而stick（手杖）中的t和skin（皮）中的k是不送气音。,"The t in tick and the k in kin are also aspirated voiceless stops, while the t in stick and the k in skin are unaspirated."
9311,"当然,很明显，任何一个有理智的人都会偏好严格的分析和细致的实验。但是，在相当时程度上，我觉得，“行为科学”只不过是对自然科学表面特征的模仿；它的许多科学的特征是通过限制主要研究论题，集中于次要问题而获得的。","Obviously any rational person will favor rigorous analysis and careful experiment; but to a considerable degree, I feel, the “behavioral sciences” are merely mimicking the surface features of the natural sciences; much of their scientific character has been achieved by a restriction of subject matter and a concentration on rather peripheral issues."
9311,这种对论题的缩小如果具有真正的学术意义，那倒也是有理由的。但是，对我们讨论的问题来说，我看不出论题的缩小能带来什么深刻的和有重大意义的结果。,"Such narrowing of focus can be justified if it leads to achievements of real intellectual significance, but in this case, I think it would be very difficult to show that the narrowing of scope has led to deep and significant results."
9312,然而，这个单子永远不会完整。,"However, the list can never be complete."
9312,新词、新词形式、专有名词、缩写和缩略语不断地添加入语言中，无法预期。,"New words, new word forms, proper names, abbreviations, and acronyms are constantly being added to the language and cannot be anticipated."
9312,这个由文字到言语的系统需要给词典未收录的词条制定对话规则，而这些必须是共振峰合成器或连结合成器基于比要说的词更小的单位的产出物。,"The text-to-speech system requires conversion rules for items not in its dictionary, and these must be output by a formant synthesizer or a concatenative synthesizer based on units smaller than the word if they are to be spoken."
9313,如果一个词的意义不同于一个词典条目，那它是什么？,"If the meaning of a word is not like a dictionary entry, what is it?"
9313,这个问题哲学家和语言学家已经争论了几个世纪。,This question has been debated by philosophers and linguists for centuries.
9313,一种理论认为一个词的意义是它的所指，也就是它所指的事物。,"One proposal is that the meaning of a word or expression is its reference, its association with the object it refers to."
9313,这个现实世界的对象就称为所指。,This real world object is called the referent.
9314,苔莎拉意味着一种“片断”，暗示前辈诗人的诗作都是片断的材料，要求后辈诗人最终加工完成。,"Tessera is ‘fragment’: a poet treats the materials of a precursor poem as if they were in pieces, and required the finishing touch of the successor."
9314,克利纳门（修正率）具有“反讽”的修辞形式（指语言而非思想），叫做“反其道构形”。,"Clinamen (revisionary ratio) has the rhetorical form of ‘irony’ (the figure of speech, not of thought), and is the psychic defence called ‘reaction-formation’."
9314,反讽表示说此意彼（不同或相反）。,Irony says one thing and means something different (sometimes the opposite).
9314,其他的修正率与此类似，都是以比喻或心理防范表示的（苔莎拉用提喻，即反对自身，等等）。,"The other ratios are similarly expressed as both trope and psychic defence (tessera = synecdoche = ‘turning against the Self’, and so on)."
9315,约翰孙的一些同时代人颠倒了这一侧重点，至少是注重了对有形场面的描述，同时更为强调特殊性在创作诗歌佳作中的功用。,"Some of Johnson's contemporaries reversed this balance, with respect at least to descriptions of the visible scene, and gave greater emphasis to the role of particularity in achieving poetic excellence."
9315,因此，约瑟夫• 沃顿说，“语言的作用、力量和优越性当然在于创造清晰的、完整的和偶然的意象。”并告诫说:“我认为，即便在著名作家身上，我也可以找出他们在描绘自然时偏离真实、生动和细腻的毛病，以及不厌其烦地絮叨普遍性的毛病。”,"Thus Joseph Warton said that ‘the use, the force, and the excellence of language, certainly consists in raising, clear, complete, and circumstan Wtinniages’；and warned that ‘I think I can perceive many symptoms, even among writers of eminence， of departing from these true, and lively and minute, representations of Nature, and of dwelling in generalities'."
9316,强力诗人们分别或连续采用六种心理防范形式来对付那种“影响的焦虑”（anxiety of influence）。,Strong poets cope with the ‘anxiety of influence’ by adopting separately or successively six psychic defences.
9316,这些形式以比喻的形式出现在他们的诗歌中，使他们可以从父辈的诗歌中“转脱”出来。,These appear in their poetry as tropes which allow a poet to ‘swerve’ from a father’s poems.
9316,这六种比喻是：反讽、提喻、换喻、夸张/反语、隐喻、再换喻（ metalepsis）。,"The six tropes are irony, synecdoche, metonymy, hyperbole/litotes, metaphor and metalepsis."
9317,"弗莱所著的《批评的剖析》是一本研究抒情诗和其他文学体裁的极有价值的指导手册。它称抒情诗的基本构成是咿呀之语和信手拈来的东西,它们的根基是魅力和难以理解。","Frye, whose Anatomy of Criticism is an invaluable compendium of thinking about lyric and other genres, calls the basic constituents of lyric babble and doodle, whose roots are charm and riddle."
9317,诗歌咿呀道来，突出的是语言的非语义特点—声音、韵律、字母的重复一以此创造魅力或重叠：这条棕色的小溪像骏马的鬃毛，—路欢叫，奔腾而下……,"Poems babble, foregrounding non-semantic features of language-sound, rhythm, repetition of letters-to produce charm or incantation: This darksome burn, horseback brown, His rollrock highroad roaring down .. ."
9318,"为了使批评家胜任愉快，维护公认的标准而抵制托尔斯泰式的攻击缩小这些标准与通俗趣味的差距，保护文学艺术而反对清教徒及反常变态者赤裸裸的道镲说教，必须提出一种总体性的价值理论，它将不会停留在“这是好的，那是坏的""一类说法上。","To habilitate the critic, to defend accepted standards against Tolstoyan attacks, to narrow the interval between these standards and popular taste, to protect the arts against the crude moralities of Puritans and perverts, a general theory of value, which will not leave the statement ‘This is good, that bad,’ either vague or arbitrary, must be provided.There is no alternative open."
9318,这类说法不是含糊便是武断，可以说別无选择，价值理论并非是文不对脱离了人们想象中的深入文学艺术本质的探索，因为如果说一种有根有据的价值理论是批评的必要条件那么同样确凿无疑，理 解文学艺术中发生的一切乃是价值理论所需要的，什么是好的？,"Nor is it such an excursus from the inquiry into the nature of the arts as may be supposed.For if a well-grounded theory of value is a necessity for criticism, it is no less true that an understanding of what happens in the arts is needed for the theory."
9318,” 和“什么是文学艺术这两个问题是互为照明的。,The two problems ‘What is good?’ and ‘What are the arts?’ reflect light upon one another.
9318,实际上二者缺少任何一个都无法给予充分的解答。,Neither in fact can be fully answered without the other.
9318,现在我们可以进而理顺第一个问题。,To the unravelling of the first we may now proceed.
9319,从历史上说，研究通俗文化的思想和使一个人的成果成为一种政治介入是紧密相联的。,"Historically, the ideas of studying popular culture and of making one’s work a political intervention are closely linked."
9319,在六七十年代的英国，研究工人阶级的文化就有一种政治内涵。,In Britain in the 1960s and 1970s studying working-class culture had a political charge.
9319,英国似乎是一个民族文化特征与高雅文化的丰碑连在一起的国家——只要想想莎士比亚和英国文学悠久的传统就知道了——所以研究通俗文化本身就是一种反抗的行为。而在美国就完全不是如此。那是一个常常用反对高雅文化来解释其民族特点的国家。,"In Britain, where national cultural identity seemed linked to monuments of high culture – Shakespeare and the tradition of English literature, for example – the very fact of studying popular culture was an act of resistance, in a way that it isn’t in the United States, where national identity has often been defined against high culture."
9320,在中世纪，一种商用语言逐步在地中海诸港口使用开来，该语言主要以演变成为现代意大利语和普罗旺斯语的那种语言为基础。,"In medieval times, a trade language based largely on the languages that became modern Italian and Provençal came into use in the Mediterranean ports."
9320,人们称这种语言为通用语，即“佛兰卡语”。,"That language was called Lingua Franca, “Frankish language.”"
9320,这个术语后来被泛化了，用来指称其他具有相似用途的语言，因此，任何语言都可能成为一种通用语。,"The term lingua franca was generalized to other languages similarly used.Thus, any language can be a lingua franca."
9321,从形式表达中很容易可以看出该规则是一条同化规则，因为在[+鼻]音段前发生了[+鼻]变化。,It is easy to see in the formal statement of the rule that this is an assimilation rule because the change to [+nasal] occurs before [+nasal] segments.
9321,语言中的同化规则反映协同发音——语音既可预见（后面的音影响前面的）也可接续（或者说“保留”，即前面的音影响后面的）调音过程来传播语音特征。,Assimilation rules in languages reflect coarticulation—the spreading of phonetic features either in the anticipation or in the perseveration (the “hanging on”) of articulatory processes.
9321,结果使得这个词听起来更流畅一些。,The auditory effect is that words sound smoother.
9322,我们在阿肯语中可以看到一种不同的同化规则。鼻音否定语素在/p/前面表达为/m/，在/t/前面表达为/n/，在/k/前面表达为/ ŋ /（这叫作同位鼻音规则）。,"We saw a different kind of assimilation rule in Akan, where we observed that the nasal negative morpheme was expressed as [m] before /p/, [n] before /t/, and [ŋ] before /k/.(This is the homorganic nasal rule.)"
9322,在这个例子中，鼻音的调音部位—双唇，龈，软腭—被其后所接辅音的部位所同化。,"In this case the place of articulation—bilabial, alveolar, velar—of the nasal assimilates to the place of articulation of the following consonant."
9323,字位（即字母）与音位之间的不规则对应，常被用来作为“为什么约翰尼不会阅读？”的一个原因。,The irregularities between graphemes (letters) and phonemes have been cited as one reason “why Johnny can’t read.”
9323,同形异义词，如lead[lid]和lead[led]，对拼写改革运动起到了推波助澜的作用。,Homographs such as lead /lid/ and lead /lɛd/ have fueled the flames of spelling reform movements.
9323,相同发音的不同拼写、不发音的字母，以及“丢失的字母”，都被认为是英语需要一个新正字法系统的原因。,"Different spellings for the same sound, silent letters, and missing letters also are cited as reasons that English needs a new orthographic system."
9324,马克思主义理论认为主体是由阶级地位决定的：它或者从别人的劳动中获利，或者为别人的利润而劳动。,Marxist theory sees the subject as determined by class position: it either profits from others’ labour or labours for others’ profit.
9324,女权主义理论强调社会建构的性角色在把主体制造或他或她所起的作用。,Feminist theory stresses the impact of socially constructed gender roles on making the subject what he or she is.
9324,同性恋理论一直认为异性的主体是在压制同性恋行为的可能性中建构的。,Queer theory has argued that the heterosexual subject is constructed through the repression of the possibility of homosexuality.
9325,同音形词可以造成歧义。,Homonyms can create ambiguity.
9325,下面这个句子：I'll meet you by the bank.,The sentence: I’ll meet you by the bank.
9325,(我会在bank边上和你见面。）意义可能是“我会在银行边上和你见面”或者“我会在河岸边上和你见面”。,may mean “I’ll meet you by the financial institution” or “I’ll meet you by the riverside.”
9326,“突出”可以有多种办法，包括采用偏离语法或不合语法结构，但对雅各布森而言，最重要的手段是运用非常齐整的语言。,"Foregrounding may be accomplished in various ways, including the use of deviant or ungrammatical constructions, but for Jakobson the principal technique is the use of highly patterned language."
9326,他那用以识别诗学功能的语言学标准的著名定义，也由此而来：“诗学功能将同义原则从选择轴投射到组合轴上。”,"Whence his famous definition of the linguistic criterion by which the poetic function is to be identified: ‘The poetic function projects the principle of equivalence from the axis of selection into the axis of combination’ (‘Linguistics and Poetics’, p. 358)."
9327,苏美尔人首先发明了一套图画文字系统，用以记录商业交易。,The Sumerians first developed a pictographic writing system to keep track of commercial transactions.
9327,这个系统后来又扩大到其他各种用途，最终发展成高度定形（尖头笔写成的）的楔形文字。,It was later expanded for other uses and eventually evolved into the highly stylized (and stylus-ized) cuneiform writing.
9327,通过应用画谜原则，楔形文字概括发展为其他的文字系统。画谜原则指用一个词或音节的符号代表与其读音相同的另一个词或音节。,"Cuneiform was generalized to other writing systems by application of the rebus principle, which uses the symbol of one word or syllable to represent another word or syllable pronounced the same."
9328,无论在古代还是今天，图画文字在世界各地都有发现：非洲各部落、美洲土著（包括美国阿拉斯加和加拿大的因纽特人)、秘鲁的印加人、西伯利亚的尤卡吉尔人（Yukagirian)和大洋洲土著。,"Pictographic writing has been found throughout the world, ancient and modern: among Africans, Native Americans including the Inuits of Alaska and Canada, the Incas of Peru, the Yukagirians of Siberia, and the people of Oceania."
9328,今天，国际通用的道路标志仍使用图画文字，因为并非所有的旅行者都懂当地语言。,"Pictograms are used today in international road signs, where the native language of the region might not be understood by all travelers."
9328,这种符号人人都能看懂，因为它们不依赖于任何语言。,
9328,,Such symbols do not depend on words.
9329,这种思维的形式在“现代”科技化的思维中并没有很大变化，尽管现代思维往佳总是错误地倾向于仅仅在语言的书面形式下考虑语言这种我们自身经验构成的、“非反映的汇总”。,"It is a form which does not significantly vary in the case of the ‘modern’ technological mind however much that tends, misleadingly, to think of language, that formative, ‘unreflecting totalization’ of our experience, solely in its written mode."
9329,我们和“原始人”一样也有那种思维，它原来是一种具有很大威力的、从根本上说是“创造结构的”力量。,"That mind, which exists in us no less than in ‘primitive’ man, proves to be a fundamentally ‘structuring’ agency of considerable power."
9329,值得考虑的明显的事实是，它创造结构的能力的最主要的表现之一—图腾制度—并不只是“野蛮人”所从事的事情。,"And it is worth pondering the evident fact that one of the foremost manifestations of its structuring capacity, totemism, is not simply something in which ‘savages’ engage."
9330,使用外接缀的语言中，人们更为熟悉是德语。,An example of a more familiar circumfixing language is German.
9330,德语规则动词的过去分词，是通过在动词词根加上前缀ge-和后缀-t构成的。,The past participle of regular verbs is formed by adding the prefix ge- and the suffix -t to the verb root.
9330,给动词词根lieb(爱）加上这样的外接缀，就会生成geliebt(动词“爱”的过去分词，或者用作形容词，意为“心爱的”）。,"This circumfix added to the verb root lieb “love” produces geliebt, “loved” (or “beloved,” when used as an adjective)."
9331,据我所知，皮尔士在强调对那种限制可能的理论类别的规则的研究上，是独具匠心的。,"Peirce, to my knowledge, is original and unique in stressing the problem of studying the rules that limit the class of possible theories."
9331,当然，他的外展概念像洛伦兹的生物先验性概念一样，具有浓厚的康德气味，并且都得自于关乎形式、限度和原理的唯理主义的心理学。这些形式、限度和原理为人类思维提供了“主要支柱和联结关系”，构成了莱布尼兹所说的“我们并非总会意识到的无限知识”的基础。,"Of course, his concept of abduction, like Lorenz’s biological a priori, has a strongly Kantian flavor, and all derive from the rationalist psychology that concerned itself with the forms, the limits, and the principles that provide “the sinews and connections” for human thought, that underlie “that infinite amount of knowledge of which we are not always conscious,” of which Leibnitz spoke."
9332,我们之所以为人，就在于我们有身体，比较特别的是我们有神经系统。更为特别的，是它的比较高级或比较核心的相互协调的那 些部分，精神乃是一个冲动系统，这种观点不应称为唯物主义的。,"The view that we are our bodies, more especially our nervous systems, more especially still the higher or more central coordinating parts of it, and that the mind is a system of impulses should not be described as Materialism."
9332,人们同样不妨称之为唯心主义的在这一方面，两个术语都没有任何科学的、任何严格的象征意义或所指意义。,"It might equally well be called Idealism.Neither term in this connection has any scientific, any strictly symbolic meaning or reference."
9333,与德国的情况不同，英国的浪漫主义批评使用的是两个不同宇宙的类比一作诗与创造宇宙之间的相似性一意在阐明文学创作的过程而非其产品。,"In English, unlike German romantic criticism, the heterocosmic analogue —the parallel between writing poetry and creating the universe—was used to illuminate the process more chan the product of literary invention."
9333,直到十九世纪后期，英国批评家们仍在探索这一类比是否完全可能用以支撑这一概念，即现存的诗就是属于其自身的完全自给自足的世界。,It remained for English critics later in the century to explore the full possibilities of the parallel as a ground for the concept that the poem-in-being is its own and utterly self-sufficient world.
9333,关于这一传统做法，有一份文献道出了真谛，那就是A.C.布拉德利发表于1901年的牛津演讲《为诗而诗》。,"A. C, Bradley's Oxford lecture, Poetry for Poetry's Sake published in 1901, is a revealing document in this tradition."
9333,这个演讲一方面简要地总结了为艺术而艺术这一审美原则（事实上它已成了为艺术而生活的道德原则）中立足最稳的东西。,"On the one side, the lecture epitomizes what had been most tenable in the aesthetic doctrine of Art for Art's Sake (which, in its common form, had really been a moral doctrine of Life for Art's Sake)."
9333,另一方面，他在演讲中也表述了后来成为当今某些批评家的中心论点的东西，这些批评家（没有注意到其不一致性）引用了麦克利什的关于诗不表达真实而只是存在的富有诗意的表述，并把它视为真理。,"On the other side, ic formulates what has since become the central position of present-day critics who (without noticing the incongruity) cite as a truth MacLeish'S poetic statement that a poem does not state truth but simply exists."
9334,该假说比较温和的一个形式是语言相对论，认为不同的语言对不同的范畴编码，因此说不同语言的人对世界的思考有不同的方式。,"A weaker form of the hypothesis is linguistic relativism, which says that different languages encode different categories and that speakers of different languages therefore think about the world in different ways."
9334,比如，不同的语言在色谱上截取颜色的分界点不同。,"For example, languages break up the color spectrum at different points."
9334,在印第安纳瓦霍语里，蓝色和绿色是同一个词。,"In Navaho, blue and green are one word."
9334,俄语中的深蓝色和天蓝色用不同的词表示，而在英语里，我们需要用dark(深）和sky(天来区别其中的差异。,"Russian has different words for dark blue (siniy) and light blue (goluboy), while in English we need to use the additional words dark and light to express the difference."
9334,美国印第安祖尼语不区别黄色和橙色。,The American Indian language Zuni does not distinguish between the colors yellow and orange.
9334,语言在表达方位方面也不尽相同。,Languages also differ in how they express locations.
9335,最后，我们还重新选编了“选读书目”，使所列著作更简明，更新，更容易找到。,"Finally, the ‘Selected Reading’ sections have again been recast to make them more accessible and up-to-date."
9335,这里一个显著的改动是增加了许多当代文论基础文本第一版的出版日期，并将它们置于方括号中，这样 就可以使读者看出它们是多早问世的以及它们在后来的种种现代版本中产生的影响。,One notable change in these is the inclusion (in square brackets) of dates of first publication for many of the founding texts of contemporary literary theory in order to indicate how much earlier they often are than the modern editions by which they subsequently made their impact.
9335,出于同样的考虑，那些译入英语的具有原创性的欧陆文本第一版的日期也标示了出来。,"Equally, the date of translation into English of seminal European texts is included for the same reason."
9336,这些观念彻底变革了浪漫主义特别是文艺复兴文学。,These ideas have revolutionized the study of Romantic and especially Renaissance literature.
9336,斯蒂芬·格林布拉特（Stephen Greenblatt）、路易·奥格尔（Louis Montrose）、乔纳森·戈德堡（Jonathan Goldberg）、斯蒂芬·奥格尔（Stephen Orgel ）、奥列纳德·坦纳豪斯（Leonard Tennenhouse）之辈新历史主义者探索了伊丽莎白世代文学文本（特别是戏剧、假面剧、田园诗）如何表达都铎王朝的政治关怀，从而生产并更新了支撑其政体的权利话语。,"New Historicists such as Stephen Greenblatt, Louis Montrose, Jonathan Goldberg, Stephen Orgel and Leonard Tennenhouse explore the ways in which Elizabethan literary texts (especially drama, masque and pastoral) act out the concerns of the Tudor monarchy, reproducing and renewing the powerful discourses which sustain the system."
9336,他们看出，那个君主政体的王朝正是控制权利结构的中枢。,They see the monarchy as the central axis governing the power structure.
9337,沃尔夫的文章一发表后，心理语言学家列能伯格和布朗就指出他的论点中的两个不合理地方。,"As soon as Whorf's articles appeared, the psycholinguists Eric Lenneberg and Roger Brown pointed out two non sequiturs in his argument."
9337,第一就是沃尔夫并没有真正去研究阿帕契人，没存任何证据说他真的碰过阿帕契人;他只研究过阿帕契语的文法，所以这使得他的论点变得拐穹抹角—阿帕契人说话说得不一样，所以他们思考不一样。,"First, Whorf did not actually study any Apaches; it is not clear that he ever met one.His assertions about Apache psychology are based entirely on Apache grammar ——making his argument circular.Apaches speak differently, so they must think differently."
9337,我们怎么知道他们思考是不一样的?,How do we know that they think differently?
9337,只要去听他们讲话的方式就晓得了！,Just listen to the way they speak!
9338,新批评其实是在把诗变为崇拜偶像。,"What New Criticism did, in fact, was to convert the poem into a fetish."
9338,如果说I.A.理查兹已将作品”非物质化“，使之仅仅成为开向诗人心灵的一扇透明窗户，那么，美国新批评价家们却过分将其重新物质化了，使之看来不像那么一种意义过程却更像某种具有四角和水刷石前脸的建筑物，这可颇有反讽意味。,"If I. A. Richards had 'dematerialized' the text, reducing it to a transparent window on to the poet's psyche, the American New Critics rematerialized it with a vengeance, making it seem less like a process of meaning than something with four corners and a pebbledash front."
9338,因为这种诗所抗议的那个社会秩序恰恰充满了这样的”物化“，它们把人、过程和机构统统转变为“东西”。,"This is ironic, since the very social order against which such poetry was a protest was rife with such 'reifications', transforming people, processes and institutions into 'things'."
9339,一般来说，可数/不可数的区分对应于离散物体和同质物质之间的差异。,"Generally, the count/mass distinction corresponds to the difference between discrete objects and homogeneous substances."
9339,认为这种区别的基础在于人类感知的说法是错误的，因为不同语言看待同一物体的方式可能有所不同。,"But it would be incorrect to say that this distinction is grounded in human perception, because different lan- guages may treat the same object differently."
9339,例如，在英语中，hair(头发） 、furniture(家具）和spaghetti(意大利式细面条）是物质名词。,"For example, in English the words hair, furniture, and spaghetti are mass nouns."
9340,说服男孩放弃对母亲的乱伦欲望的是父亲的阉割威胁。,What persuades the boy-child to abandon his incestuous desire for the mother is the father's threat of castration.
9340,这一威胁不必明言，但是男孩发现女孩是“阉割过的”以后，他开始想象这是一个也会落到自己头上的威胁。,"This threat need not necessarily be spoken; but the boy, in perceiving that the girl is herself 'castrated', begins to imagine this as a punishment which might be visited upon himself."
9340,他因而在一种提心吊胆的顺从中压抑自己的乱伦欲望，使自己顺应“现实原则”，向父亲屈服，与母亲疏远，并且安于一种潜意识的慰解，即：虽然现在他没有希望驱逐父亲占有母亲。但是父亲象征了一个地位，一种可能性，这是他自己将来能够占据和实现的。,"He thus represses his incestuous desire in anxious resignation, adjusts himself to the 'reality principle', submits to the father, detaches himself from the mother, and comforts himself with the unconscious consolation that though he cannot now hope to oust his father and possess his mother, his father symbolizes a place, a possibility, which he himself will be able to take up and realize in the furture."
9341,正是这种把文学看成是一种语言，一个自主的、内部连贯的、自我限制的、自我调节的、自我证明的结构的观点，是形式主义批评具有活力的地方，并把它和语言学和人类学中的“结构”运动明显地联系在一起。,"It is this notion of literature as a kind of langue, an autonomous, internally coherent, self-limiting, self-regulating, self-justifying structure, which centrally animates formalist criticism and links it clearly with ‘structural’ developments in linguistics and anthropology."
9341,个别的艺术作品就象一种“言语”同它的母系“语言”发生关系，在这种关系中，一方映照另外一方，同时又为另外一方所映照。,"The individual work of art stands as a sort of parole in relation to its parent langue, a relationship in which each illuminates and is illuminated by the other."
9341,简言之，规则性或曰约定俗成而不容置疑的结构“规则”的实施，其实是文学艺术永葆青春的原则。,"In short, conventionality, the operation of tacit unquestioned structural ‘rules’, emerges as the animating principle of literary art."
9341,不管那种艺术是否自命为“现实主义”，它总是受规则的束缚，这些规则就如象棋规则一样。,"Whether that art has pretensions towards ‘realism’ or not, it remains as ‘bound’ by conventions which act as rules as much as a game of chess does."
9342,我们最熟悉的“动机”类型莫过于通常所谓的“现实主义”了。,The most familiar type of ‘motivation’ is what we usually call ‘realism’.
9342,一部作品，无论它是如何在形式上构成的，我么总期望它给我们对于“真实”的某种幻觉。,"No matter how formally constructed a work may be, we still often expect it to give us the illusion of the ‘real’."
9342,我们指望文学是“栩栩如生的”，作品中那些与我们预期的现实世界的一般看法不相容的人物或描写很可能令我们恼怒。,"We expect literature to be ‘life-like’, and may be irritated by characters or descriptions which fail to match our common-sense expectations of what the real world is like."
9343,赫希眼中牢牢盯住的靶子是海德格尔、加答默尔及其他人的诠释学。,"The target which Hirsch has firmly in his sights is the hermeneutics of Heidegger, Gadamer and others."
9343,对他来说，这些思想家关于意义始终是历史性的这一坚决主张打开了通向完全相对主义的大门。,"For him, the insistence of these thinkers that meaning is always historical opens the door to complete relativism."
9343,根据这种相对主义的论点，一部文学作品能在星期一意谓一种东西，星期五意谓另一种东西。,"On this argument, a literary work can mean one thing on Monday and another on Friday."
9344,我们可以了解前一个时代的档案馆，那是因为我们已经与它距离遥远，与它完全不同。,We can understand an earlier archive only because we are utterly different and remote from it.
9344,例如，当我们阅读文艺复兴时代的文学时，我们常常可以看到它在文辞运用上的华丽丰赡。,"For example, when we read the literature of the Renaissance, we often notice the richness and exuberance of its verbal play."
9344,福柯在《事物的秩序》中阐明，相似性在这个时代所有知识领域中成为核心的结构法则。,"In The Order of Things, Foucault shows that in this period resemblance played a central role in the structure of all knowledges."
9344,每一件事都与别一件事相互回应；没有一件事可以独立于别一件事之外。,Everything echoed everything else; nothing stood on its own.
9344,我们从约翰·邓恩（John Donne）的诗歌中可以清晰而生动地看出这点。邓恩的思绪从不停留在一个客体上，而是来往穿梭于精神与物质、人与神、宇宙与个人之间。,"We see this vividly in the poetry of John Donne, whose mind never rests on an object but moves back and forth from spiritual to physical, human to divine, and universal to individual."
9345,文字的听觉形象属于最为明显的精神经历。,Auditory images of words are among the most obvious of mental happenings.
9345,对大多数人说来，读得很慢的任何一行诗句或散文在想象中默不作声地听起来仿佛跟朗读时的情形一样。,"Any line of verse or prose slowly read, will, for most people, sound mutely in the imagination somewhat as it would if read aloud."
9345,可是读者会产生的形象声音与实际声音之间的相似程度则千变万化。,"But the degree of correspondence between the image-sounds, and the actual sounds that the reader would produce, varies enormously."
9345,和许多人发出文字声音的情形相比之下，他们能够以更大的灵敏度和辨別力去想象文字声音。,Many people are able to imagine word-sounds with greater delicacy and discrimination than they can utter them.
9346,有趣的是，在同样的年龄阶段，儿童手语者也会犯同样的错误。,"Interestingly, at this same age signing children make this same error."
9346,他们在表示“你”时常常手指着自己，而表示“我”时却手指着听话人。,They will point to themselves when they mean “you” and point to the addressee when they mean “I.”
9346,尽管这些特定手势的意义是透明或象似的，但正在习得ASL的儿童还是会犯这种错误，这是因为儿童手语者（与成人手语者一样）把这些代词当作语言符号，而不仅仅是指点的手势。,"Children acquiring ASL make this error despite the transparency or iconicity of these particular signs, because signing children (like signing adults) treat these pronouns as linguistic symbols and not simply as pointing gestures."
9347,象征融合了动与静、混乱内容与有机形式，心灵与世界。,"The symbol fused together motion and stillness, turbulent content and organic form, mind and world."
9347,它的物质形体是绝对精神真理的媒介，认识这一真理的是直接的直觉而非任何艰苦的批评分析过程。,"Its material body was the medium of an absolute spiritual truth, one perceived by direct intuition rather than by any laborious process of critical analysis."
9347,就此而论，象征以一种不容怀疑的方式使这样的真理与心灵接触：或者你看见它，或者你看不见它。,In this sense the symbol brought such truths to bear on the mind in a way which brooked no question: either you saw it or you didn't.
9347,象征是非理性主义的基石，是对合理的批评探究的事先破坏，这些东西自此以后就一直猖獗于文学理论之中。,"It was the keystone of an irrationalism, a forestalling of reasoned critical enquiry, which has been rampant in literary theory ever since."
9347,象征是统一之物；因此，解剖象征——把它拆开来研究它的活动机制——几乎就像试图分析三位一体一样亵渎神灵。,"It was a unitary thing, and to dissect it — to take it apart to see how it worked — was almost as blasphemous as seeking to analyse the Holy Trinity."
9347,象征的所有不同部分都各在自己的从属地位上为了共同利益而自发地一起进行工作。因此，象征，或文学作品本身，在整个19世纪和20世纪一直作为人类社会本身的一个理想模式出现是毫不奇怪的。,"All of its various parts worked spontaneously together for the common good, each in its subordinate place; and it is therefore hardly surprising to find the symbol, or the literary artefact as such, being regularly offered throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries as an ideal model of human society itself."
9348,"感觉到的对立面的最终和解，被列维-斯特劳斯看成是神话和图腾崇拜的目的，它当然也是""哲学”思维的目的。",Reconcilement of perceived opposites has been seen to be the aim of myth and totemism: it is of course also the aim of ‘philosophical’ thought.
9348,他说，哲学家的思维和印第安人表现在图腾体系和神话中的思维显示出相同的愿望，“以完整的形式了解现实的两方面……连续和中断”。,"Both the philosopher’s thinking, and that of the Indian, manifested in totemic systems and myths, show the same desire, says Lévi-Strauss, ‘to apprehend in a total fashion the two aspects of reality . . . continuous and discontinuous’."
9348,碰巧，在称之为象征主义的文学运动中，关于时间的这种相同的“对立”的和解成为诸如T·S•艾略特这些诗人刻意追求的东西。,"It happens that, in respect of the literary movement called Symbolism, reconcilement of the same ‘opposition’ with regard to time formed a central preoccupation of poets such as T. S. Eliot."
9349,米尔说，诗歌“体现在各种象征之中。不论情感以何种形态存在于诗人心中，这些象征总能尽可能准确地把它表现出来”。这一论述是休姆理论的先声，也为从波德莱尔到托·斯·艾略特的象征主义者的创作实践奠定了理论基础。,"Poetry, said Mill, in a phrasing which anticipates T. E. Hulme and lays the theoretical groundwork for the practice of symbolists from Baudelaire through T. S. Eliot, embodies 'itself' in symbols, which are the nearest possible representations of the feeling in the exact shape in which it exists in the poet's mind."
9349,,'
9350,有意思的是，人们现在还不清楚人类的心理分析器是否运用这种回溯策略或并行策略来处理歧义，抑或两种策略并用，或用另外的某种策略。,"Interestingly, it is not established within psycholinguistics whether the human parser uses backtracking or parallelism to deal with ambiguity, or perhaps a combination, or some alternative strategy."
9350,这对心理语言学家而言仍然是难题。,This remains a challenge for psycholinguists.
9350,而解决这个难题却是很困难的，因为人们通常很容易处理歧义，理解说话人想要表达的意义。我们现在也没有见到很多证据证明人们需要做许多额外的工作来处理其他可能的意义。,"Figuring this out is difficult because people usually handle ambiguity and arrive at the intended meaning easily, and we do not see much evidence that they are doing lots of extra work to deal with additional possible meanings."
9350,刁钻的语言学家必须含辛茹苦多年才能找到困扰人类的心理分析器的例子，比如，我们前面讨论过的花园小径句。,Fiendish linguists must toil long and hard to come up with examples like the garden path sentences discussed earlier that confuse the human parser.
9351,本书的探讨将表明，许多概念对于澄清艺术的性质和标准都极有裨益。然而这些概念并非获自对审美事实的简单考察，而似乎是从那些有益的类比物中发掘出来的。这些类比物的属性由于隐喻性的转义而成了艺术作品所固有的属性。,"As this inquiry will indicate, a number of concepts most rewarding in clarifying the nature and criteria of art were not found simply in the examination of aesthetic facts, but seem to have emerged from the exploration of serviceable analogues, whose properties were, by metaphorical transfer, predicated of a work of art."
9351,据此，从新古典主义批评到浪漫主义批评的变迁，可以初步表述为批评术语中典型隐喻的根本变化。,"From this point of view the shift from neo-classic criticism to romantic criticism can be formulated, in a preliminary way, as a radical alteration in the typical metaphors of critical discourse."
9352,但我认为值得强调的是，尽管这个观点还有缺陷，但它仍是一个应该认真对待的观点，在其结论中没有任何荒谬之处。,"I think it is important to stress that, with all its gaps and deficiencies, it is an argument that must be taken seriously.There is nothing at all absurd in the conclusion."
9352,据我看，在西方思想发展的那一特定时期，很有可能产生一种至今并不存在的心理科学。这 种心理学从对人类知识和信念的各种体系的表征问題出发，从这些知识和信念得以组织起来的槪念和隐藏在这些知识和信念底层的原理着手，只有这样，它才进一歩去研究这些系统是如何从一些先天构造和机体——环境相互作用的总和中发展形成的。,"It seems to me quite possible that at that particular moment in the development of Western thought there was the possibility for the birth of a science of psychology of a sort that still does not exist, a psychology that begins with the problem of characterizing various systems of human knowledge and belief, the concepts in terms of which they are organized and the principles that underlie them, and that only then turns to the study of how these systems might have developed through some combination of innate structure and organism – environment interaction."
9352,这种心理学与如下的一种研究人的智慧的方法是冲突的。该方法首先在先验的基琎上假定某种特殊的机制，并宣称，这种机制必定就是位于所有的知识和信念莸得过程的底层的东西。,"Such a psychology would contrast rather sharply with the approach to human intelligence that begins by postulating, on a priori grounds, certain specific mechanisms that, it is claimed, must be those underlying the acquisition of all knowledge and belief."
9353,请考虑行走问题:显然，在“目的性”最一般的意义上讲，行走是有目的的。,"Consider walking: clearly,walking is purposive behavior, in the most general sense of “purposive.”"
9353,亊实上，在刚才定义的意义上讲，行走也是“有句法的”，就象卡尔·莱什（Karl Lashley）很久以前在讨论行为的顺次秩序问题时所指出的那样——我在第一章中曾提到过此。,"Walking is also “syntactic” in the sense just defined, as, in fact, Karl Lashley pointed out a long time ago in his important discussion of serial order in behavior, to which I referred in the first lecture.4"
9353,不仅如此，行走肯定是可以报告信息的。例如，我可以通过我行走的速度和强度来表明我对达到某一目标的兴趣。,"Furthermore, it can certainly be informative; for example, I can signal my interest in reaching a certain goal by the speed or intensity with which I walk."
9354,例如，英语的结构是主语-动词-宾语（SVO)。,"For example, English is a Subject–Verb–Object (SVO) language."
9354,英语例句1合乎语法，因为词都按照正确的顺序排列；例句2不合语法，因为其词序对英语而言不正确。,The English sentence in (1) is grammatical because the words occur in the right order; the sentence in (2) is ungrammatical because the word order is incorrect for English.
9354,（前文说过，句子之前的星号是一项语言学规约，用以表明根据语法规则这个句子不合语法或不合式。）,(Recall that the asterisk or star preceding a sentence is the linguistic convention for indicating that the sentence is ungrammatical or ill-formed according to the rules of the grammar.)
9355,关于语言习得的心理机制有各种各样的说法。,There have been various proposals concerning the psychological mechanisms involved in acquiring a language.
9355,早期的语言习得理论深受行为主义——20世纪50年代盛行的一个心理学派——的影响。,"Early theories of language acquisition were heavily influenced by behaviorism, a school of psychology prevalent in the 1950s."
9355,"顾名思义,行为主义关注的是可以直接观察到的人的行为，而不是支持这些行为的心理系统。","As the name implies, behaviorism focused on people’s behaviors, which are directly observable, rather than on the mental systems underlying these behaviors."
9356,因此，他的“后理论”其实是“更多的理论”，在一种更宏伟、更负责的层面上，向后现代主义逃避的那些更大的问题敞开胸怀。这些问题包括道德、形而上学、爱情、生物学、宗教与革命、恶、死亡与苦难、本质、普遍性、真理、客观性与无功利性等。,"‘After theory’ therefore means more theory, on a grander and more responsible scale, open to the large questions postmodernism has shied away from: of morality and metaphysics, love, biology, religion and revolution, evil, death and suffering, essences, universals, truth, objectivity and disinterestedness."
9356,这就是说，他这个宏大的新构想既包含了一种拓展的马克思主义，也包含了对自由主义某些原则的重新评价。,"This new project embraces, that is to say, both an expanded Marxism and a revaluation of some of the keystones of liberalism."
9357,以“The happy boy eats ice cream.,Take the sentence “The happy boy eats ice cream”.
9357,”为例，它的开头是以3个字放在一起，组成—个单位，我们叫它名词短语-the happy boy。,"It begins with three words that hang together as a unit, the noun phrase “the happy boy”."
9357,"在英文里，名词短语（NP)是由名词(N)前面加一个冠词或限定词 (略写为det),与任何数目的形容词(A)所组成的。","In English a noun phrase (NP) is composed of a noun (N), sometimes preceded by an article or ''determiner'' (abbreviated ''det'') and any number of adjectives (A)."
9357,在语言学上箭头表示由什么组成，括弧表示可用可不用，星号表示随便你要用几次。我讲这些符号的意思是说，上面这些讯息只要用几个符号就可很正确地表达出来了。你可以不必去管这些符号，只要看我们如何转译句子。,"In the standard notation of linguistics, an arrow means ''consists of,'' parentheses mean ''optional,"" and an asterisk means ''as many of them as you want,'' but I provide the rule just to show that all of its information can be captured precisely in a few symbols; you can ignore the notation and just look at the translation into ordinary words below it."
9358,某些动词，例如think（认为），选择句子作为补足语，例如I think that Sam won the race （我认为山姆赢得了赛跑）。,"Some verbs, such as think, select a sentence complement, as in “I think that Sam won the race.”"
9358,其他的动词，例如tell（告诉），选择一个NP和一个句子作为补足语，例如I told Sam that Michael was on his bicycle（我告诉山姆迈克尔骑在自行车上）；然而还有其他动词，例如feel（觉得）或是选择一个AdjP或是选择一个句子作为补足语（斜体是补足语）：They felt strong as oxen.,"Other verbs, like tell, select an NP and a sentence, as in “Itold Sam that Michael was on his bicycle”; yet other verbs like feel select either an AdjP or a sentence complement.(Complements are italicized.)"
9358,（他们觉得自己体壮如牛。）,Paul felt strong as an ox.
9358,They feel that they can win.（他们觉得他们能臝。）,He feels that he can win.
9359,对于词的内部结构和构词规则的研究，就是形态学。,"The study of the internal structure of words, and of the rules by which words are formed, is morphology."
9359,这个词本身就由两个语素构成： morph +ology。,"This word itself consists of two morphemes, morph + ology."
9359,后缀-ology意思是“ 关于……的科学” 或者指“ 有关……的知识分支” 。因此，形态学的意义就是“ 关于词汇形式的科学” 。,"The suffix -ology means “science of” or “branch of knowledge concerning.”Thus, the meaning of morphology is “the science of (word) forms.”"
9360,另一常见的批评是，弗洛伊德“把什么东西都归结为性”——用术语说，他是一个“泛性论者”。,"Another common criticism is that Freud 'brings everything down to sex' — that he is, in the technical term, a 'pan-sexualist'."
9360,这当然是站不住脚的：弗洛伊德是一位非常彻底的二元论思想家，甚至无疑有些过分，而且总是把自我保存的“自我本能”等非性力量与性欲动对立起来。,"This is certainly untenable: Freud was a radically dualistic thinker, no doubt excessively so, and always counterposed to the sexual drives such non-sexual forces as the 'ego-instincts' of self-perservation."
9360,泛性论指责的合理成份在于，弗洛伊德认为性足以成为人类生活的中心，成为我们一切活动的一个构成部分；但这并不是性还原论。,The seed of truth in the pan-sexualist charge is that Freud regarded sexuality as central enough to human life to provide a component of all our activities; but that is not a sexual reductionism.
9361,以为存在着一种单一的“标准”语言，一种由所有社会成员同等分享的通货，这是一种错觉。,"The idea that there is a single 'normal' language, a common currency shared equally by all members of society, is an illusion."
9361,任何实际语言都由极为复杂的各种话语所组成，这些话语由于使用者的阶级、地区、性别身份等等的不同而互有区别。它们不可能被整整齐齐地结合成一个单独的、纯粹的语言共同体。,"Any actual language consists of a highly complex range of discourses, differentiated according to class, region, gender, status and so on, which can by no means be neatly unified into a single homogeneous linguistic community."
9362,米利特借鉴了科学中区分“性”与“性别”的重要观点:“性”是生理决定的特征；而“性别”则是一个心理学概念，它指文化上要求的性别身份。她和其他女性主义者一起抨击那些把文化上习得的“女性”特征（被动性等）看作是“自然”属性的社会科学家。,"Millett borrows from social science the important distinction between ‘sex’ and ‘gender’, where sex is determined biologically but ‘gender’ is a psychological concept which refers to culturally acquired sexual identity, and she and other feminists have attacked social scientists who treat the culturally learned ‘female’ characteristics (passivity, etc.) as ‘natural’."
9362,她认识到，女人同男人一样会使这些态度永久化，而在控制与从属的不平等与压抑关系中扮演这些性角色，她则称之为“性政治”。,"She recognizes that women as much as men perpetuate these attitudes, and the acting-out of these sex-roles in the unequal and repressive relations of domination and subordination is what Millett calls ‘sexual politics’."
9363,“修辞”是古代表示说服艺术的一个经典术语。,‘Rhetoric’ is the classical term for the art of persuasion.
9363,德·曼关注的是修辞学论文中常常提到的“修辞格”( tropes）的理论。“修辞格”允许作家说一样事，但却指另一样事：以一个符号代替另一个（ 隐喻）、把一个链条中符号的意义从一个移至另一个上（换喻）等。,"De Man is concerned with the theory of ‘tropes’which accompanies rhetorical treatises. ‘Figures of speech’ (tropes) allow writers to say one thing but mean something else: to substitute one sign for another (metaphor), to displace meaning from one sign in a chain to another (metonymy), and so on."
9364,不要求学生们去解释这些范例，像我们现在解释文学作品一样去找出它们“到底是关于什么的”。,"Students were not asked to interpret them, as we now interpret literary works, seeking to explain what they are ‘really about’."
9364,相反，学生要能背出这些范例，要研究它们的语法，要能够辨别它们所运用的修辞手段和论证的结构.或者过程。,"On the contrary, students memorized them, studied their grammar, identified their rhetorical figures and their structures or procedures of argument."
9364,比如维吉尔（Virgil)的作品。《埃涅阿斯纪》(Aeneid).如今我们把它作为文学来研究。而在1850年之前的学校里，对它的处理则截然不同。,"A work such as Virgil’s Aeneid, which today is studied as literature, was treated very differently in schools prior to 1850."
9365,"而且,如果“文学”包括很多“事实”作品的话,它也排斥了相当一批虚构作品。","Moreover, if 'literature' includes much 'factual' writing, it also excludes quite a lot of fiction."
9365,"《无敌超人》连环漫画和流行小说是虚构的,但是一般不被视为文学,当然更不会被视为“纯文学”。","Superman comic and Mills and Boon novels are fictional but not generally regarded as literature, and certainly not as literature."
9365,"如果文学是“创造性的”或“想象性的”作品,这是否就意味着历史、哲学与自然科学就是非创造性的和非想象性的作品呢?","If literature is 'creative' or 'imaginative' writing, does this imply that history, philosophy and natural science are uncreative and unimaginative?"
9366,“通常都是通过对自然或天气的描述来造成一种虚幻式结尾……。,‘Usually it is descriptions of nature or of the weather that furnish material for these illusory endings.
9366,这一新的主题往往作为先前发生故事的平行陪衬，故事因此而给人以结束的感觉。,". . . This new motif is inscribed as a parallel to the preceding story, thanks to which the tale seems completed’ (pp. 176–7)."
9366,”对天气的描述可以作为令人满意的结束，因为读者会对它作比喻性或举隅性的阐释，然后把这一主题陈述作为故事中所发生的行为本身的对照。,A description of the weather can provide a satisfactory conclusion because the reader gives it a metaphoric or synecdochic interpretation and then reads this thematic statement against the actions themselves.
9367,然而，俄国形式主义者们强调，只有“情节”（sjuzet）才是严格意义上的文学的，而“故事”（fabula）只是等待作家进行组织的原始材料。,"The Russian Formalists, however, stress that only ‘plot’ (sjuzet) is strictly literary, while ‘story’ (fabula) is merely raw material awaiting the organizing hand of the writer."
9367,正如什克洛夫斯基论斯特恩的文章中所显示的，形式主义者们关于情节的观念比亚里士多德更具有革命性。,"As Shklovsky’s essay on Sterne reveals, the Formalists had a more revolutionary concept of plot than Aristotle."
9367,《商第传》的情节不仅仅是对故事事件的安排，而且是打断和推迟叙述的所有“技巧”。,The plot of Tristram Shandy is not merely the arrangement of story-incidents but also all the ‘devices’ used to interrupt and delay the narration.
9367,转移话题、种种排印上的游戏、书中章节（序、题词等）的错位和扩展的描写等全都是吸引读者注意小说形式的技巧。,
9368,焦点自然集中在叙述的本质上。,"The focus, naturally enough, is on the nature of narrative."
9368,"如果说抒情诗以所谓联想的，“垂直的”方式（索绪尔语）把“陌生化”过程作用于静态的对象和事物，那么，小说中叙述的头等重要性则把一种适合于在短暂的时间内迅速发挥怍用的方式强加给小说，即句段的、“水平的""方式。","If the lyric operates the process of ‘making strange’ on static objects and institutions in what, to use Saussure’s term, could be called an associative, ‘vertical’ mode, the overriding necessity of narrative in the novel forces on it a mode appropriate to its investment in temporality: the syntagmatic, ‘horizontal’ mode."
9368,因为小说最关心的问题是序列，由于时间的流失持续不断，小说不会提供其他事先存在的具体材料来供陌生化的过程发挥作用。,"Because the novel concerns itself centrally with sequence, with the continuous passage of time, it oﬀers no other pre-existing concrete material on which the process of defamiliarization is able to act."
9368,况且，作为和叙述内容相分离的一种形式的小说，是不会有可以支配它的规律的。,"Moreover, there are no laws governing the novel as a form separable from its narrative content."
9369,俄国形式主义叙述理论中的另一个概念是“动机”（motivation）。,A further concept within Russian Formalist narrative theory is ‘motivation’.
9369,托马舍夫斯基把情节中最小的单元叫做“动机”，我们可以把他的“动机”理解为一个单一的陈述或行为。,"Tomashevsky called the smallest unit of plot a ‘motif’, which we may understand as a single statement or action."
9369,他还区分了“确定”动机和“自由”动机。,He makes a distinction between ‘bound’ and ‘free’ motifs.
9369,确定动机是故事要求的，不可缺少的；而“自由”动机从故事的角度看则无关大局，可有可无。,"A bound motif is one which is required by the story, while a ‘free’ motif is inessential from the point of view of the story."
9370,实际上，勃里蒙混淆了阐释代码的活动与选择行为代码的活动。,"Bremond seems, in fact, to have confused the operations of the hermeneutic code with those of the proairetic code."
9370,后者的成分必须作反时间顺序的界定，而前者的成分则是按顺时间顺序加以识别，犹如对悬念或疑案的期待那样。,"Elements of the latter must be deﬁned retrospectively, whereas those of the former are recognized prospectively, as a prospect of suspense or mystery."
9370,如果我们在此对阐释代码再说上几句，我们再回到情节结构的论题时思想准备就会更加充分了。,If we say a word about the hermeneutic code we shall be better prepared to return to plot structure proper.
9371,实际上，《S/Z》中提出的五种代码，也并不是说只有这五种，或五种就足够了。,"And indeed, the five codes isolated in S/Z do not seem exhaustive or sufficient."
9371,选择行为代码（proairetic code）主宰读者对情节的架构。,The proairetic code governs the reader’s construction of plot.
9371,阐释代码（hermeneutic code）包括回答逻辑，谜语与解释，悬念与突变。,"The hermeneutic code involves a logic of question and answer, enigma and solution, suspense and peripeteia."
9371,这些无疑都是小说的组成部分，两者都可以放在情节结构的范畴中考虑。,These are undoubted components of the novel and can both be located in the realm of plot structure.
9371,意胚代码（semic code）为读者提供模式，使其能够收集与人物有关、并能发展人物性格的各种语义特征，而象征代码（symbolic code）则引导从文本中引出象征读义和主题的推论。,"The semic code provides models which enable the reader to collect semantic features that relate to persons and to develop characters, and the symbolic code guides extrapolation from text to symbolic and thematic readings."
9372,在一种明显的意义上说，心理学的任何一个方面最终都是建立在对行为的观察上的。,There is an obvious sense in which any aspect of psychology is based ultimately on the observation of behavior.
9372,但这根本不等于说，对学习过程的研究就应该直接着手调查控制行为的因素，或“行为储备库”得以被建立起来的种种条件。,But it is not at all obvious that the study of learning should proceed directly to the investigation of factors that control behavior or of conditions under which a “behavioral repertoire” is established.
9372,首先必须的倒是确定这个“行为储备库”重要特征以及把它组织起来的原理。,"It is first necessary to determine the significant characteristics of this behavioral repertoire, the principles on which it is organized."
9373,事实上并不存在任何归纳步骤或者联想，有希望从现有的资料中导出这种原理，除非我们以某种方式把循环应用原理引入“归纳步骤”——当然这是一种诡辩。,"In fact, there is no procedure of induction or association that offers any hope of leading from such data as is available to a principle of this sort (unless, begging the question, we introduce the principle of cyclic application into the “inductive procedure” in some manner)."
9373,"因此，以下的结论似乎是有根据的,语音规则的循环应用原理是普通语法的一种天赋的组织原理；该原理用于确定语言经验的特性，并用于构造一种作为所获得的语言知识的语法。","Therefore, the conclusion seems warranted that the principle of cyclic application of phonological rules is an innate organizing principle of universal grammar that is used in determining the character of linguistic experience and in constructing a grammar that constitutes the acquired knowledge of language."
9373,同时，这种普遍语法原理也为例27中的那类现象提供了一种解释。,"At the same time, this principle of universal grammar offers an explanation for such phenomena as were noted in 27."
9374,弗洛伊德评论说，unheimlich往往在这样或那样的意义上成为heimlich 的亚种（见1974年版《弗洛伊德全集》第17 卷，第226页）。,"‘“Unheimlich”’, Freud comments, ‘is in some way or another a subspecies of “Heimlich”’ (1974, vol. 17: 226)."
9374,弗洛伊德进一步将“讶异”和下述两方面的意思相关联， 一是一个“原始人”无意识中的遗留及其后来压抑的那种动物性的、神话的、神秘的世界观； 二是重复、偶合与极端类似的发生。,"Freud further relates the uncanny, first to the survival in the unconscious of a ‘primitive’ and subsequently repressed animistic mythological and mystic view of the world; and second, to the occurrence of repetitions, coincidences and doubles."
9374,他把这第二方面的意思理解为婴幼阶段被压抑的经验造成的。,This latter he understands as the result of repressed experiences in infancy.
9375,卢梭在写“语言是为说而存在的；写作只能作为言语的补充”时正是继承了这种传统，而且它已经成为一种常识。德里达在这里插入了问题“补充是什么？” 《韦伯斯特大词典》对该词的定义是“使完整，或者增补内容”。,"Rousseau follows this tradition, which has passed into common sense, when he writes, ‘Languages are made to be spoken; writing serves onlyas a supplement to speech.’ Here Derrida intervenes, asking ‘what is a supplement?’ Webster’s defines supplement as ‘something that completes or makes an addition’."
9375,那么写作是不是通过提供一些被遗漏的重要内容面使言语变得“完整”呢？还是增加了一些言语言本能身完全可以表达的内容呢？,"Does writing ‘complete’ speech by supplying something essential that was missing, or does it add something that speech could perfectly well do without?"
9376,很难想像是什么祥的处境会使一个人以这种方式说话，或者他们做出什么样的非诗歌的行动。,It is hard to imagine what sort of situation would lead someone to speak in this way or what non-poetic act they would be performing.
9376,我们有可能想出这样的答案：这些说话人都被深深地迷住了，变得惊人地诗化，并且过分地装腔作势。,
9376,,"The answer we are likely to come up with is that these speakers are getting carried away and waxing poetical, extravagantly posturing."
9376,如果我们把这种诗篇作为对普通言语行为的虚构性模仿去理解，那么这种行为似乎应该是对诗歌本身的模仿。,"If we try to understand these poems as fictional imitations of ordinary speech acts, the act seems to be that of imitating poetry itself."
9377,言语行为理论本身及其作为文学的模式都存在一些问题。,"There are problems with speech act theory, both in itself and as a model of literature."
9377,我们不清楚，这样的理论最终能否避免偷用现象学中陈旧的“意向主体”以稳固自身。此外，这一理论所关注的语言似乎停留在法律的不良层面，即谁能够在什么情况下对谁说什么的问题。,"It is not clear that such theory can finally avoid smuggling in the old 'intending subject' of phenomenology in order to anchor itself, and its preoccupations with language seem unhealthily juridical,a matter of who is allowed to say what to whom in what conditions"
9378,"如果一个词有概念上或者历史渊源上相互联系的多个意义，它就被称为是“一词多义的” (polysemous,发音是polly-seamus)。","When a word has multiple meanings that are related conceptually or historically, it is said to be polysemous (polly-seamus)."
9378,举例来说，diamond—词既指一种几何形状（菱形），又指有这种几何形状的棒球场地，它就是一词多义的。,"For example, the word diamond referring to a geometric shape and also to a baseball field that has that shape is polysemous."
9378,打开一部英语词典的任何一页，你会发现许多词的定义不止一个（例如，guard “卫兵/保护”，finger“手指/指认”和overture“序曲/友好姿态”）。,"Open a dictionary of English to any page and you will find words with more than one definition (e.g., guard, finger, overture)."
9378,这些词都是一词多义，因为每个词都有几个相互联系的意义。,Each of these words is polysemous because each has several related meanings.
9379,相对于他们最终掌握的成人语法的复杂性而言，他们习得语言的过程很快，但也不是瞬间完成的。,"Relative to the complexity of the adult grammar that they eventually attain, the process of language acquisition is fast, but it is not instantaneous."
9379,从会说第一批词到实际具备成人的语言能力需要三到四年时间，其间要经历若干个语言阶段。,"From first words to virtual adult competence takes three to five years, during which time children pass through linguistic stages."
9379,起初是咿呀语，然后习得第一批词，再过几个月就开始遣词造句了。,"They begin by babbling, they then acquire their first words, and in just a few months they begin to put words together into sentences."
9380,但是，也有一些组构性不起作用的有趣例子，有的是因为词出了问题，有的则是因为语义规则有问题。,"There are, however, interesting cases in which compositionality breaks down, either because there is a problem with words or with the semantic rules."
9380,如果一句话里有一个或几个词没有意义，那么显然整句话都无法计算出意义来。,"If one or more words in a sentence do not have a meaning, then obviously we will not be able to compute a meaning for the entire sentence."
9380,此外，就算每个词都有意义，但是无法根据句法结构和相关语义规则的要求组合起来，那么也无法得出句子的意义。,"Moreover, even if the individual words have meaning but cannot be combined together as required by the syntactic structure and related semantic rules, we will also not get to a meaning."
9380,我们把这些情况称为语义异常。,We refer to these situations as semantic anomaly.
9381,例如，大脑的布罗卡区受损的病人，可能患上布罗卡失语症，它常造 成患者的句法障碍和语法缺失。,"For example, lesions in the part of the brain called Broca’s area may suffer from Broca’s aphasia, which results in impaired syntax and agrammatism."
9381,韦尼克区受损的病人，则可能患上韦尼克失语症，患者说流利但语义异常的话语。更严重的是杂乱性失语症，患者说无意义的语言形式，因此无从理解。,"Damage to Wernicke’s area may result in Wernicke’s aphasia, in which fluent speakers produce semantically anomalous utterances, or even worse, jargon aphasia, in which speakers produce nonsense forms that make their utterance uninterpretable."
9382,调音部位、方式相同的语音有可能长短不同。,Speech sounds that are identical in their place or manner features may differ in length (duration).
9382,英语中紧元音一般比松元音长，不过只是稍长一点，大约几十毫秒。但在有些语言中长元音可能长出一倍，这能用来区别词义。,"Tense vowels are slightly longer than lax vowels, but only by a few milliseconds.However, in some languages when a vowel is prolonged to around twice its normal length, it can make a difference between words."
9382,"例如 日语中biru[biru]是“建筑”，如果是长i，biiru[bi:ru],那就是“啤酒”了（形如冒号的：是IPA表示音段长或者音程加倍的符号。）","In Japanese the word biru [biru] with a regular i means “building,” but with the i doubled in length as in biiru, spelled phonetically as [biːru], the meaning is “beer.” (The colon-like ː is the IPA symbol for segment length or doubling.) In Japanese vowel length can make the difference between two words."
9383,说话时还会改变音高。,"When we speak, we also change the pitch of our voice."
9383,音高取决于声带振动的快慢，振动快，音高就高。,"The pitch depends on how fast the vocal cords vibrate; the faster they vibrate, the higher the pitch."
9383,女性和孩童的喉头较小，声带较短，振动就快，音高也高，当然其他条件都相同的话。,"If the larynx is small, as in women and children, the shorter vocal cords vibrate faster and the pitch is higher, all other things being equal."
9383,那就是为什么女人和小孩的声音一般比男人来的高的原因。,"That is why women and children have higher-pitched voices than men, in general."
9384,在第六章中，通过声调语言与语调语言的比较，我们讨论了作为语音特征的音高。,"In chapter 6, we discussed pitch as a phonetic feature in reference to tone languages and intonation languages."
9384,在这一章中我们又讨论了区别词义的音高特征。,In this chapter we have discussed the use of phonetic features to distinguish meaning.
9384,现在我们知道，在汉语、泰语以及阿肯语这样的声调语言中，音高是一个音位特征。,"We can now see that pitch is a phonemic feature in tone languages such as Chinese, Thai, and Akan."
9384,我们将这些相对音高称为区别性声调。,We refer to these relative pitches as contrasting tones.
9384,在英语那种语调语言中，表现为短语或句子的音高曲拱或语调的音高依然起着重要作用。,"In intonation languages such as En glish, pitch still plays an important role, but in the form of the pitch contour or intonation of the phrase or sentence."
9385,两个语音形式若要区别意义并使之对立，那么在替换的音素之间必须有某种语音差别。,"For two phones to contrast meaning, there must be some phonetic difference between them."
9385,最小对比对seal (图章)和 zeal (热心)表明，[s]和 [z]在英语中代表两个对立音位。,The minimal pairs seal [sil] and zeal [zil] show that [s] and [z] represent two contrasting phonemes in English.
9385,它们不是同一音位的音位变体，因为把s替换为z不可能不改变词义。,They cannot be allophones of one phoneme because one cannot replace the [s] with the [z] without changing the meaning of the word.
9385,"此外,它们也不处于互补分布；这两个音都可以出现在词首，元音i的前面。","Furthermore, they are not in complementary distribution; both occur word initially before the vowel [i]."
9385,因此，它们是两个对立的音位/s/和/z/的音位变体。,They are therefore allophones of the two different phonemes /s/ and /z/.
9386,音位表征是最低限度刻画的，因为有些特征或特征值是可预测的。,The phonemic representations are minimally specified because some features or feature values are predictable.
9386,例如，在英语中所有的鼻辅音都是带声的，所以我们不用在鼻音的特征矩阵中特别说明带声这一条。,"For example, in English all nasal consonants are voiced, so we don’t need to specify voicing in the phonemic feature matrix for nasals."
9386,同样的，我们也不用特别说明非低后元音的圆唇特征。,"Similarly, we don’t need to specify the feature round for non-low back vowels."
9387,在描写这些单位的时候，送气并没有作为一个音位特征列出。因为在描写音位时区别p和ph并非必要。,"Aspiration is not listed as a phonemic feature in the specification of these units, because it is not necessary to include both [p] and [ph] as phonemes."
9387,但在语音描写中，送气特征必须在其出现的地方标明。,"In a phonetic transcription, however, the aspiration feature would be specified where it occurs."
9388,谚文字母是根据音位原则来设计的。,The Hangul alphabet was designed on the phonemic principle.
9388,虽然韩语中有[1]和[r]这两个音，世宗却只用一个字母来代表它们，因为它们是同一音位的音位变体(见第七章练习3)。,"Although Korean has the sounds [l] and [r], Seijong represented them by a single letter because they are allophonic variants of the same phoneme.(See exercise 3, chapter 7.)"
9388,[s]和[ʃ]，[ts]和[tʃ]也是同样的情况。,"The same is true for the sounds [s] and [ʃ], and [ts] and [tʃ]."
9389,音系规则的相互作用可以导致词汇变化，例如名词 house (房屋）和 bath (洗澡）曾有别于动词 house (给房子住）和 bathe (洗澡），后者以短元音结尾。,An interaction of phonological rules may result in changes in the lexicon.The nouns house and bath were once differentiated from the verbs house and bathe by the fact that the verbs ended with a short vowel sound.
9389,上面提到的将[f]在元音之间转变为[v]的那条规则，也将处于元音之间的/s/和/θ/转变成其音位变体[z]和[ð]。,"Furthermore, the same rule that realized /f/ as [v] between vowels also realized /s/ and /θ/ as the allophones [z] and [ð] between vowels."
9389,这条普通的规则使处于元音之间的擦音浊化。,This general rule added voicing to intervocalic fricatives.
9389,因此，动词 house中的/s/就发为[z]，同样，/θ/在动词bathe中发为[ð]。,"Thus the /s/ in the verb house was pronounced [z], and the /θ/ in the verb bathe was pronounced [ð]."
9390,元音和辅音的长度在英语中无对立。,"In English, vowel length and consonant length are nonphonemic."
9390,你在说英语词时维持它的元音——即把元音拉长一一词义并不改变。,Prolonging a sound in English will not produce a different word.
9390,不过，在其他语言中，元音音长是不可预见的，一个元音是长还是短能够区别意义。,"In other languages, long and short vowels that are identical except for length are phonemic.In such languages, length is a nonpredictable distinctive feature."
9391,当会话准则在一个情景中得到遵守，其中发生的话段所伴随的推断称为隐涵。,Implicatures are the inferences that may be drawn from an utterance in context.
9391,隐涵的真值取决于话语中的句子，这一点和衍推一样。不同的是，衍推必然为真，而隐涵却可以用后加的信息加以取消。,"Implicatures are like entailments in that their truth follows from sentences of the discourse, but unlike entailments, which are necessarily true, implicatures may be cancelled by information added later."
9392,如果优选论是正确的，且普遍音系限制存在于不同语言中，其排序各不相同，则音系规则就像句法规则一样，受到普遍原则的限制。,"If Optimality Theory is correct, and universal phonological constraints exist that differ among languages only in their rankings, then phonological rules, like syntactic rules, are constrained by universal principles."
9392,语言间限制排序的不同，在某种程度上与第四章中讨论的不同语言中的不同句法参数设置是平行的。,"The differ- ences in constraint rankings across languages are in some ways parallel to the different parameter settings that exist in the syntax of different languages, also discussed in chapter 4."
9392,我们注意到儿童在获得其语言的句法时，必须将其普遍语法的参数值设置为合乎其语言环境的值。,"We noted that in acquiring the syntax of her language, the young child must set the parameters of UG at the values that are correct for the language of the environment."
9392,与此类似，在获得其语言的音系时，儿童必须按照接受的语言来决定正确的限制排序。,"Similarly, in acquiring the phonology of her language, the child must determine the correct constraint rankings as evidenced in the input language."
9393,通常我们问How high is the mountain?(那座山有多高？），而不是How low is it?(它有多低？,"We ask, ordinarily, “How high is the mountain?” (not“How low is it?”)."
9393,）。回答时，则说Ten thousand feet(—万英尺高），而绝不会说Ten thousand feet low(―万英尺坪），除非是出于幽默或讽刺。,"We answer “Ten thousand feet high” but never “Ten thousand feet low,”except humorously or ironically."
9393,因此，high (高）是high/low(高/低）中无标记的成员。,Thus high is the unmarked member of high/low.
9393,.与此类似，tall(高）也tall/short(高/矮）中无标记的成员，fast(快）则是fast/slow(快/慢)中无标记的成员。,"Similarly, tall is the unmarked member of tall/short, fast the unmarked member of fast/slow, and so on.Another kind of opposite involves pairs"
9394,从这一观点出发，我们可以把批评文字划为两大类别。,From this point of view one can distinguish two general categories into which critical works may be grouped.
9394,第一类把一部作品，或一组作品看成是一种语言，将它的研究对象看作一个系统，其规则和形式必须加以阐释。,"The first type, based on the metaphor which makes a work or a group of works a language, treats its object as a system whose rules and forms must be elucidated."
9394,这种批评与较为传统的研究，诸如把具体作品当作“有机统一体”对待，或把某一作家的作品当作同一创作方案的不同变体等，有明显的相似之处，但是，又有所区别，或许由于所谓的“系统的精神”使它充满生气，以及它不愿从事物的同一性上确立联系，而试图从差异类比的基础上确立联系。,"Criticism of this kind has marked affinities with more traditional studies which treat individual works as ‘organic wholes’ or the works of a given author as the variants of a single project, but it may perhaps be distinguished by the ‘esprit de système’ which animates it and its willingness to establish relations that are based not on identity of substance but homology of differences."
9395,在奇温久语这个语言中，它的用格和英语的与格是很像的。布蕾丝南注意到：“可以相像到西洋棋种的下棋者与棋局的关系。,"The corresponding Kivunjo construction is called the applicative, whose resemblance to the English dative, Bresnan notes, ''can be likened to that of the game of chess to checkers."
9395,”奇温久语的语言结构完全在动词内部，包括7个字首词和语尾词、2个陈述语气、14种时态。动词必须要随着主语、受词、它的动作接受者而变化，而每一种又有16个性……,""" The Kivunjo construction is entirely inside the verb, which has seven prefixes and suffixes, two moods, and fourteen tenses; the verb agrees with its subject, its object, and its benefactive nouns, each of which comes in sixteen genders."
9396,甚至在象莱昂纳多•布龙菲尔德这样高水平学者的主要著作《语言论》中，他对哲学语法的解说与其原义也几乎毫无相同之处，倒是符合与原义正相反的传统观点。,"Even a scholar with such high standards as Leonard Bloomfield gives an account of philosophical grammar in his major work, Language, that bears almost no resemblance to the original and attributes to this tradition views diametrically opposed to those that were most typical of it."
9396,例如，布龙菲尔德和其他许多人把哲学语法说成是基于拉丁语模式的规范语法，对言语的声音不感兴趣，而对言语和书面语的混淆却能容忍。,"For example, Bloomfield and many others describe philosophical grammar as based on a Latin model, as prescriptive, as showing no interest in the sounds of speech, as given to a confusion of speech with writing."
9396,所有这些指责都是不实之词。清除这些虚妄的假象，并尽可能客观地评价哲学语法的实际成就是很重要的。,"All these charges are false, and it is important to dispel these myths to make possible an objective evaluation of what was actually accomplished."
9397,就计算机而言，处理这种歧义句子的另一种方式是尝试对平行语句进行穷尽式的语法分析。,Another way to handle such ambiguous situations is for the computer to try every parse that the grammar allows in parallel.
9397,只有处理成功的语法分析才被认为有效的。,Only parses that finish are accepted as valid.
9397,用这种策略来分析The Russian women loved died 这个句子，就会有两种语法分析方法并行展开。一种把Russian看作形容词(俄罗斯的)，另一种则把它看作名词(俄罗斯人)。,"In such a strategy, two parses of The Russian women loved died would be explored simultaneously: Russian would be an adjective in one and a noun in the other."
9397,前一种分析方法一直可以处理到The Russian women loved (这些俄罗斯女人爱慕)，再往后就处理不了了，因为died(死了)不能出现在动词短语中的那个位置上。,The adjective parse would get as far as The Russian women loved but then fAn introduction to language since died cannot occur in that position of a verb phrase.
9398,"例如，语法分析程序中可能包含如下规则：S→NP VP，NP→DetN,等等。","For example, a parser may contain the following rules: S → NP VP, NP → Det N, and so forth."
9398,假设要求计算机分析The child found the kittens (这小孩发现了这些小猫)自上而下分析程序会首先查寻语法规则，然而检查输入的词汇串的第一个词是否能够启动一个句子(S)。如果输入的词汇串的第一个词是限定词(Det)，如前面的例句那样，那么查寻就是成功的，分析程序会继续查找名词(N)，然后再查找动词短语(VP)。,"Suppose the machine is asked to parse The child found the kittens.A top-down parser proceeds by first consulting the grammar rules and then examining the input string to see if the first word could begin an S. If the input string begins with a Det, as in the example, the search is successful, and the parser continues by looking for an N, and then a VP."
9399,哲学语法学家突出地强调，各种语言在深层结构上几乎没有什么不同，虽然在表层可能显示出很大的变化。,"Philosophical grammarians had typically maintained that languages vary little in their deep structures, though there may be wide variability in surface manifestations."
9399,于是，按照这种观点，就存在着一种关于语法关系和范畴的底层结构；而且，人类的思维和心态的某些方面是不因语言的不同而变化的，虽然，人类的语言可能是不一样的。例如，在表达语法关系的形式方面，究竟是用曲折变化还是词序，人类语言可能会有所差别。,"Thus there is, in this view, an underlying structure of grammatical relations and categories, and certain aspects of human thought and mentality are essentially invariant across languages, although languages may differ as to whether they express the grammatical relations formally by inflection or word order, for example."
9400,德里达说，可以以这个方式把语法学看成书面符号的科学，（他声称)东方社会一直是以这个方式看待书写的。,"Grammatology, says Derrida, would be the science of the written sign conceived  in  this  way:  the  way  in  which  writing  has  always  been conceived (he claims) in oriental societies."
9400,语法学的术语、条件和前提和以口语占支配地位的语言不同，它们是关于书写本身。,"Its terms, its conditions, its resuppositions, are not those of a dominant oral version of language, but those of writing itself."
9400,它不是作为声音的替代品，不是以口头的方式，而是以清晰易读的视觉方式传达信息，正如我们已经看到的，它的方式和克里斯坦•布鲁克-罗斯的小说《穿过》相同。,"It communicates, not as a surrogate for the voice,  not  orally,  but  visually  and  legibly,  in  the  way  that,  as  we  have seen,  Christine  Brooke-Rose’s  novel  THRU  does."
9400,这类书写(我们想到乔伊斯贝克特马拉梅、罗布-格里耶和更早的斯特恩等人的作品）需要一种真正适合其本质的文学批评。,"And  writing  of  this kind  (the  work  of  authors  such  as  Joyce,  Becket,  Mallarmé,  Robbe-Grillet  and,  earlier,  Sterne  come  to  mind)  demands  a  criticism genuinely suited to its nature."
9401,非虚构的话语一般包含在那种告诉你如何理解它的语境之中。比如一份指导如何烧莱的菜谱，一篇报纸上的报告，慈善机构的一封来信等等。,"Non-fictional discourse is usually embedded in a context that tells you how to take it: an instruction manual, a newspaper report, a letter from a charity."
9401,然而，虚构的语境对故事到底要说明什么意义这个问题总是不做明确答复。,"The context of fiction, though, explicitly leaves open the question of what the fiction is really about."
9401,与真实世界的关系并非文学被阐释所赋予的功能。,Reference to the world is not so much a property of literary works as a function they are given by interpretation.
9401,"如果我对一位朋友说：“请明天晚上8点钟到大岩石餐馆来和我一起吃晚饭。”她或他会把这作为真正的邀请，并且从该言语语境中判断出具体时间和地点（“明天""指2002年1月14日，“8”点指东部标准时间的晚上8点钟)。","If I tell a friend,‘Meet me for dinner at the Hard Rock Café at eight tomorrow,’ he or she will take this as a concrete invitation and identify spatial and temporal referents from the context of utterance (‘tomorrow’ means 14 January 2002, ‘eight’ mean 8 p.m.Eastern Standard Time)."
9401,然而，如果诗人本·琼森写了一首“邀请朋友去晚餐”的诗，那么这首诗的虚构性就使它与真实世界的关系成为一个有待解释的问题。这个信息的语境是一个文学语境，因此我们必须做出判断，是把这首诗理解成主要勾画虚构的陈述人的态度，还是理解成对一种逝去生活方式的概述，或者认为它是要说明友谊和单纯的快乐对人获得幸福是最重要的。,"But when the poet Ben Jonson writes a poem ‘Inviting a Friend to Supper’, the fictionality of this work makes its relation to the world a matter of interpretation: the context of the message is a literary one and we have to decide whether to take the poem as primarily characterizing the attitudes of a fictional speaker, outlining a bygone way of life, or suggesting that friendship and simple pleasures are what is most important to human happiness."
9402,对美国英语口头材料也进行了一次与此类似的分析，但结果有所不同。,A similar analysis of spoken American English produced somewhat different results.
9402,这次的十大“赢家”是：I，and，the，to，that，you，it，of，a和know，所占比例接近30%。,"The “winners” were I, and, the, to, that, you, it, of, a, and know, accounting for nearly 30 percent."
9402,这还只是通过语料库分析证实的口语和书面语之间的许多区别之一。,This is but one of the differences between spoken and written language demonstrated by corpus analysis.
9403,那些有着不同语素变体的最小对比对对我们的研究尤其有用。,Minimal pairs whose members take different allomorphs are particularly useful for our search.
9403,例如，考虑cab [kæb]和cap [kæp]，其复数形式的语素变体分别为[z]和[s]。,"For example, consider cab [kæb] and cap [kæp], which respectively take the allomorphs [z] and [s] to form the plural."
9403,很明显，两者只有最后一个音段不同，因此最后一个音段才是导致不同语素变体的原因。,"Clearly, the final segment is responsible, because that is where the two words differ."
9403,bag [bæg]和badge [bædʒ]也同样如此。,Similarly for bag [bæg] and badge [bædʒ].
9403,它们的最后一个音段决定了它们有不同的语素变体[z]和[əz]。,Their final segments determine the different plural allomorphs [z] and [əz].
9404,当图画变得不再那么一目了然时， 图画文字就成了表意文字，其意义引申为与原先描绘的物体相关的概念。,"Pictograms are called ideograms when the drawing becomes less literal, and the meaning extends to concepts associated with the object originally pictured."
9404,当表意文字与代表所表达的概念的词联系起来时，就被称为语素文字。,"When ideograms become associ- ated with the words for the concepts they signify, they are called logograms."
9404,语素文字构成的表语文字是真正的文字系统，因为其符号代表了语言中的词。,Logographic systems are true writing systems in the sense that the symbols stand for words of a language.
9405,语言学理论不仅要描写成人说话者关于自己语言的知识，而且要解释这一知识是怎么习得的。,"Linguistic theory is concerned not only with describing the knowledge that an adult speaker has of his or her language, but also with explaining how that knowledge is acquired."
9405,所有正常的儿童显然都能在相对较短的时间内很容易地习得（至少一种）语言。,All normal children acquire (at least one) language in a relatively short period with apparent ease.
9405,而他们甚至不需要父母或照料者提供任何具体的语言辅导，就能做到这一点。,They do this despite the fact that parents and other caregivers do not provide them with any specific language instruction.
9405,人们常说，儿童习得语言，似乎只是听听周围的人说话，就可以“信手拈来”。,"Indeed, it is often remarked that children seem to “pick up” language just from hearing it spoken around them."
9406,句法规则反映的是句子中词、词序以及层级结构之间的关系。,Syntactic rules reveal the grammatical relations among the words of a sentence as well as their order and hierarchical organization.
9406,句法规则也阐释词的分组如何与其意义相关，比如什么时候一个句子或者短语会有歧义。,"They also explain how the grouping of words relates to its meaning, such as when a sentence or phrase is ambiguous."
9406,除此之外，句法规则让说话者得以说出或理解之前从未说过或听过的无限量的句子，这就是语言知识的创造性。,"In addition, the rules of the syntax permit speakers to pro- duce and understand a limitless number of sentences never produced or heard before—the creative aspect of linguistic knowledge."
9407,如果要说讲意大利语的人和讲英语的人对头发、家具、意大利式细面条有不同的认知，我们就不得不假设一种激进形式的语言决定论（请回忆第一章中的萨丕尔-沃尔夫假说）。,"We would have to assume a radical form of linguistic determinism (remember the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis from chapter 1) to say that Italian and English speakers have different perceptions of hair, furniture, and spaghetti."
9407,更合理的假设是，对于所指相同的词，各种语言给它们所指派的语义特征，会有某种程度的差异，并不取决于这些语言将所指概念化的方式。,"It is more reasonable to assume that languages can differ to some extent in the semantic features they assign to words with the same referent, somewhat independently of the way they conceptualize that referent."
9407,即使在一种特定语言内部，也会有不同的词—可数的和不可数的都有--描述同一物体或物质。,Even within a particular language we can have different words—count and mass—to describe the same object or substance.
9408,结构主义音位学的成就在于，它表明：许多种不同语言的音位规则适用于几类元素；这些元素只用上述的 那些特征就可以说明；历史的变化以统一的方式影响着这类元素；上述特征的组织在语言的运用和习得方面具有根本性的作用。,The achievement of structuralist phonology was to show that the phonological rules of a great variety of languages apply to classes of elements that can be simply characterized in terms of these features; that historical change affects such classes in a uniform way; and that the organization of features plays a basic role in the use and acquisition of language.
9408,这是最重要的一个发现。它为现代语言学的绝大部分奠定了基础。,"This was a discovery of the greatest importance, and it provides the groundwork for much of contemporary linguistics."
9408,但如果我们抽走了这组明确的和普通的特征以及这些特征在其中发挥作用的规则系统，那也就没有什么有意义的东西留下来了。,"But if we abstract away from the specific universal set of features and the rule systems in which they function, little of any significance remains."
9409,代词可以用来替代前面话语中的名词短语，或者用来指称假定话语的参与者知道的实体。,Pronouns may be used to refer to entities previously mentioned in discourse or to entities that are presumably known to the participants of a discourse.
9409,如果这个假定不成立，就可能导致本节开头处的那种沟通错误。,"When that presumption fails, miscommunication such as the one at the head of this section may result."
9409,在一段话语中，上文的语言语境在解释代词的意义时起到主要作用。,"In a discourse, prior linguistic context plays a primary role in pronoun interpretation."
9410,在我看来，所谓人类语言学已经推翻了普遍语法假设的信念，在两个重要方面是很虚妄的。,The belief that anthropological linguistics has demolished the assumptions of universal grammar seems to me to be quite false in two important respects.
9410,首先，这个信念误解了古典唯理主义的语法观点。古典唯理主义语法认为，不同的语言只是在较深的层次上—在语法关系得到表达、语言运用的创造性得以实现的层次上—才是相同的；其次，这种信念严重误解了人类语言学的发现。事实上，人类语言学几乎完全把自己局限在语言结构的表层。,"First, it misinterprets the views of classical rationalist grammar, which held that languages are similar only at the deeper level, the level at which grammatical relations are expressed and at which the processes that provide for the creative aspect of language use are to be found.Second, this belief seriously misinterprets the findings of anthropological linguistics, which has, in fact, restricted itself almost completely to fairly superficial aspects of language structure."
9411,为了获得言语理解，计算机会反复尝试从它的语义表征库中找出适合输入语言的词汇和结构的概念。,"To achieve speech understanding, the computer tries to find concepts in its semantic representation capabilities that fit the words and structures of the input."
9411,当技术员说I need to fix the RS111 circuit  (我需要修好电路RS111)，系统会确认I指使用者，need 表示使用者缺少的东西，而计算机必须为他提供。,"When the technician says I need to fix the RS111 circuit, the system recognizes that I means the user, that need represents something that the user lacks and the computer must provide."
9411,计算机还知道如果修理是需要的东西，那么它就必须提供某物的运作信息。,"It further knows that if fixing is what is needed, it has to provide information about the workings of something."
9412,我们的语义规则必须对单个词的意义和它们所出现的结构敏感。,Our semantic rules must be sensitive not only to the meaning of individual words but to the structure in which they occur.
9412,"举个简单的例子，“杰克游泳”,看看语义规则怎样计算这个句子的意义。","Taking as an example our simple sentence Jack swims, let us see how the semantic rules compute its meaning."
9412,我们从每个词的意义开始。单个词的意义总结如下：词义杰克指的是（或者意义是)个体杰克游泳指的是（或者意义是）游泳的个体的集合,The meanings of the individual words are summarized as follows:Word   MeaningsJack   refers to (or means) the individual Jackswims  refers to (or means) the set of individuals that swim
9413,把词义分解为语义特征，能够阐明特定的词是如何与其他词相关联的。,Decomposing the meanings of words into semantic features can clarify how certain words relate to other words.
9413,举例来说，反义词的基本特性，就是除了一个语义特征之外，它们共同具有双方全部的语义特征。,"For example, the basic property of an tonyms is that they share all but one semantic feature."
9413,我们知道big(大）和red(红）不是反义词，因为它们共同的语义特征太少。,We know that big and red are not antonyms because they have too few semantic features in common.
9413,两者都是形容词，但big有一个“关于尺寸”的语义特征，而red则有一个“关于颜色”的语义特征。,"They are both adjectives, but big has a semantic feature “about size,” whereas red has a semantic feature “about color.”"
9414,然而，这样的希望，无论构思得多么美妙，却始终是空想。,"Such hopes, however well-founded, have been vain."
9414,语义学还没有发展到能够描述文本意义的阶段，甚至还没有实现它给自己确立的更小的目标。,"Semantics has not yet reached the stage where it can characterize the meaning of a text, and even the more modest goals it has set for itself have scarcely been achieved."
9414,凯兹和福多尔和大多数转换语法学家一样，由于他们谦卑的理论主张而不为人知，他们认为语义学的任务是描述说话者语言能力的有选择的某些方面：他确定语句本意的能力，认识同义语句的能力，和屏弃非规范读义的能力。,"Katz and Fodor, who like most transformational grammarians are not known for the modesty of their theoretical claims, see the task of semantics as that of describing selected aspects of a speaker's competence: his ability to determine the literal meaning of sentences, to recognize synonymous sentences and to reject anomalous readings."
9415,"与语义引导一样, 分配证据并不是万无一失的。","Like semantic bootstrapping, the distributional evidence is not foolproof."
9415,"例如, “it __ the” 可以表达一个动词, “it hit the ball”（它击中球）, 也可以表达一个介词, “I hit it across the street”（我把它踢到街道对面）。","For example, “it __ the” can frame a verb, it hit the ball, but also a preposition, I hit it across the street."
9415,"但也像语义引导一样, 这个证据可以足够可靠, 让孩子开始学习词汇的句法范畴这一复杂任务。","And also like semantic bootstrapping, this evidence may well be reliable enough to give the child a head start into the complex task of learning the syntactic categories of words."
9416,以下是刘易斯•卡罗尔的韵律诗《海象和木匠》的音标转写，转写人的发音未必和你完全一样；正确的音标转写（语音转写）可以有很多种。,Following is a phonetic transcription of a verse in the poem “The Walrus and the Carpenter” by Lewis Carroll.The speaker who transcribed it may not have exactly the same pronunciation as you; there are many correct versions.
9416,转写的每一行音标中都有一个较大的错误，讲美国英语的人不可能这样发音。,"However, there is one major error in each line that is an impossible pronunciation for any American English speaker."
9416,这个错误也许是在单词中多写了或者少写了一个符号，或者符号写错了。,"The error may consist of an extra symbol, a missing symbol, or a wrong symbol in the word."
9416,转写使用的是窄式标音，送气与否、元音的鼻化都做了标注。,"Note that the phonetic transcription that is given is a narrow transcription; aspiration is marked, as is the nasalization of vowels."
9417,语用学讲的是语言意义在语境中的解释。,Pragmatics is concerned with our understanding of language in context.
9417,有两种互相关联的语境。,Two kinds of contexts are relevant.
9417,第一种是叙事语境——需要解释的短语或句子上文中的话语；第二种是情景语境—— 实际上包括说话者所处环境中所有非语言的东西。,The first is linguistic context—the discourse that precedes the phrase or sentence to be interpreted; the second is situational context—virtually everything nonlinguistic in the environment of the speaker.
9418,叙述通过它们提供的知识而进行控制。,"Through the knowledge they present, narratives police."
9418,按照西方的传统，小说表现强烈的愿望是怎样被驾驭的，以及如何使欲望适应社会实际。,Novels in the Western tradition show how aspirations are tamed and desires adjusted to social reality.
9418,许多小说都讲述青春的幻想是如何破灭的。,Many novels are the story of youthful illusions crushed.
9418,它们向我们讲述欲望、刺激欲望，为我们编排了激起男女相爱欲望的情节，而且从18世纪以来，小说越来越刻意暗示我们，如果我们还能实现真正的自我的话，那就只能在爰情、在私人关系中，而不能在公众行为中去实现。,"They tell us of desire, provoke desire, lay down for us the scenarios ofheterosexual desire, and, since the eighteenth century, they have increasingly worked to suggest that we achieve our true identity, if at all, in love, in personal relations, rather than in public action."
9418,然而，就在它们训练我们相信确实有“陷于热恋之中”这么一回事的同时，它们也把这个念头非神秘化了。,"But as they coach us to believe that there is such a thing as ‘being in love’, they also subject that idea to demystification."
9419,英语、德语、丹麦语、荷兰语、挪威语和瑞典语的基本词汇之间的相似性如此普遍，不可能出于偶然或是借用。,"The similarity of the basic vocabulary of languages such as English, German, Danish, Dutch, Norwegian, and Swedish is too pervasive for chance or borrowing."
9419,因此我们推断它们有共同的祖先——原始日耳曼语。,"We therefore conclude that these languages have a common parent, Proto-Germanic."
9419,原始日耳曼语没有文字记录，当然今天不可能还有以日耳曼语为本族语的人在世。,"There are no written records of Proto-Germanic, and certainly no native speakers alive today."
9419,原始日耳曼语是一种假设中的语言，它的特征都是根据它的后代语言推断出来的。,Proto-Germanic is a partially reconstructed language whose properties have been deduced based on its descendants.
9419,除了词汇相互关联之外，日耳曼族诸语言还有很多共同的语法属性，例如相似的不规则动词表，尤其是动词to be，这进一步佐证了它们之间的关系。,"In addition to related vocabulary, the Germanic languages share grammatical properties such as similar sets of irregular verbs, particularly the verb to be, and syntactic rules such as the verb (or auxiliary) movement rule discussed earlier in this chapter, further supporting their relatedness."
9420,其他语言的差别可能在于是否有圆唇元音。,Other languages may differ in whether or not they have rounded vowels.
9420,例如法语和瑞典语中有英语中没有的圆唇元音（确切说是圆唇前元音）。,"French and Swedish, for example, have front rounded vowels, which English lacks."
9420,英语中也没有后高不圆唇元音，但汉语普通话、日语以及喀麦隆的菲菲语等语言中都有。,"English also lacks a high back unrounded vowel, but this sound occurs in Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, and the Cameroonian language FeʔFeʔ, among others."
9420,这个元音的国际音标是[uu]。此处指明圆唇性很重要，因为我们注意到汉语普通话中不圆唇的[suu]是“四”，而圆唇的[suu](发音类似英语sue)是“速”。,"The IPA symbol for this vowel is [ш], and to show that roundedness is important, we note that in Mandarin Chinese the unrounded [sш] means “four,” but the round [su] (like sue) means “speed.”"
9421,但是，假如我们拒绝形式主义，而采用读者或者听众的观察角度，雅各布森模式的整个走向就改变了。,"However, if we reject formalism and adopt the perspective of the reader or audience, the whole orientation of Jakobson’s diagram changes."
9421,从这样一个新的视点，我们可以说，一首诗没有被阅读，就没有真正的存在；他的意义只有读者才能够讨论。,"From this angle, we can say that the poem has no real existence until it is read; its meaning can only be discussed by its readers."
9421,我们对一首诗之所有不同的理解，是因为我们阅读的方式不同。,We differ about interpretations only because our ways of reading differ.
9421,只有读者能够运用那写有信息的符码，从而激活那在阅读之前仅仅具有潜在意义的作品。,It is the reader who applies the code in which the message is written and in this way actualizes what would otherwise remain only potentially meaningful.
9422,儿童在很小的时候就会发现有些词是押韵的。,"From a very early age, children learn that certain words rhyme."
9422,"两个押韵的词，其最后一个音节的韵腹和韵尾都是相同的。正像下面顺口溜里的一样：Jack and Jill (杰克和吉尔)Wentupthehill (爬到山上)TofetchapAn introduction to languageofwater (去提一桶水)Jack fell down (杰克摔倒了)Andbrokehiscrown (摔破了王冠)And Jill came tumbling after (吉尔跌跌撞撞跟在后面)由于这个原因,韵腹和韵尾共同组成韵体这一低于音节的单位。","In rhyming words, the nucleus and the coda of the final syllable of both words are identical, as in the following jingle:Jack and JillWent up the hillTo fetch a pAn introduction to language of water.Jack fell downAnd broke his crownAnd Jill came tumbling after.For this reason, the nucleus + coda constitute the subsyllabic unit called a rime (note the spelling)."
9423,表述客体的，我们称之为技巧部分。因此我们对木头十字架和石十字架有着不同感觉这一说是技巧意见。,That which describes the object we shall call the technical part.Thus to say that we feel differently towards wooden crosses and stone crosses is a technical remark.
9423,韵律较之散体更适宜于温柔的恋情，据此看来，这一说法便为技巧意见。但在这里显然批评部分也可能轻易地流露出来。,"And to say that metre is more suited to the tender passion than is prose would be, as it stands, a technical remark, but here it is evident that a critical part might easily be also present."
9424,它强调自身是“媒介”，这媒介超越它所含有的“信息”，它特别关注自身，而且系统地强化自身的语言素质。,It emphasizes itself as a ‘medium’ over and above the ‘message’ it contains: it characteristically draws attention to itself and systematically intensiﬁes its own linguistic qualities.
9424,所以，语词在诗歌中具有的地位不只是作为表达思想的工具，而是实实在在的客体，是自主的、具体的实体。,"As a result, words in poetry have the status not simply of vehicles for thoughts, but of objects in their own right, autonomous concrete entities."
9424,用索绪尔的话来说，它们不再是“能指”而成为“所指”， 正是诗歌的“陌生化”的技法诸如节奏、韵律、格律等，才使这种结构变化得以实现。,"In Saussure’s terms, then, they cease to be ‘signiﬁers’ and become ‘signiﬁeds’, and it is the poem’s alienating devices of rhythm, rhyme, metre, etc. which enable this structural change to be achieved."
9424,正如雅各布森所说的那样（我们后面会看到，他自己的语言理论对这段话是一个有力的支持）。,"As Roman Jakobson puts it, in a statement for which, we shall see later, there is considerable support in his own linguistic theory."
9425,人们常常会发现拼写检查程序被用作信息提取系统的前端程序，用来核对关键词，以防止因拼写错误而误导搜寻。,"One often finds spell checkers as front ends to information retrieval systems, checking the keywords to prevent misspellings from misleading the search.Most e-mAn introduction to language systems also do spell checking, though that feature may be undesirable when texting because of so many nonstandard usages."
9425,"然而，拼写检查程序并不能替代仔细认真的编辑工作，正如下面的诗歌所示：                                         I have a spelling checker.It came with my PC.It plane lee marks four my revueMiss steaks aye can knot sea.A checker is a bless sing,It freeze yew lodes of thyme.It helps me right awl stiles to reed,And aides me when aye rime.To rite with care is quite a feet                                      Of witch won should bee proud,And wee mussed dew the best wee can,Sew flaws are knot aloud.我有拼写检查程序。它和电脑一起来到。它只是标示出来给我看 我不能看见的错误。","Moreover, as the following poem reveals, spell checkers cannot replace careful editing:I have a spelling checker.It came with my PC.It plane lee marks four my revueMiss steaks aye can knot sea.A checker is a bless sing,It freeze yew lodes of thyme.It helps me right awl stiles to reed,And aides me when aye rime.To rite with care is quite a feet                      Of witch won should bee proud,And wee mussed dew the best wee can,Sew flaws are knot aloud."
9425,拼写检查程序是个福音，它给你省了很多时间。,
9425,它帮助我写作各种文体，还帮我写诗押韵。,
9425,仔细写作是件了不起的事 任何人都该为此自豪，我们必须尽力而为，所以不允许有任何瑕疵。,
9426,两个押韵的词，其最后一个音节的韵腹和韵尾都是相同的。正像下面顺口溜里的一样：Jack and Jill（杰克和吉尔）Went up the hill（爬到山上）To fetch a pail of water.（去提一桶水）Jack fell down（杰克摔倒了）And broke his crown（摔破了王冠）And Jill came tumbling after.,"In rhyming words, the nucleus and the coda of the final syllable of both words are identical, as in the following jingle: Jack and JillWent up the hillTo fetch a pail of water.Jack fell downAnd broke his crownAnd Jill came tumbling after.For this reason, the nucleus + coda constitute the subsyllabic unit called a rime (note the spelling)."
9426,（吉尔跌跌撞撞地跟在后面）。,
9426,由于这个原因，韵腹和韵尾共同组成韵体这一低于音节的单位。,
9427,韦尼克区受损的病人，则可能患上韦尼克失语症，患者说流利但语义异常的话语。更严重的是杂乱性失语症，患者说无意义的语言形式，因此无从理解。,"Damage to Wernicke’s area may result in Wernicke’s aphasia, in which fluent speakers produce semantically anomalous utterances, or even worse, jargon aphasia, in which speakers produce nonsense forms that make their utterance uninterpretable."
9427,对其他部位的损伤可能引起命名不能症，是一种患者有找词困难的失语症。,"Damage to yet different areas can produce anomia, a form of aphasia in which the patient has word-finding difficulties."
9428,小孩子学英语的时候最先学习正常规则，他们会把这种规则用到所有的词形上去。,"When children are learning English, they first learn the regular rules, which they apply to all forms."
9428,因此，我们经常听到他们说mans和goed。,"Thus, we often hear them say mans and goed."
9428,在后来习得语言的过程中，他们具体地学习不规则的复数变化，比如men(男人们）和mice (老鼠，复数），以及不规则的过去时形式，比如came (come的过去式）和went(go的过去式）。,"Later in the acquisition process, they specifically learn irregular plurals like men and mice, and irregular past tense forms like came and went."
9428,孩子们犯的这些错误，实际上证明了一般规则是存在的。,These children’s errors are actually evidence that the regular rules exist.
9429,除了对布罗卡区和韦尼克区受损病人的研究外，对正常人以及其他脑区域受损病人的研究，都为“脑的结构性和分化性”提供了引人注目的证据。,Dramatic evidence for a differentiated and structured brain is also provided by studies of both normal individuals and patients with lesions in regions of the brain other than Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas.
9429,有的病人说人名有困难，有的说动物的名称有 困难，还有的很难说出工具的名称。,Some patients have difficulty speaking a person’s name; others have problems naming animals; and still oth ers cannot name tools.
9429,fMRI研究揭示了每组病人脑受损处的部位及其形状。,fMRI studies have revealed the shape and location of the brain lesions in each of these types of patients.
9429,每组病人在左颞叶不同的、不相重叠的部位都有损伤。,"The patients in each group had brain lesions in distinct, nonoverlapping regions of the left temporal lobe."
9429,在后续的PET扫描研究中，要求正常的受试者说出人、动物或工具的名称。,"In a follow-up PET scan study, normal subjects were asked to name persons, animals, or tools."
9429,,"Experimenters found that there was differential activation in the normal brains in just those sites that were damaged in the aphasics who were unable to name persons, animals, or tools."
9430,它已取得一些有希望的初步结果，并为未来的研究提出了一个将会具有重大意义的可能方向。,"It has some promising initial results, and it suggests one possible direction for future research that might prove to be of great importance."
9430,这样，目前来看，数理语言学在社会科学和心理科学中的数学研究方法中，将占有一个特别有利的位置，以发展不只是作为数据的理论，而是作为决定人类心理过程特性的高度抽象的原理和结构的理论。,"Thus, mathematical linguistics seems for the moment to be in a uniquely favorable position, among mathematical approaches in the social and psychological sciences, to develop not simply as a theory of data, but as the study of highly abstract principles and structures that determine the character of human mental processes."
9430,在这个情形下，所考察的心理过程就是那些包栝在人类知识的一个特殊领域——即语言知识——的组织中的心理过程。,"In this case, the mental processes in question are those involved in the organization of one specific domain of human knowledge, namely knowledge of language."
9431,短语结构树同样还表现了一个句子中不同组成部分之间的关系，例如，句子的主语和直接宾语可以从结构上进行定义。,"Phrase structure trees also show relationships among elements in a sentence.For example, the subject and direct object of the sentence can be structurally defined."
9431,主语是离树根S最近的，或者说由S直接统制的NP。直接宾语就是离VP最近的，或者说由VP直接统制的NP。,"The subject is the NP that is closest to, or immediately dominated by, the root S. The direct object is the NP that is closest to, or immediately dominated by, VP."
9432,这些例子说明的是人称直指。,These examples illustrate person deixis.
9432,它们还表明，像this和that这样的指示冠词也是直指的。,They also show that the demonstrative articles like this and that are deictic.
9432,此外，还有时间直指和地点直指。,We also have time deixis and place deixis.
9433,“真”的科学意义，即指称和象征着指称的派生性的表述是真实的，这是不必多谈的。,"The scientific sense that, namely, in which references, andderivatively statements symbolizing references, are true, need not delay us."
9433,当一个指称所指的事物客观上汇合起来的方式如同指称所指的时候，这个指称便是真的。,A reference is true when the things to which it refers are actually together in the way in which it refers to them.
9433,否则它便是假的。,Otherwise it is false.
9434,他争论说，布林格拉特和多利莫尔没有能够看出伊丽莎白时代平民文化的有效性与力量。,He argued that Greenblatt and Dollimore fail to recognize the vitality and power of popular culture in the Elizabethan period.
9434,巴赫金把“狂欢节”看作与官方文化对立的“第二种文化”，这种文化在整个中世纪与现代早期为平民大众所推行。,"Bakhtin regards ‘Carnival’ as a ‘second culture’, which was opposed to the official culture, and which was carried on by the common people throughout the Middle Ages and well into the early modern period."
9434,巴赫金认为，狂欢节在官方结构中插入一种“不确定性，语义的开放性”，这个论点可以为说明主体在整个“反身份认同”甚或“解身份认同”模式中怎样回应主流话语提供一条路径。,"Bakhtin’s idea that Carnival inserts into official structures ‘an indeterminacy, a certain semantic openendedness’ could well provide one way of describing how subjects might respond to dominant discourses through the modalities of ‘counter-identification’ or even ‘disidentification’."
9435,如果主体是一个“有意识”的主体，那么当你无意识地选择，或者做了一件事而没有料到它的后果时，你可以声明无辜，拒绝承担责任。,"If the subject means ‘the conscious subject’, then you can claim innocence, deny responsibility, if you haven’t consciously chosen or intended the consequences of an act you have committed."
9435,相反，如果主体的概念包括了无意识的主体和你占据的主体位置，那么责任就可以被扩大。,"If, on the contrary, your conception of the subject includes the unconscious and the subject positions you occupy, responsibility can be expanded."
9435,强调无意识的结构 或非你所选的主体位置是要求你对你生活中的事件和生活的结构负责任——比如种族主义的和性歧视的结构——尽管这种结构并不是你的意图。,Emphasis on the structures of the unconscious or subject positions you do not choose calls you to responsibility for events and structures in your life – of racism and sexism for instance – that you did not explicitly intend.
9435,拓宽的主体槪念与从主体的传统程式中形成的对能动作用和责任的限制相对立。,The expanded notion of the subject combats the restriction of agency and responsibility derived from traditional conceptions of the subject.
9436,迈克尔所用的替代在习得早期所使用的音系规则中很典型。,Michael’s substitutions are typical of the phonological rules that operate in the very early stages of acquisition.
9436,"其他常见的规则还有重叠和词尾辅音脱落，前者如将bottle (瓶子）发成[baba]，water ( 水）发成 [wawa]; 后者如将bed 发成 [be], cake发成 [ke]。","Other common rules are reduplication—“bottle” becomes [baba], “water” becomes [wawa]; and the dropping of a final consonants—“bed” becomes [be], “cake” becomes [ke]."
9436,这两个规则说明儿童喜欢简单的 CV 音 节 。,These two rules show that the child prefers a simple CV syllable.
9437,在不需要用助动词来构造问句的语言中，儿童造出的问句与成人的更为类似。,"In languages that do not require auxiliaries to form a question, children appear more adultlike."
9437,比如，在荷兰语和意大利语的问句是主动词移位。,"For example, in Dutch and Italian, the main verb moves."
9437,由于许多主动词都要求放在助动词之前，所以当处在电报式言语阶段时，学说荷兰语和意大利语的儿童说出来的问句符合成人的语法规则。,"Because many main verbs are acquired before auxiliaries, Dutch and Italian children in the telegraphic stage produce questions that follow the adult rule."
9438,诺瓦利斯在他那篇晦涩难解的《批评论稿》中写道：“音乐、造型艺术和诗歌是一组同义词。,"‘Music, plastic art, and poetry are synonyms,’ wrote Novali in his cryptic Fragments."
9438,因此，绘画和造型艺术只是音乐的外形。”“绘画、造型艺术--客观的音乐。音乐--主观的音乐或绘画。”,"‘Painting, plastic art are therefore nothing but figurations [Figuristik] of music.’ ‘Painting, plastic art—objective music.，Music—subjective music or painting.’"
9439,“主观批评”建立在这样的假设上：“每一个人”最紧急的动机是理解他自身。,‘Subjective criticism’ is based on the assumption that ‘each person’s most urgent motivations are to understand himself’.
9439,在课堂实验中，布莱奇被引导去区别：（1）读者对一个文本自发的“反应”和（2）读者加给这个文本的“意义”。,"In his classroom experiments, Bleich was led to distinguish between (1) the reader’s spontaneous ‘response’ to a text and (2) the ‘meaning’ the reader attributed to it."
9439,这个“意义”通常被陈述为一种“客观的”解释（在教育的形势中 提供来磋商的那些内容），但却必然是从读者的“主观反应”发展出来的。,"The latter is usually presented as an ‘objective’ interpretation (something offered for negotiation in a pedagogic situation), but is necessarily developed from the subjective response of the reader."
9440,这样来看待语言与人的主观性之间的关系就是同意结构主义关于避免所谓“人道主义”谬误的看法。这一谬误是一种天真的意见，认为文学作品只是对我们说话的真实男女的活声音的一种抄录。,To see the relation between language and human subjectivity in this way is to concur with the structuralists in avoiding what may be called the 'humanist' fallacy — the naive notion that a literary text is just a kind of transcript of the living voice of a real man or woman addressing us.
9440,这样的文学观点往往总是发现，文学的显著特征一一即它是被写成的这一事实——有点恼人：冷冰冰的非人性的印刷物把粗笨的身躯插在我们与作者之间。,"Such a view of literature always tends to find its distinguishing characteristic — the fact that it is written — somehow disturbing: the print, in all its cold impersonality, interposes its ungainly bulk between ourselves and the author."
9441,VP可以有的另一种结构就是包含或者嵌套一个句子。,Another option open to the VP is to contain or embed a sentence.
9441,例如，句子“The professor said that the students passed the exam(教授说学生通过了考试）”，包含句子“the student passed the exam(学生通过了考试）”。,"For example, the sentence “The professor said that the student passed the exam” contains the sentence “the student passed the exam.”"
9441,在这个嵌套句之前是词that，这是一个标补语（C)。,"Preceding the embedded sentence is the word that, which is a complementizer (C)."
9441,和Aux、Det—样，C属于功能范畴。,"C is a functional category, like Aux and Det."
9442,语言机能具有模块性。,The language faculty is modular.
9442,它独立于与之相互作用的其他认知系统。,It is independent of other cognitive systems with which it interacts.
9442,在失语症、患有专门性语言障碍（SThe language instinct : how the mind creates language) 的儿童、白痴天才，以及关键期过后才开始学习语言的儿童等诸项研究中，都发现了模块性的证据。,"Evidence for modularity is found in studies of aphasia, of children with specific language impairment (SThe language instinct : how the mind creates language), of linguistic savants, and of children who learn language past the critical period."
9443,我们已经确定，一个专有名词（比如说 “杰克”）的意义，就是它所指的一个个体，或者说它的指称。,"We have already determined that the meaning of proper names like Jack is its reference, that link between the word Jack and the person named Jack, which is its referent."
9443,专有名词是名词短语（NP)，你可以在一个句子中任何一个NP的位置换上专有名词，句子仍然合乎语法。,Proper names are noun phrases (NPs); you can substitute a proper name in any NP position in a sentence and preserve grammaticality.
9443,还有其他NP也指称个体。,There are other NPs that refer to individuals as well.
9444,近年来，结构主义者对转化语法表示出越来越浓厚的兴趣的原因之一是他们觉得它比较“充满活力”。,One factor that has tempted structuralists in recent years to shift their allegiance to transformational grammar is the notion that it is more 'dynamic'.
9444,结构主义语言学是分析性的，它把语序简化为各个构造成分，而乔姆斯基的模式则被认为是综合性的，再现了说话者实际发出的言语（新的和旧的）：“从理论基础来看，生成语法较分析语言的方法有其优点，它能引出一种综合的观点，这种观点把说话行为看作是一个生成过程。”,"Whereas structural linguistics was analytic and reduced a given sequence to its constituents, Chomsky's model is thought to be synthetic and to represent the actual production of utterances (new and old) by a speaker: 'generative grammar has, in its theoretical foundations, the advantage over analytic approaches to language, of introducing a synthetic point of view which presents the act of speech as a generative process'."
9445,最后，结构是自我调节的，这就是说，为了有效地进行转换程序，它不向自身以外求援。,"Finally, the structure is self-regulating in the sense that it makes no appeals beyond itself in order to validate its transformational procedures."
9445,各种转换旨在维护和赞同使它们得以产生的那些内在规律，并且把本系统“封闭”起来，不使它和其他系统接触。,"The transformations act to maintain and underwrite the intrinsic laws which bring them about, and to ‘seal off’ the system from reference to other systems."
9445,我们还是举原先的例子，语言并不是通过参照“现实”的模式来构词的，而是根据自己内部的、自足的规则来构词的。,"A language, to take the previous example, does not construct its formations of words by reference to the patterns of ‘reality’, but on the basis of its own internal and self-sufficient rules."
9446,因此，在隐喻“汽车甲壳虫般地行驶”中，甲壳虫的运动和汽车的运动“等值”，而在转喻性的短语“白宫在考虑一项新政策”中，特定的建筑和美国总统“等值”。,"Thus, in the metaphor ‘the car beetled along’, the movement of a beetle is proposed as ‘equivalent’ to that of the car, and in the metonymic phrase ‘The White House considers a new policy’, a specific building is proposed as ‘equivalent’ to the president of the United States."
9446,广义地说，隐喻是以人们在实实在在的主体〈汽车的运动）和它的比喻式的代用词（甲壳虫的运动）之间提出的相似性或类比为基础的。而转喻则以人们在实实在在的主体（总统）和它“邻近的”代用词（总统生活的地方）之间进行的接近的（或“相继的”）联想为基础。,"Broadly speaking, metaphor is based on a proposed similarity or analogy between the literal subject (the car’s movement) and its metaphorical substitute (the beetle’s movement), whereas metonymy is based on a proposed contiguous (or ‘sequential’) association between the literal subject (the president) and its ‘adjacent’ replacement (where the president lives)."
9447,我对如此定义“资源丰富的经验主义“这个概念似乎并不感兴趣。,The concept “resourceful empiricism” so defined seems to me of little interest.
9447,"我关心的是，是否有”多种观念和原则，它们能够决定所习得的那些有限却有序的知识以何种形式存在“，或者是否”习得机制的结构受限于某种初级的周边处理机制……以及某种分析数据处理机制或归纳原则“。(Aspects, 第47页)","The issue that concerns me is whether there are “ideas and principles of various kinds that determine the form of the acquired knowledge in what may be a rather restricted and highly organized way,” or alternatively, whether “the structure of the acquisition device is limited to certain elementary peripheral processing mechanisms . . . and certain analytical data-processing mechanisms or inductive principles” (Aspects, pp. 47 f)."
9448,它意含着人之所以知道如何使用语言，就好像蜘蛛知道如何结网—样。,It conveys the idea that people know how to talk in more or less the sense that spiders know how to spin webs.
9448,蜘蛛的结网并不是哪个天才蜘蛛发明的，也跟它所受的教育无关，或跟它的建筑师的倾向或建筑的行业没有任何关联。,Web-spinning was not invented by some unsung spider genius and does not depend on having had the right education or on having an aptitude for architecture or the construction trades.
9448,蜘蛛会结网是因为蜘蛛有个脑袋，它的脑给予它结网的冲动与完成的能力。,"Rather, spiders spin spider webs because they have spider brains, which give them the urge to spin and the competence to succeed."
9448,虽然网和字是有差别的，我还是希望你能从这个角度去看语言，因为只有这样，我们下面所讲的现象才有意义。,"Although there are differences between webs and words, I will encourage you to see language in this way, for it helps to make sense of the phenomena we will explore."
9449,人们常常以不同的方式对词进行缩减省略，使词所传达的信息长度变短。,Speakers tend to abbreviate words in various ways to shorten the messages they convey.
9449,,We used to find this in telegrams and telexes.
9449,以戏剧性的方式让我们理解这一点的，是人们在手机上打字发短信或使用其他类似通信技术时所表现的创造性。,Now it is seen dramatically in the creativity used on messages typed into cell phones in text messaging and similar communication technologies.
9449,不过，我们要关注的是pif，并且观察三种缩减现象：截短词、缩略词和字母缩写词。,"However, we will concern ourselves with spoken language and observe three reduction phenomena: clipping, acronyms, and alphabetic abbreviations."
9450,"他们说话很慢,一个字、一个字地说，很仔细地计划他们下一个字要说什么，而鼓励別人替他把句子说完。","They speak somewhat slowly and deliberately, carefully planning what they will say and encouraging their interlocutors to come to their aid by completing sentences for them."
9450,他们表示：普通的谈话对他们来说是件耗费心力的巨大工程，他们除非必要，都尽量避免开口说话。,They report that ordinary conversation is strenuous mental work and that when possible they avoid situations in which they must speak.
9450,他们的语句中充满文法上的错误，例如用错代词，用错复数和过去式的字尾变化。,"Their speech contains frequent grammatical errors, such as misuse of pronouns and of suffixes like the plural and past tense."
9451,在许多实质性的方面，今日的学术气氛与17世纪西欧的学术气氛相似。,There are many far from superficial respects in which the intellectual climate of today resembles that of seventeenth-century Western Europe.
9451,对我们眼下的话题来说尤为重要的是对自动机的潜力和能力的巨大兴趣。这个问题像吸引我们一样深深地吸引着17世纪的人们。,"One, particularly crucial in the present context, is the very great interest in the potentialities and capacities of automata, a problem that intrigued the seventeenth-century mind as fully as it does our own."
9452,这个也是说明自然类别的东西的推理方式与人造品的推理方式是不同的。,And this in turn makes reasoning about natural kinds different from reasoning about artifacts.
9452,人们可以推论说假如鳟鱼是一种鱼，而鱼是一种动物，那么鳟鱼就是一种动物。,"People can deduce that if a trout is a kind of fish and a fish is a kind of animal, then a trout is a kind of animal."
9452,但是他们不会这样推论说：车子的座椅是一种椅子，而椅子是一种家具，所以车子的座椅是一种家具。,"But they do not infer that if a car seat is a kind of chair and a chair is a kind of furniture, then a car seat is a kind of furniture."
9453,单纯的经验主义是不够的，单纯的自然主义则导致误解。,Mere empiricism is not enough.Mere ‘naturalism’ is misleading.
9453,事实上，人类学家所关心的是社会生活（和语言）建之其上的“无意识的基础”。,"In fact, the anthropologist’s concern lies with the ‘unconscious foundations’on which that social life – and that language – rest."
9453,简言之，他研究的是整个文化的语言；它的体系和它的一般规律：他通过言语的形形色色的变化来探究文化的语言。,"His quarry, in short, is the langue of the whole culture; its system and its general laws: he stalks it through the particular varieties of its parole."
9454,不过，我们再次发现这一点同样适用于其他形式。比如贴在汽车保险杠上的小招贴广告。同诗篇一样，它要表达的意思也可以是建立在先前的这类小招贴画上的。比如，“为了耶稣不要用核武器屠杀鲸鱼！,"But once again, we find that this is something we could say about other forms: bumper stickers, like poems, may depend for their meaning on prior bumper stickers: ‘Nuke a Whale for Jesus!’ makes no sense without ‘No Nukes,’ ‘Save the Whales,’ and ‘Jesus Saves,’ and one could certainly say that ‘Nuke a Whale for Jesus’ is really about bumper stickers."
9454,”（Nuke a Whale for Jesus!,
9454,）如果没有“禁止核武器!,
9454,” “救救鲸鱼！,
9454,”和“耶稣拯救万物！,
9454,”这些小招贴，那句话就没有任何意义了。,
9454,所以我们可以肯定地说“为了耶稣不要用核武器屠杀鲸鱼！,
9454,"”是关于小招贴广吿的招貼广吿。最后, 文学的交织性和它的自我折射性并不是一个界定特点，而是突出运用语言的某些方面和语言再现的某些问題，在其他地方可能也会观察到同样的现象。","The intertextuality and self-reflexivity of literature is not, finally, a defining feature but a foregrounding of aspects of language use and questions about representation that may also be observed elsewhere."
9455,自上而下过程从处理语义和句法信息开始，然后再处理来自感官输入的词汇信息。,"Bottom-up processing moves step-by-step from the incoming acoustic (or visual) signal, to phonemes, morphemes, words and phrases, and ultimately to semantic interpretation."
9455,通过利用更高层级的信息，我们就能预测接下来的言语信号内容。意义构建的每一步均以感官数据及相伴的词汇信息为基础。,Each step of building toward a meaning is based on the sensory data and accompanying lexical information.
9455,根据这一模式，说话人直到听见the和boy，才会开始构建名词短语，继而等待听到下一个词等等。,"According to this model the speaker waits until hearing ""the"" and ""boy"" before constructing an NP, and then waits for the next word, and so on."
9456,而且，宗教可以在每一个社会层面上发挥作用：如果它有适于少数精英的理论版，它也有适于广大群众的虔诚牌。,"Religion, moreover, is capable of operating at every social level: if there is a doctrinal inflection of it for the intellectual elite, there is also a pietistic brand of it for the masses."
9456,它提供一种极好的社会“粘合剖”，从而把虔诚的农民、理智的中层阶级自由主义者和神学知识分子纳入单一的组织之中。,"It provides an excellent social 'cement', encompassing pious peasant, enlightened middle-class liberal and theological intellectual in a single organization."
9456,它的意识形态力量在于它能够把信仰“物质化”为实践行为：宗教是分享圣杯和感谢收获，而不仅仅是关于圣体合质或最高圣母崇拜的抽象论辩。,"Its ideological power lies in its capacity to 'materialize' beliefs as practices: religion is the sharing of the chalice and the blessing of the harvest, not just abstract argument about consubstantiation or hyperdulia."
9456,它的终极真理像文学象征所传达的那些真理一样，方便地拒绝了理性的证明：因此，这些真理的权利是绝对的。,"Its ultimate truths, like those mediated by the literary symbol, are conveniently closed to rational demonstration, and thus absolute in their claims."
9457,阻音以外的音素是有共振的响音。,Sounds that are not obstruents are sonorants.
9457,发响音时空气较为自由地从口腔或鼻腔流出。,"Vowels, nasal stops [m,n,ŋ], liquids [l,r], and glides [j,w] are all sonorants."
9457,它们的声学能量比阻音大，大部分能量都消耗在推动空气通过较窄的声道。,"They are produced with much less obstruction to the flow of air than the obstruents, which permits the air to resonate."
9458,那些有着不同语素变体的最小对比对对我们的研究尤其有用。,Minimal pairs whose members take different allomorphs are particularly useful for our search.
9458,"例如，考虑cab [kæb] 和cap[kæp],其复数形式的语素变体分别为z和s。","For example, consider cab [kæb] and cap [kæp], which respectively take the allomorphs [z] and [s] to form the plural."
9458,很明显，两者只有最后一个音段不同，因此最后一个音段才是导致不同语素变体的原因。,
9459,掌握一种语言，即是掌握该语言里的语素、单纯词、复合词以及它们的意义。,Here is where the usual semantic rules for combining meanings do not apply.
9459,此外，还要掌握该语言里的固定短语。,
9459,固定短语由一个以上的词组成，其意义不能从单个词的意义中推知。有些词语表现很像单个语素—— 不可分解，有着固定的、必须记住的意义，在它们那里组构性原则不起作用。用来组合意义的通常的语义规则在这里并不适用。,"The principle of compositionality is superseded by expressions that act very much like individual morphemes in that they are not decomposable, but have a fixed meaning that must be learned."
9460,对A-over-A原理的这种扩充和修正，带来了一些严重的、难以解决的问题。,There remain a number of very serious problems that seem to resist solution by such extensions and modifications of the A-over-A principle.
9460,请注意，该原理的提出尚未得到迄今已有的例子的充分支持。,Notice that this principle is formulated in a way that is not really well supported by the examples so far given.
9460,如果A-over-A原理大体上是正确的，那么，我们就会找到这样的例子：对A类各种各样的短语來说，我们不能杷A类短语从另一个更大一些的A类短语中抽走。,"If the A-over-A principle were true in general, we would expect to find cases in which a phrase of category A cannot be extracted from a larger phrase of category A, for various choices of A."
9461,语言机能具有模块性。,The language faculty is modular.
9461,它独立于与之相互作用的其他认知系统。,It is independent of other cognitive systems with which it interacts.
9461,在 失语症、患有专门性语言障碍（SThe language instinct : how the mind creates language)的儿童、白痴天才，以及关键期过后才开始学习语言的儿童等诸项研究中，都发现了模块性的证据。患有SThe language instinct : how the mind creates language儿童虽然患有语言缺陷，但其他方面正常。语言白痴天才具有超常的语言能力，但在一般智能方面却存在缺陷。,"Evidence for modularity is found in studies of aphasia, of children with specific language impairment (SThe language instinct : how the mind creates language), of linguistic savants, and of children who learn language past the critical period."
9461,他们的存在表明，语言能力并非源自某种一般的认知能力，而是独立存在的。,The genetic basis for an independent language module is supported by studies of SThe language instinct : how the mind creates language in families and twins and by studies of genetic anomalies associated with language disorders.
9462,“目的论”，即从tolos或目的的角度思考生命、语言和历史，是在意义等级体系中整理和排列意义的一种方法，它依据终极目的在意义中创造一种尊卑贵贱秩序。,"Teleology', thinking of life, language and history in terms of its orientation to a telos or end, is a way of ordering and ranking meanings in a hierarchy of significance, creating a pecking order among them in the light of an ultimate purpose."
9462,但是，任何这样一种认为历史或语言只是简单的直线发展的理论都忽略了我一直在描述的符号的网状复杂性，即实际语言过程中或前或后，或左或右，或隐或现的符号运动。,"But any such theory of history or language as a simple linear evolution misses the web-like complexity of signs which I have been describing, the back and forth, present and absent, forward and sideways movement of language in its actual processes."
9462,后结构主义用“本文”一词所表示的，正是这种网状复杂性。,"It is that web-like complexity, indeed, which post-structuralism designates by the word 'text'."
9463,发响音时空气较为自由地从口腔或鼻腔流出。,"Vowels, nasal stops [m,n,ŋ], liquids [l,r], and glides [j,w] are all sonorants."
9463,它们的声学能量比阻音大，大部分能量都消耗在推动空气通过较窄的声道。,"They are produced with much less obstruction to the flow of air than the obstruents, which permits the air to resonate."
9463,鼻塞音是响音，尽管气流在口腔中受到阻断，但在鼻腔中持续地造成共振。,"Nasal stops are sonorants because, although the air is blocked in the mouth, it continues to resonate in the nasal cavity."
9463,"元音、流音[1]和[r]，滑音[j]和[w],也是响音，因为空气在通过声道时较少阻碍而有共振。",
9464,现在我们可以用带声性、鼻音性、调音部位和调音方式来区别英语中所有的辅音。,"We are now capable of distinguishing all of the consonant sounds of English via the properties of voicing, nasality, and place and manner of articulation."
9464,例如，[f]是唇齿清（口）擦音；[n]是龈（带）鼻塞音。,"For example, [f] is a voiceless, (oral), labiodental fricative; [n] is a (voiced), nasal, alveolar stop."
9464,括号中的特征一般由于有冗余性就不说了。除非特指出是鼻音之外，其他所有音都是口音；英语中所有鼻音都是带声的。,"The parenthesized features are usually not mentioned because they are redundant; all sounds are oral unless nasal is specifically mentioned, and all nasals are voiced in English."
9465,从这个每度看，并不是非比喻的和比喻的手法之间没有区别，而是比喻用语和象征都是语言的基本结构，不是例外，也不是歪曲。,"From this perspective, it’s not that there is no distinction between literal and figurative but rather that tropes and figures are fundamental structures of language, not exceptions and distortions."
9465,从传统上说，比喻一直是最重要的修辞手段。,"Traditionally, the most important figure has been metaphor."
9465,比喻把一种事物比作另一种事物（如称乔治是头驴，或者把我的爱比作红红的玫瑰)。,"A metaphor treats something as something else (calling George a donkey or my love a red,red rose)."
9466,这里有一些表情符。,Here are several emoticons.
9466,看看你能不能给每个符号都赋予意义。,See if you can assign a meaning to each one.
9466,这里并没有唯一正确的答案，因为它们在语言中出现的时间太短，还来不及约定俗成。,There is no one correct answer because they haven’t been in the language long enough to become conventionalized.
9467,与语言学的情况一样，获取关于能力的信息并没有一种自动的程序，而需要说明的事实却并不匮乏。,"As in linguistics, there is no automatic procedure for obtaining information about competence, but there is no dearth of facts to be explained."
9467,逐一考察读者的阅读行为并不能说明问题，因为人们的兴趣不在于表现本身，而在于位于行为背后的心照不宣的理解或能力。,"To take surveys of the behaviour of readers would serve little purpose, since one is interested not in performance itself but in the tacit knowledge or competence which underlies it."
9467,阅读表现很可能并不是能力的直接反应，因为人的行为可能受到诸多无关因素的影响：我或许在某一时刻走神，或许沉湎于个人联想而出岔，或许遗忘了上文的某一重要情节，或许无意识中理解错了，如若指出，我会恍然大悟的。,"Performance may not be a direct reflection of competence, for behaviour can be influenced by a host of irrelevant factors: I may not have been paying attention at a given moment, may have been led astray by purely personal associations, may have forgotten something important from an earlier part of the text, may have made what I would recognize as a mistake if it were pointed out to me."
9468,图画文字和表意文字的区别并不总是一清二楚的。,The difference between pictograms and ideograms is not always clear.
9468,表意文字倾向于不太直接地代表所指事物，我们必须通过学习才能明白某个特定表意文字的意义。,"Ideograms tend to be less direct representations, and one may have to learn what a particular ideogram means."
9468,而图画文字则更为直观。,Pictograms tend to be more literal.
9469,你同样可以为其他类型的并列结构（例如VP或PP的并列结构）构建结构树，它们遵循同样的模式。,"You can also construct trees for other kinds of coordinate structures, such as VP or PP coordination, which follow the same pattern."
9469,Michael writes poetry and surfs.（迈克尔既写诗也冲浪。VP和VP）,Michael writes poetry and surfs.(VP and VP)
9469,Sam rode his bicycle to school and to the pool.（山姆上学和去游泳池都骑自行车。,Sam rode his bicycle to school and to the pool.
9469,PP和PP）,(PP and PP)
9470,严重的韦尼克失语症常常被称为杂乱性失语症。,Severe Wernicke’s aphasia is often referred to as jargon aphasia.
9470,布罗卡失语症患者和韦尼克失语症患者表现出来的语言缺陷，都指向人脑中语言的模块性组织。,The linguistic deficits exhibited by people with Broca’s and Wernicke’s aphasia point to a modular organization of language in the brain.
9470,我们发现不同脑部位的损伤造成的语言障碍类型是不同的（比如，是句法还是语义）。,"We find that damage to different parts of the brain results in different kinds of linguistic impairment (e.g., syntactic versus semantic)."
9471,带有句法范畴信息的树形图被称为短语结构树或是成分结构树。,A tree diagram with syntactic category information is called a phrase structure tree or a constituent structure tree.
9471,这棵树表明这个句子既是线性的一串词，又是短语套短语的层级结构。,This tree shows that a sentence is both a linear string of words and a hierarchical structure with phrases nested in phrases.
9471,短语结构树（简称为PS树）清楚地用图形表征了说话者关于他所使用的语言中句子结构的知识。,"Phrase structure trees (PS trees, for short) are explicit graphic representations of a speaker’s knowledge of the structure of the sentences of his language."
9472,像德·曼一样，他认为批评是内在于文学的，而不是处在文学之外。,"Like de Man, he regards criticism as inside rather than outside literature."
9472,他以此为凭证，以为自己似乎折中地使用别的文本(文学的、哲学的、通俗的)来支撑自己的话语是理所当然的。,"He has used this licence to justify his seemingly eclectic use of other texts (literary, philosophical, popular) to underpin his own discourse."
9472,例如，他曾说基督的教喻是粗糙生硬的、怪异陌生的，被“古老的阐释学”捋顺了，古老的阐释学“就如同邓恩的‘能使一切变质的蜘蛛之爱’一样具有掺和调和倾向”。,"For example, at one point he writes about the harshness and strangeness of Christ’s parables, which were smoothed over by the ‘older hermeneutics’ which ‘tended to be incorporative or reconciling, like Donne’s “spider love that transubstantiates all”’."
9473,第三个成分测试是“作为一个单位移动”的测试。,A third test of constituency is the “move as a unit” test.
9473,如果一组词可以移动，那么它们就是一个成分。,"If a group of words can be moved, they form a constituent."
9473,例如，如果我们把以下句子同the child found a puppy（孩子找到了一条小狗）比较，我们可以发现某一部分发生了移动：It was a puppy that the child found.,"For example, if we compare the follow- ing sentences to the sentence “The child found a puppy,” we see that certain elements have moved: It was a puppy that the child found."
9474,人类的语音按照语音属性分类。,Human speech sounds fall into classes according to their phonetic properties.
9474,所有的音素不是辅音，就是元音。而所有辅音不是阻音就是响音。,"All speech sounds are either consonants or vowels, and all consonants are either obstruents or sonorants."
9474,辅音在声道中有某种阻碍，阻碍处就定义了它们的调音部位，其中有双唇、唇齿、龈、腭、软腭、小舌、喉门。,"Consonants have some obstruction of the airstream in the vocal tract, and the location of the obstruction defines their place of articulation, some of which are bilabial, labiodental, alveolar, palatal, velar, uvular, and glottal."
9475,"迈克尔系统性地用龈塞音M替代软腭塞音[k]，如在他的cow，clean, kiss等词和他自己的名字 中。","Michael systematically substituted the alveolar stop [t] for the velar stop [k] as in his words for “cow,” “clean,” “kiss,” and his own name."
9475,当[t]出现在词中时，他用唇音[p]来代替，如在他的词Papi和 diaper中 。,"He also replaced labial [p] with [t] when it occurred in the middle of a word, as in his words for “Papi” and “diaper.”"
9475,"他 删 减 spoon, plane 和 stroller等词中的辅音丛，还创造了一个有歧义的形式[bsrt],既可指Bert也可指Big Bird。","He reduced consonant clusters in “spoon,” “plane,” and “stroller,” and he devoiced final stops as in “Big Bird.”In devoicing the final [d] in “bird,” he created an ambiguous form [bәrt] referring both to Bert and Big Bird."
9475,难怪只有父母理解孩子的第一批词！,No wonder only parents understand their children’s first words!
9476,词网是由普林斯顿大学开发的在线词典，其成千上万条目旨在满足一些计算词典学家的需求，尤其强调语义关系。,"Wordnet is an online dictionary (developed at Princeton University) with tens of thousands of entries that attempts to satisfy some of the needs of computational linguists, with emphasis on semantic relationships."
9476,全球各个机构正致力于研发其它此类项目。,Other similar projects are ongoing at various institutions.
9476,"在未来的几年里, 期望运用于计算语言学的电子词典学取得重大进展。","Over the next few years, expect to see significant progress in electronic lexicography for computational linguistic applications."
9477,此外，双语儿童在每种语言中的词汇量起初都比单语儿童在一种语言中的少。,"Also, bilingual children have smaller vocabularies in each of their languages than the monolingual child has in her one language."
9477,出现这种情况是有道理的，毕竟一个儿童每天只能学会那么多词，而双语儿童要同时建立两个词库。,"This makes sense because a child can only learn so many words a day, and the bilingual child has two lexicons to build."
9477,出于以上理由，在语言发展的一个可比较的阶段，双语儿童的词汇空缺可能会比单语儿童更多，并且这些空缺在每种语言中还可能有所不同。,"For these reasons the bilingual child may have more lexical gaps than the monolingual child at a comparable stage of development, and those gaps may be different for each language."
9478,心理语言学的实验研究的目标就是发现语言运用中的单位、阶段和过程。,"Psycholinguistic experimental studies are aimed at uncovering the units, stages, and processes involved in linguistic performance."
9478,好些实验技术已经被证明是有用的。,Several experimental techniques have proven to be very helpful.
9478,在词汇判定任务中，如果受试者认为口头的或笔头的刺激信息是一个词，则要求他们通过按钮对该刺激信息做出反应。,"In a lexical decision task, subjects are asked to respond to spoken or written stimuli by pressing a button if they consider the stimulus to be a word."
9478,在命名任务中，受试者阅读书面的刺激信息。,"In naming tasks, subjects read from printed stimuli."
9479,词汇提取的许多特征可以通过词汇判定实验来检验。,Many properties of lexical access can be examined using lexical decision experiments.
9479,在以下例子中，当前呈现的词和刚刚呈现 过的词之间的关系被控制起来。,"In the following example, the relationship between the current word and the immediately preceding word is manipulated."
9479,例如，当受试者判定doctor( 医生）一词时，倘若刚刚判定的词是 nurse (护士），而不是与doctor语义上毫无关系的词，如flower (花朵），那么前者判定的速度就更快。,"For example, making a lexical decision on the word doctor will be faster if you just made a lexical decision on nurse than if you just made one on a semantically unrelated word such as flower."
9479,这种效应称为“语义启动”：我们说mirse—词启动doctor—词。,This effect is known as semantic priming: we say that the word nurse primes the word doctor.
9479,这种效应的成因也许在于语义相关的词处于心理词库的同一区域，因此，当我们听到一个启动词并在心理词库中查寻它时，它附近语义上与之相关的词会被“唤醒”，更容易在短时间内提取。,"This effect might arise because semantically related words are located in the same part of the mental lexicon, so when we hear a priming word and look it up in the lexicon, semantically related, nearby words are “awakened” and more readily accessible for a few moments."
9480,掌握一种语言意味着懂得如何产生并理解数量无限的句子的意义。,Knowing a language means knowing how to produce and understand the meaning of infinitely many sentences.
9480,对语言意义的研究称为语义学。,The study of linguistic meaning is called semantics.
9480,词汇语义学研究语素与词的意义；组构语义学则研究短语和句子。,Lexical semantics is concerned with the meanings of morphemes and words; compositional semantics with phrases and sentences.
9480,对语境如何影响意义的研究称为语用学。,The study of how context affects meaning is called pragmatics.
9481,一些语言还有外接缀，指的是在同一个词基语素的开头和末尾附加上的语素，有时候也被称为非连续语素。,"Some languages have circumfixes, morphemes that are attached to a base morpheme both initially and finally.These are sometimes called discontinuous morphemes."
9481,在美国俄克拉荷马州有一种属于印第安土著马斯科吉语系的奇卡索语，词的否定形式通过前缀ik-和后缀-o共同组成。,"In Chickasaw, a Muskogean language spoken in Oklahoma, the negative is formed with both a prefix ik- and the suffix -o."
9481,在加上表示否定的后缀之前，肯定形式末尾的元音会先脱落。,The final vowel of the affirmative is dropped before the negative suffix is added.
9482,乔姆斯基派的语言学家加上格棱伯格派的调查，使我们的境界提升了很多，看得又深又远。,"Chomskyan linguistics, in combination with Greenbergian surveys, allows us to go well beyond this basic spec sheet."
9482,我们现在可以说第四章到第六章所谈到的文法机制是世界上所有语言都在用的。,It is safe to say that the grammatical machinery we used for English in Chapters 4-6 is used in all the world's languages.
9482,世界上所有语言，它的词汇都是成千上万，都有按口语的词性来分名词和动词。,"All languages have a vocabulary in the thousands or tens of thousands, sorted into part-of-speech categories including nouns and verbs."
9483,图2.4和2.5展示了一个布罗卡失语症患者和一个韦尼克失语症患者的MRI脑扫描图像。,Figures 2.4 and 2.5 show MRI scans of the brains of a Broca’s aphasic patient and a Wernicke’s aphasic patient.
9483,黑色区域显示了损伤的部位。,The black areas show the sites of the lesions.
9483,每幅图代表了大脑左半球的一个切面。,Each diagram represents a slice of the left side of the brain.
9484,把冲动作为一个起点在某些地方就带有误导性。,To take the stimulus as a starting-point is in some ways misleading.
9484,在我们随时有可能接受到的可能发生的冲动中，只有少数发生实际的效用。,"Of the possible stimuli which we might at any moment receive, only a few actually take effect."
9484,哪些冲动是接受到的，哪些冲动是随之而来的，这就取决于我们的兴趣中哪些是主动性的。也就是说，取决于我们活动的总的心理趋向。,"Which are received and which  impulses ensue  depends  upon which  of  our  interests  is active,  upon  the  general  set,  that  is,  of  our   activities."
9484,这个趋向很大程度上受制于反复出现而且持续存在的人体需要的状况，满足或躁动的状况。,"This  is conditioned  in  a  large  degree  by  the  state,  of   satisfaction  or unrest, of the recurrent and persistent needs of the body."
9484,挨饿的时候我们对烹调香味的刺激的反应不同于吃饱的时候。,When hungry and when replete we respond differently to the stimulus of  a smell of  cooking.
9485,"可以说,我从来也没有与自己完全同一,我总是一个已被抛到我自己前面去的存在。","I am never purely identical with myself, so to speak, but a being always already thrown forwards in advance of myself."
9485,"我的存在从来都不是我可以作为已完成的对象而加以把握的东西,它始终是新的可能性,始终是悬而未决。这就等于说，人的存在是由历史或时间构成的。","My existence is never something which I can grasp as a finished object, but always a question of fresh possibility, always problematic; and this is equivalent to saying that a human being is constituted by history, or time."
9486,«S/Z»记录了巴尔特对法国现实主义大师巴尔扎克的短篇小说《萨拉西纳》，即所谓“读者韵”作品那种几乎是毁灭性的分析。,"S/Z  is  the  record  of  Barthes’s  almost  literally  shattering  analysis  of Sarrasine, a ‘readerly’ short story by the arch-realist French writer Balzac."
9486,巴尔特的目的是要证明文本完全具有能指作用的性质。,Barthes’s aim is to demonstrate the text’s totally signifying nature.
9486,他的方法是把小说分为（或用他的话说，用一种类似“小小的方式”把它“拆散”拆成五百六十一个调汇单位 (长短不一的阅读单位），然后用下列五种代码分析这些文本的能指。,"His method is to divide the story (or, in his words, to ‘separate’ it ‘in the manner  of  a  minor  earthquake')  into  561  lexias  (reading units of  considerably  varying  length)  and  then  to  analyse  these  ‘textual signifiers’ in terms of five codes, as follows."
9487,在音系方面，J .P .和处于这个阶段的大多数幼儿一样，他的第一批词一般都是CV(辅音——元音）组配的单音节形式。,"In terms of his phonology, J. P. is like most children at the one-word stage.The first words are generally monosyllabic with a CV (consonant-vowel) form."
9487,元音部分可能是双元音，这取决于习得的是什么语言。,"The vowel part may be a diphthong, depending on the language being acquired."
9487,他的音位或语音总藏——在这个阶段两者是一回事——数量比成人语言少得多。,The phonemic inventory is much smaller than is found in the adult language.
9488,世界上许多现代语言起初是同一种语言的地域方言，后来被广泛使用，区别日渐扩大，最后各自变成独立的语言。,"Many modern languages developed from regional dialects that became widely spoken and highly differentiated, finally becoming separate languages."
9488,罗曼语族诸语言——法语、西班牙语等等，曾是古罗马帝国所使用的拉丁语的各种方言。,"The Romance languages—French, Spanish, and so on—were once dialects of Latin spoken in the Roman Empire."
9488,方 音并非“退化”，而是自然音变造成的——凡有人说话，就有音变。,There is nothing degenerate about regional pronunciations.They are the result of natural sound changes that occur wherever human language is spoken.
9489,与第一语言学习者一样，L2学习者也建构目标语的语法，他们也要经历被称为“中间语语法”的阶段。,"In second language acquisition, L2 learners construct grammars of the target language—called interlanguage grammars—that go through stages, like the grammars of first-language learners."
9489,在第二语言习得中，来自习得者第一语言的影响使得L2习得与L1习得有所不同。,Influence from the speaker’s first language makes L2 acquisition appear different from L1 acquisition.
9489,成人的L2通常达不到类似母语者的能力水平，特别是在发音方面。,"Adults often do not achieve native-like competence in their L2, especially in pronunciation."
9489,在青春期以后学习其他语言时会碰到困难，可能是因为存在着 L2 习得的敏感期。,Thedifficulties encountered in attempting to learn languages after puberty may be because there are sensitive periods for L2 acquisition.
9489,有些第二语言习得的理论认为，解释第一语言习得的那些原则在第二语言习得中也起作用。另一种观点则认为，与成年人学习第二语言相关的是一般的学习机制，而不是儿童习得语言时所用的特定语言规则。,Some theories of second language acquisition suggest that the same principles operate that account for first language acquisition.
9490,1874年，也就是布罗卡区发现13年之后，德国的神经病学家卡尔·韦尼克描述了另一种失语症：病人的脑损部位是在大脑左半球的后部，现称为“韦尼克区”。,"A decade later Carl Wernicke, a German neurologist, described another variety of aphasia that occurred in patients with lesions in areas of the left hemisphere temporal lobe, now known as Wernicke’s area."
9490,这也就是说，语言的定位偏侧于大脑左半球。,"Language, then, is lateralized to the left hemisphere, and the left hemisphere appears to be the language hemisphere from infancy on."
9490,偏侧化是一个术语，用来指被主要定位到脑某一侧的任何一种认知功能。,Lateralization is the term used to refer tothe localization of function to one hemisphere of the brain.
9491,"不要以为他们的动词都没有时态变化，所以语言太粗糙。这些动词go, stay, came, 或短语one time不是偶然的英文用字，而是夏威夷克 里奧语文法的往常性系统化用法。这些字己经被克里奥语的使用者转化成助词、介词，表示“格”的标记及相关代词。","Do not be misled by what look like crudely placed English verbs, such as go, stay, and came, or phrases like one time.They are not haphazard uses of English words but systematic uses of Hawaiian Creole grammar: the words have been converted by the creole speakers into auxiliaries, prepositions, case markers, and relative pronouns."
9492,先把句子摊开在干净的平台上，例如熨衣板。,"First spread the sentence out on a clean, flat surface, such as an ironing board."
9492,然后用一支很尖的铅笔或小刀找到述语，这是表示动作发生的地方，这通常是在鳃的正后方。例如，“LaMonte never would of bit a forest range.,"Then, using a sharp pencil or X-Acto knife, locate the ''predicate,"" which indicates where the action has taken place and is usually located directly behind the gills. For example, in the sentence: ''LaMont never would of bit a forest ranger,"" the action probably took place in a forest."
9492,”中，这个动作很可能是在森林中发生的，所以你画的图就要像颗树的形状，有小树枝伸出来表示句子中各个部件地点，例如你的动名词，格言等等。,"Thus your diagram would be shaped like a little tree with branches sticking out of it to indicate the locations of the various particles of speech, such as your gerunds, proverbs, etc."
9493,当我们问人类语言是什么时，我们发现它与动物通讯系统之间没有明显的相似之处。在把动物和人的通讯混在一起的抽象层次上，我们对行为或思想说不出什么有益的东西。,"When we ask what human language is, we find no striking similarity to animal communication systems.There is nothing useful to be said about behavior or thought at the level of abstraction at which animal and human communication fall together."
9493,迄今所考察过的动物通讯的例子确实具有人的手势语系统的许多性质；而且在这种情况下探求二者间直接关联的可能性，也是合理的。,"The examples of animal communication that have been examined to date do share many of the properties of human gestural systems, and it might be reasonable to explore the possibility of direct connection in this case."
9494,大约两周岁时儿童开始遣词造句。,"Around the time of their second birthday, children begin to put words together."
9494,起先他们的语句看似就是把两个儿童早期的独词语连成串，每个词都有自己的单音高曲拱。,"At first these utterances appear to be strings of two of the child’s earlier holophrastic utterances, each word with its own single-pitch contour."
9494,很快他们就开始构成句法和语义关系都很清楚的真正的两词句。,"Soon, they begin to form actual two-word sentences with clear syntactic and semantic relations."
9495,肺部气流流出口鼻时的不同方式会影响语音。,Speech sounds also vary in the way the airstream is affected as it flows from the lungs up and out of the mouth and nose.
9495,气流可以被完全阻断，或部分受阻；声带可能振动，也可能不振动。,It may be blocked or partially blocked; the vocal cords may vibrate or not vibrate.
9495,我们把这些叫作调音方式。,We refer to this as the manner of articulation.
9496,短语范畴的内部结构有普遍性，包括一个中心语和中心语的补足语。,The internal structure of the phrasal categories is universal.It consists of a head and its complements.
9496,在短语中构成成分的特定顺序是由每种语言的短语结构规则（PS规则）所规定的。,The particular order of elements within the phrase is accounted for by the phrase structure rules of each language.
9496,"NP,VP等以名词、动词等作为中心语。","NPs, VPs, and so on are headed by nouns, verbs, and the like."
9496,句子（S或TP)是以Aux(或T) 作为中心语，用以标明时态、一致关系和情态等信息。,"The sentence (S or TP) is headed by Aux (or T), which carries such information as tense, agreement, and modality."
9497,带有句法范畴信息的树形图被称为短语结构树或是成分结构树。,A tree diagram with syntactic category information is called a phrase structure tree or a constituent structure tree.
9497,这棵树表明这个句子既是线性的一串词，又是短语套短语的层级结构。,This tree shows that a sentence is both a linear string of words and a hierarchical structure with phrases nested in phrases.
9497,短语结构树（简称为PS 树）清楚地用图形表征了说话者关于他所使用的语言中句子结构的知识。,"Phrase structure trees (PS trees, for short) are explicit graphic representations of a speaker’s knowledge of the structure of the sentences of his language."
9498,wh 短语移动造成的长距离依存关系是人类语言最基本的部分。,“Long-distance” dependencies created by wh movement are a fundamental part of human language.
9498,这进一步表明了句子不仅仅只是词的串接，还要短语结构树搭建起繁复的脚手架作为支撑。,They provide still further evidence that sentences are not simply strings of words but are supported by a rich scaffolding of phrase structure trees.
9498,这些树表明了一个句子的底层结构及其与该语言中其他句子之间的关系，同时还总是能够反映你的句法知识。,"These trees express the underlying structure of a sentence as well as its relation to other sentences in the language, and as always are reflective of a person’s knowledge of syntax."
9499,每个半球都表现出对侧控制功能。,Each hemisphere exhibits contralateral control of functions.
9499,大脑左半球控制着人体的右侧，右半球控制着人体的左侧。,"The left hemisphere controls the right side of the body, and the right hemisphere controls the left side."
9499,尽管人体总体上是对称的，但大量证据表明人脑是不对称的，通过偏侧化大脑的左右两半球有不同的功能。,"Despite the general symmetry of the human body, much evidence suggests that the brain is asymmetric, with the left and right hemispheres lateralized for different functions."
9500,"我认为，这意味着列维-斯特劳斯认为他已取得一种具有""一套转换规则”的分析方法，使我们能够从神话的一种变体转到另一种变体。","This means, I take it, that Lévi-Strauss believes he has arrived at a method of analysis which furnishes ‘rules of transformation’ enabling us to shift from one variant of the myth to another."
9500,"在这种过程中，我们可以看到一种中介的、有效的、“创造出真实”的力量在活动，这股力量可以制伏“残醅的"" 现实并使之转化为自己的意象。","In the process, a mediating, validating, ‘true-making’ agency can be seen to operate which overcomes ‘brute’ reality and transforms it into its own image."
9500,"神话就作为这种活动的必不可少的""逻辑工具'。通过这种活动，在社会里，我们在前进中不断“弥补”现实，解决事实上不可能解决的“对立”，从而使我们的经验足以证明我们的理论前提，这个前提就是：“神话思维总是从对立的意识出发，朝着对立的解决而前进。”","Myth emerges as the ‘logical tool’ essential to this operation: one whereby we, in society, ‘make up’ reality as we go along, resolve what are in fact unresolvable ‘oppositions’, and so make our experiences adequate to our theoretical presuppositions: ‘mythical thought always progresses from the awareness of oppositions toward their resolution’."
9501,即使如此，一些批评方法比另一些缺少方法性这一事实也还是会使那些相信任何事物中都有一点真理的多元主义者大受其窘。,"Even so, the fact that some critical methods are less methodical than others proves something of an embarrassment to the pluralists who believe that there is a little truth in everything."
9501,（这种理论多元主义亦有其政治对应物：试图理解每一个人的观点经常暗示着你自己是高高在上或允执其中的；打算把互相冲突的观点溶为一体则意味着拒绝这样的真理；有些冲突能够只从一方加以解决。）,"(This theoretical pluralism also has its political correlative: seeking to understand everybody's point of view quite often suggests that you yourself are disinterestedly up on high or in the middle, and trying to resolve conflicting viewpoints into a consensus implies a refusal of the truth that some conflicts can be resolved on one side alone.)"
9502,拉康本人对于他的理论与社会的相关性并没有太多的兴趣，他当然也没有“解决”社会与潜意识的关系问题。,"Lacan himself is not much interested in the social relevance of his theories, and he certainly does not 'solve' the problem of the relation between society and the unconscious."
9502,然而，作为整体的弗洛伊德主义却的确能使我们提出这个问题；现在我想从一部具体的文学作品，D·H·劳伦斯的小说《儿子与情人》，来考察这个问题。,"Freudianism as a whole, however, does enable us to pose this question; and I want now to examine it in terms of a concrete literary example, D. H. Lawrence's novel Sons and Lovers."
9502,甚至那些怀疑“俄狄浦斯情结”这类用语是外来术语的保守主义批评家有时也承认，这篇小说中有某种东西在起作用，而这种东西看来很像是弗洛伊德的那个著名的情结。,"Even conservative critics, who suspect such phrases as the 'Oedipus complex' as alien jargon, sometimes admit that there is something at work in this text which looks remarkably like Freud's famous drama."
9503,莪相作诗时，不是像现代诗人那样为了取悦读者和批评家。,"Ossian did not write, like modern poets, to please readers and critics."
9503,他是出于对诗和歌的热爱而歌唱的。,He sung from the love of poetry and song.45
9503,45换用亚当•弗格森的隐喻来说，原始诗人“撕遣心中的情感，用的也是心灵中产生的语词；他只知道这种语词”46。,"Or, in the alternate metaphor of Adam Ferguson，the primitive poet ‘delivers the emotions of the heart, in words suggested by the heart; for he knows no other.’46"
9504,在希腊语的软腭/硬颚塞音与擦音的这个例子里，无论选哪一组作为底层，规则都一样简单。,"In the case of the velar and palatal stops and fricatives in Greek, the rules appear to be equally simple."
9504,但是，除了简明性标准之外，我们还希望规则可以用自然音变来解释。,"However, in addition to the simplicity criterion, we wish to state rules that have natural phonetic explanations."
9504,这也常常是最简单的解决方法。,Often these turn out to be the simplest solution.
9504,在很多语言中，软腭音在前元音前面变成硬腭音。,"In many languages, velar sounds become palatal before front vowels."
9504,这是一条同化规则。,"This is an assimilation rule; palatal sounds are produced toward the front of the mouth, as are front vowels."
9504,"因此我们选择/k/作为音位变体[k]和[c]的音位,以及/x/作为音位变体[x]和[ç]的音位。","Thus we select /k/ as a phoneme with the allophones [k] and [c], and /x/ as a phoneme with the allophones [x] and [ç]."
9505,相反，弗洛伊德对于梦的解释却使我们能够把文学作品看作一种生产而非一个“反映”。,"Freud's account of the dream, by contrast, enables us to see the work of literature not as a reflection but as a form of production."
9505,像梦一样，作品也利用一些“原材料”——语言、其他文学作品、感受世界的方式——并且依靠某些技术把它们转变成为产品。,"Like the dream, the work takes certain 'raw materials' — language, other literary texts, ways of perceiving the world — and transforms them by certain techniques into a product."
9505,使这种生产得以实现的技术是我们认作“文学形式”的各种艺术手段。,The techniques by which this production is carried out are the various devices we know as 'literary form'.
9505,文学作品在加工它的原料时，往往会把这些原料纳入它自己的二次修正形式；除非它是像《菲尼根的守灵》那样的“革命性”作品，不然它总会试图将原料组成条理一贯、可以消费的整体，即使它并非总是成功，如《儿子与情人》的情况那样。,"In working on its raw materials, the literary text will tend to submit them to its own form of secondary revision: unless it is a 'revolutionary' text like Finnegans Wake, it will try to organize them into a reasonably coherent, consumable whole, even if, as with Sons and Lovers, it will not be always successful."
9506,与上面的观点相反，另一些人争辩说成年人解决各类非语言问题的能力都比儿童的强。,"Opposing this view, others have argued that adults are superior to children in solving all sorts of nonlinguistic problems."
9506,"如果他们把这些解决问题的才能用于学习L2,那么他们不是应该全都比现在要学得更成功一些吗？","If they were using these problemsolving skills to learn their L2, shouldn’t they be uniformly more successful than they are?"
9506,一些语言天才的例子，如第二章中讨论过的克里斯托弗，也反对这种认为L2习得只涉及非语言认知能力的观点。,"Also, linguistic savants such as Christopher, discussed in chapter 2, argue against the view that L2 acquisition involves only nonlinguistic cognitive abilities."
9506,克里斯托弗的智商和问题解决技能最多也只是最低限度的，然而他却娴熟地掌握了好几门语言。,"Christopher’s IQ and problem-solving skills are minimal at best, yet he has become proficient in several languages."
9507,有些词是它们自己的反义词。,Some words are their own antonyms.
9507,这些“自反义词” 是这样一些词：例如cleave(切开/黏住)和dust(擦掸/撒扬)，后者可分别用在dusting furniture(擦拭/掸除家具上的灰尘)和dusting crops(扬谷)。,"These “autoantonyms” or “contranyms” are words such as cleave “to split apart” or “to cling together” and dust “to remove something” or “to spread something,” as in dusting furniture or dusting crops."
9507,拼写不同但是发音一样的反义词对和自反义词类似：raise (种植，喂养，募集)和raze(拆毁，抹除)就是这样一个词对。,Antonymic pairs that are pronounced the same but spelled differently are similar to autoantonyms: raise and raze are one such pair.
9508,毫无疑问，结构主义形式了对主流批评，即新批评和利维斯派批评以及一般的人文主义批评实践的主要挑战。,"There is no doubt that structuralism represented a major challenge to the dominant New Critical, Leavisite, and generally humanist types of critical practice."
9508,他们全都采用一种语言能够把握一切现实的观点。,They all presupposed a view of language as something capable of grasping reality.
9508,过去，语言被认为是作者头脑或者是作者看到的世界的反映。,Language had been thought of as a reﬂection of either the writer’s mind or the world as seen by the writer.
9508,在某种意义上，语言是很难与作者的人格分离的；它表达了作者本人的存在。,In a sense the writer’s language was hardly separable from his or her personality; it expressed the author’s very being.
9509,当不同的群体说某种语言的方式存在系统性的变异，那么我们就认为每个群体说的是该语言的一种方言。,"When there are systematic differences in the way groups speak a language, we say that each group speaks a dialect of that language."
9509,方言是存在系统差异的语言能够互相理解的形式。,Dialects are mutually intelligible forms of a language that differ in systematic ways.
9509,每个讲话者，不论贫富，也无论所属地域或种族，都至少能说一种方言，这就像每个人都能说一种个人方言一样。,"Every speaker, whether rich or poor, regardless of region or racial origin, speaks at least one dialect, just as each individual speaks an idiolect."
9510,但北美英语中有一种方言仍然是这种无知偏见的受害者。,"There is, however, a social dialect of North American English that has been a victim of prejudicial ignorance."
9510,这种方言就是非裔美国人英语(AAE)，它是众多非裔美国人所讲的方言。,"This dialect, African American English (AAE),1 is spoken by a large population of Americans of African descent."
9510,由于社会、教育和经济的原因，这种英语方言的区别特征一直都存在。,"The distinguishing features of this English dialect persist for social, educational, and economic reasons."
9511,分析这类句子的困难在于它与记忆限制有关。,The difficulty in parsing this kind of sentence is related to memory constraints.
9511,在处理这个句子的过程中，你不得不一直记住the malt（麦芽）这个短语，直到你听到动词ate ( 吃了）。可是在此过程中，你又不得不一直记住the rat（老鼠）这个短语，直到你听到动词killed ( 灭了）。而在这样做时，以此类推…… 。,"In processing the sentence, you have to keep the malt in mind all the way until ate, but while doing that you have to keep the rat in mind all the way until killed, and while doing that. . . ."
9512,我们已经表明，在人类社会里，语言明显地起支配作用并被普遍认为是占支配地位的交流手段。,"It has already been argued that in human societies, language clearly plays a commanding role and is generally taken to be the predominant means of communication."
9512,但是同样明显的是，人类也借助非语词手段进行交流，所使用的方式因而可以说或者是非语言的（尽管语言模式仍然是规范的而且占支配地位的），或者是能够“扩展”我们关于语言的概念，直到这一概念包括非言语的领域为止。事实上，这种“扩展”恰好是符号学的伟大成就。,"But it is also clear that human beings communicate by nonverbal means and in ways which must consequently be  said  to  be  either  non-linguistic  (although  the mode of  language remains  formative  and  dominant)  or  which  must  have  the  effect  of‘stretching’ our concept of language until it includes non-verbal areas.In fact, such ‘stretching’ is precisely the great achievement of semiotics."
9513,随着布拉格学派的著作，术语“结构主义”与“符号学”一词或多或少地混合了。,"With the work of the Prague school, the term 'structuralism' comes more or less to merge with the word ‘semiotics’."
9513,“符号学”意味着对于符号的系统研究，而这也是文学结构主义者实际进行的工作，“结构主义”一词本身表明一种研究方法，它可以被应用于从足球比赛到经济生产方式等完整的对象系列；“符号学”表示一个相当特殊的研究领域，即系统领域。这些系统在一般意义上被看作符号: 诗、鸟语、交通信号、病症等等。,"‘Semiotics’, or ‘semiology’, means the systematic study of signs, and this is what literary structuralists are really doing.The word ‘structuralism’ itself indicates a method of enquiry, which can be applied to a whole range of objects from football matches to economic modes of production; ‘semiotics’ denotes rather a particular field of study, that of systems which would in an ordinary sense be regarded as signs: poems, bird calls, traffic lights, medical symptoms and so on."
9514,先锋派诗人不论男女都进入了母亲的身体，都抵抗了父亲的名字。,"The avant-garde poet, man or woman, enters the Body-of- the-Mother and resists the Name-of-the-Father."
9514,例如，马拉美通过颠覆句法法则来颠覆父亲法则，通过恢复“母性的”符号流来认同母亲身份。,"Mallarmé, for example, by subverting the laws of syntax subverts the Law of the Father, and identifies with the mother through his recovery of the ‘maternal’ semiotic flux."
9514,在文学中，符号与象征的交汇，符号的在象征的中释放出来，从而形成语言“游戏”。,"In literature, the meeting of the semiotic and the symbolic, where the former is released in the latter, results in linguistic ‘play’."
9515,或许，他想，这是孩子在倾听父母说话时学来的，他们会听在父母所用的复合字中，哪些复数是不规则的，哪些是规则的，或者两者兼而有之，然后把他们听到的复合字复制出来。,"Perhaps, he reasoned, they learned it from their parents by listening for whether the plurals that occur inside the parents' compounds are irregular, regular, or both, and then duplicate whatever kinds of compounds they hear."
9515,但是他发现这是不可能的，母亲跟孩子说的话根本不会有不规则复数的复合字。,"This would be impossible, he discovered.Motherese just doesn't have any compounds containing plurals."
9515,大多数的复合字如toothbrush里面包含的是单数名词。mice-infested虽然是合文法，但是很少这么用。,"Most compounds are like ""toothbrush"", with singular nouns inside them; compounds like ""mice-infested"", though grammatically possible, are seldom used."
9515,"小孩子说mice-eater但从不说rats-eater,他们不可能从大人的说话中得到语言是该这样用的规则。","The children produced ""mice-eater"" but never ""rats-eater"", even though they had no evidence from adult speech that this is how languages work."
9516,病人可能以人们所熟悉的一系列手段对分析者进行抵制，不让他接近她的潜意识。但是如果一切顺利的话，我们能通过感情转移过程设法使她的问题进入意识，然后，通过在适当时机解除这种移情关系，有希望把她从这些问题中解脱出来。,"The patient is likely to resist the analyst's access to her unconscious by a number of familiar techniques, but if all goes well the transferential process will allow her problems to be 'worked through' into consciousness, and by dissolving the transference relation at the right moment the analyst will hope to relieve her of them."
9516,这一过程的另一种描述方法是说，病人开始能回亿起她压抑到潜意识的那一部分生活：她能够以新的方式更完整地讲述她自己的经历，通过讲述解释和理解她所经历的精神障碍。这就意味着所谓的谈话治疗已经见效。,"Another way of describing this process is to say that the patient becomes able to recollect portions of her life which she has repressed: she is able to recount a new, more complete narrative about herself, one which will interpret and make sense of the disturbances from which she suffers.The 'talking cure', as it is called, will have taken effect."
9517,那么，我们究竟如何区分“人咬狗”跟“狗咬人”呢？,So how do we actually distinguish “Man bites dog” from “Dog bites man”?
9517,在字典上，咬的定义写的是“咬的人是主语，被咬的东西是受词”，但是我们如何在树状图上找到主语和受词呢?,The dictionary entry for “bite” says ''The biter is the subject; the bitten thing is the object.'' But how do we find subjects and objects in the tree?
9517,文法规则在名词短语上挂了个小标签，使它可以跟动词意义所规范的角色相配合。,Grammar puts little tags on the noun phrases that can be matched up with the roles laid out in a verb's dictionary entry.
9517,这个小标签就叫做“格”。,These tags are called cases.
9517,在许多语言里，这个格是以名词的字首或字尾变化的形式出现。,"In many languages, cases appear as prefixes or suffixes on the nouns."
9518,儿童学习语言时对语法的重构会引起语言的变化。,Change comes about through the restructuring of the grammar and lexicon by children learning the language.
9518,语法可以简化与规则化，就像印欧语中格形态的丢失一样。但这种简化会被其他方面的复杂化所补偿，例如词序变得更为严格。,"Grammars may appear to change in the direction of simplicity and regularity, as in the loss of the Indo-European case morphology, but such  implifications may be compensated for by other complexities, such as stricter word order."
9518,在简单（语言必须是可以学会的）和复杂（语言必须富于表现力并且相对来说没有歧义）之间，总是保持着一定的平衡。,A balance is always present between simplicity— languages must be learnable—and complexity—languages must be expressive and relatively unambiguous.
9519,计算形态学就是通过计算机来处理词汇结构的学问。,The processing of word structures by computers is computational morphology.
9519,计算机必须知道词汇的结构才能理解词义，才能以正确的语法形式来使用词汇。,The computer needs to understand the structure of words both to understand the words and to use the words in a grammatically correct way.
9519,为了处理词汇，计算机中设定了查找词根和词缀的程序。,"To process words, the computer is programmed to look for roots and affixes."
9520,我们或许还得对三种情况加以区别。,"One might distinguish, then, between three different analytical situations."
9520,如果两则神话的意义或功能相同，那它们之间的关系是可以确定的。,"Given two myths with similar meanings or functions, it should be possible to establish relations between them."
9520,如果两则神话都属于同一文化，而且关于该文化中表示特征区别的信息也能得到，那么，比较的条件就已经具备。,"Alternatively, when two myths are taken from the same culture and information about the distinctions used in the culture is available, one also has grounds for comparison."
9521,总而言之，使历史清晰可知的模式也就是文学叙述的模式。,"The model for historical intelligibility, in short, is literary narrative."
9521,我们会听故事、读故事的人都善于评判一个故事的情节是否合乎情理，是否紧凑，这个故事是否已经讲完。,"We who hear and read stories are good at telling whether a plot makes sense, hangs together, or whether the story remains unfinished."
9521,如果使情节发展合情合理，能成为故事的模式具有与历史叙述的模式相同的特点，那么把二者区分开就不是一个很重要的理论问题了。,"If the same models of what makes sense and what counts as a story characterize both literary and historical narratives, then distinguishing between them need not seem an urgent theoretical matter."
9522,当另一种分析方法发现Russian(俄罗斯人）和women( 女人）这两个名词在一起时，它就推断有一个关系小句存在。如果women (女人）前面有词that，那么该关系小句就会凸现出来了（但英语允许省略掉that)。,"The other parse, when it sees the two nouns “Russian women” together, deduces the presence of a relative clause, which would have been obvious if the word that had preceded women (but English allows it to be left out)."
9522,因此，分析程序能够把一个名词短语范畴指派给The Russian women loved (女人们爱慕的那个俄罗斯人）。,The parser is then able to assign the category of noun phrase to “The Russian women loved”.
9522,这样，前面的那个句子可以分析为以died充当动词短语结尾的句子（女人们爱慕的那个俄罗斯人死了）。至此，这种分析方法就成功完成了对该句的分析。,"The sentence is completed with the verb died, which can form a verb phrase, and the parse finishes successfully."
9523,洛思语法这样的规定语法，不同于我们一直在讨论的描写语法。,Prescriptive grammars such as Lowth’s are different from the descriptive grammars we have been discussing.
9523,规定语法的目标不是描写人们所知道的规则，而是告诉人们应该遵循什么规则。,"Their goal is not to describe the rules people know, but to tell them what rules they should follow."
9523,了不起的英国首相温斯顿•丘吉尔就英语中的句子不能以介词结尾这一 “规则”说过这么一句话：It is a rule up with which we should not put (这是一条我们不应该再忍受的规则。）,The great British Prime Minister Winston Churchill is credited with this response to the “rule” against ending a sentence with a preposition: “This is the sort of nonsense up with which I will not put.”
9524,规则的语音对应说明了音系的演变。,Regular sound correspondences illustrate changes in the phonological system of a language.
9524,"在前面的章节我们讨论了说话者有关自己语言音系的知识 ,其中包括有关该语言中音位和音系规则的知识。","In earlier chapters we discussed speakers’ knowledge of phonology, including knowledge of the phonemes and phonological rules of the language."
9524,音系的这些方面都会发生变化。,Either of these aspects of the phonology is subject to change.
9525,这些诗句从语言学的意义上来说合乎语法，因为它们符合英语的词序和其他制约条件。,These lines are grammatical in the linguistic sense that they obey the word order and other constraints of English.
9525,这样无意义的诗歌之所以有趣，恰恰是因为诗句符合句法规则，而且听起来像地道的英语。,Such nonsense poetry is amusing precisely because the sentences comply with syntactic rules and sound like good English.
9525,不合语法的无意义词串，就毫无娱人之处了：*Toves slithy the and brillig ’twasWabe the in gimble and gyre did,Ungrammatical strings of nonsense words are not entertaining:*Toves slithy the and brillig ’twaswabe the in gimble and gyre did
9526,实际上，后结构主义并没有竭力揭示结构主义的不足或错误，而是转而研究是什么使文化现象成为可理解的，并且强调一种对知识、总体和主体的批评。,"In fact, post-structuralism does not demonstrate the inadequacies or errors of structuralism so much as turn away from the project of working out what makes cultural phenomena intelligible and emphasize instead a critique of knowledge, totality, and the subject.It treats each of these as a problematical effect."
9526,后结构主义把这三者中的每一个都作为必然结果来对待。,
9526,意义体系的结构并不是作为知识的对象而独立存在于主体之外的，它们是主体的结构，而主体又与产生它们的各种力量交叉在一起。,"The structures of the systems of signiﬁcation do not exist independently of the subject, as objects of knowledge, but are structures for subjects, who are entangled with the forces that produce them."
9527,"爱德华·赛义德在《东方主义》 (Orientalism, 1978年）中对欧洲话语知识建构的东方的“他人”进行了仔细的考察，对后殖民主义领域的形成极有帮助。","Edward Said’s Orientalism (1978), which examined the construction of the oriental ‘other’ by European discourses of knowledge, helped to establish the field."
9527,从那时起，后殖民主义理论己经成为一种力量，渗透到文化和知识的建构中。对于来自后殖民主义的知识分子，则是要用他们的方法去撰写别人已经写过的历史。,"Since then post-colonial theory and writing has become anattempt to intervene in the construction of culture and knowledge, and,for intellectuals who come from post-colonial societies, to write their way back into a history others have written."
9528,苏美尔人首先发明了一套图画文字系统，用以记录商业交易。,The Sumerians first developed a pictographic writing system to keep track of commercial transactions.
9528,这个系统后来又扩大到其他各种用途，最终发展成高度定形（尖头笔○写成的）的楔形文字。,It was later expanded for other uses and eventually evolved into the highly stylized (and stylus-ized) cuneiform writing.
9528,通过应 用画谜原则，楔形文字概括发展为其他的文字系统。画谜原则指用一个词或音节的符号代表与其读音相同的另一个词或音节。,"Cuneiform was generalized to other writing systems by application of the rebus principle, which uses the symbol of one word or syllable to represent another word or syllable pronounced the same."
9529,例如，西班牙语用/ñ/来 表 示 señor (先生）中的腭化鼻音音位；德语增加了一个变元音符号，来表示某些拉丁语中没有的某些元音 （如über“在 ……上方”）。,"For example, Spanish uses ñ to represent the palatalized nasal phoneme of señor, and German has added an umlaut for certain of its vowel sounds that did not exist in Latin (e.g., in über)."
9529,通过附加符号标记的增补，日语音节表中的46个假名就可以用来表示日语的100多个音节。,Diacritic marks supplement the forty-six kana of the Japanese syllabaries to enable them to represent the more than 100 syllables of the language.
9529,附加符号标记还可以用在泰语这样的声调语言的文字中，用来表示音节的声调。,Diacritic marks are also used in writing systems of tone languages such as Thai to indicate the tone of a syllable.
9530,假如牛顿描述的是真实，则诗人的彩虹就是幻觉；假如科学在总体上是真，那么诗在总体上则为假。《莱米亚》的基本主题一如济慈的许多主要诗篇，是幻觉与现实的斗争。,"If Newton describes reality, then the poet's rainbow is ant illusion; if science in general is true, then poetry in general is false.The basic theme in Lamia, as in so many of Keats's major poems, is that of illusion against reality."
9530,正如济慈自己所说，阿波罗尼斯这位冷漠的哲学家毕竟是对的。,"And after all, as Keats himself sets up the stoty, Apollonius, the cold philosopher, was right."
9531,为了建立我们在上面部分描述的文学体系，佛莱必须首先清除价值判断，因为它们只是主观的喧声。,"To establish his literary system, of which the above is only a partial account, Frye must first of all clear value-judgements out of the way, since these are merely subjective noises."
9531,当我们分析文学时，我们在谈文学；当我们评价文学时，我们却是在谈自己。,When we analyse literature we are speaking of literature; when we evaluate it we are speaking of ourselves.
9531,这个关系也必须排除文学史以外的任何历史：文学作品是由其他文学作品而不是由任何外在于文学系统的材料创造的。,"The system must also expel any history other than literary history: literary works are made out of other literary works, not out of any material external to the literary system itself."
9532,为了避免把观众诱导入一种被动的接受状态，必须采用陌生化效果（即间离效果）打碎现实的幻象。,"To avoid lulling the audience into a state of passive acceptance, the illusion of reality must be shattered by the use of the alienation effect."
9532,演员绝对不能迷失在他们扮演的角色中或者寻求一种纯粹移情式的观众认同。,The actors must not lose themselves in their roles or seek to promote a purely empathic audience identification.
9532,他们必须把一个既是可辨认的，又是不熟悉的角色呈现在观众面前，以便让他们不断地对角色做出批评性评估。,
9533,"从另一种意义上说,文学批评这种英美解构批评正是陈旧的新批评形式主义的复归。","Literary criticism, in another sense, as such Anglo-American deconstruction, is no more than the return of the old New Critical formalism."
9533,"当然，它是以一种强化形式复归的。因为对于新批评来说，诗确实是以某种间接的方式谈论诗以外的现实；而对于解构批评家来说,文学证明,语言除了像一个酒吧间的讨厌鬼一样谈论自己的缺陷以外，不可能再做更多的事情。","Indeed it returns in intensified form, because for New Criticism the poem did in some indirect way discourse about extra-poetic reality.Literature for the deconstructionists testifies to the impossibility of language's ever doing more than talking about its own failure, like some barroom bore."
9533,"文学毁灭了语言的一切指称功能, 埋葬了语言的交际作用。","Literature is the ruin of all reference, the cemetery of communication."
9534,解构可以最简单地定义为对构成西方思想按等级划分的一系列对立面的批评：内在与外在、思想与身体、非比喻与比喻、言说与书写、存在与不存在、自然与文化、形式与意义。,"Deconstruction is most simply defined as a critique of the hierarchical oppositions that have structured Western thought: inside/outside, mind/body, literal/metaphorical, speech/writing, presence/absence,nature/culture, form/meaning."
9534,要解构一个对立面就是要表明它原本不是自然且不可避免的，而是一个结构，是由依靠这个结构的话语所制造出来的，并且还要表明它是一个存在于一部解构作品之中的结构，而这种解构作品正是设法把结构拆开，并对它进行再描述—但这并不是要毁灭它，而是要赋予它一个不同的结构和作用。,"To deconstruct an opposition is to show that it is not natural and inevitable but a construction, produced by discourses that rely on it, and to show that it is a construction in a work of deconstruction that seeks to dismantle it and reinscribe it-that is, not destroy it but give it a different structure and functioning."
9534,但是作为-种解读的方法，用巴巴拉•约翰逊的说法，解构是“文本之中关于意义的各种论战力量之间的一种嬉戏”，是研究方式和意义之间的矛盾，就像语言的述行特点和述愿特点之间的矛盾一样。,"But as a mode of reading, deconstruction is, in Barbara Johnson’s phrase, a‘teasing out of warring forces of signification within a text’, an investigation of the tension between modes of signification, as between the performative and constative dimensions of language."
9535,对句7是一个变体这个事实，需要加以解释。,The fact that 7 is deviant requires explanation.
9535,这里的解释——在特殊语法的层次上——可以通过提出相应的语法规则而获得。这种语法规则在两种可能的深层结构中确定出一个，并只允许一种或是句5或是句6那样的扩展。,"The explanation in this case would be provided, at the level of particular grammar, by formulation of the grammatical rules that assign alternative deep structures and that in each case permit one but not the other of the extensions to 5 or 6."
9535,这样，我们就能把这种规则系统归结为掌握该语言的人所拥有的语言知识的一个方面，从而解释了句7的变异和句4的含糊性。,"We would then explain the deviance of 7 and the ambiguity of 4 by attributing this system of rules to the person who knows the language, as one aspect of his knowledge."
9536,对如此理解的普遍语法的研究也是对人类认知能力的研究。,"The study of universal grammar, so understood, is a study of the nature of human intellectual capacities."
9536,这种研究试图提出一套必要条件作为标准，来判别一种系统是否有资格作为人类语言。这些条件不是偶尔地与现存的人类语言相符合，而是深深地扎根于人类“语言能力”之中。这样就构成了天赋组织，它能够确定什么是语言经验以及从这些经验中产生出什么样的语言知识。,"It tries to formulate the necessary and sufficient conditions that a system must meet to qualify as a potential human language, conditions that are not accidentally true of the existing human languages, but that are rather rooted in the human “language capacity,” and thus constitute the innate organization that determines what counts as linguistic experience and what knowledge of language arises on the basis of this experience."
9536,这样，普遍语法就构成了一种比特殊语法更深一层的解释理论，虽然一种语言的特殊语法也可以被认为是一种解释理论。,"Universal grammar, then, constitutes an explanatory theory of a much deeper sort than particular grammar, although the particular grammar of a language can also be regarded as an explanatory theory."
9537,英语用同样富于表达力的介词系统取代了衰退的格系统。,English has replaced its depleted case system with an equally expressive system of prepositions.
9537,例如介词 to 常用来表示与格，介词of则表示属格。出现在动词后面的名词，如果中间没有插入介词，则该名词通常是宾格。,"For example, what would be the dative case is often indicated by the preposition to, the genitive case by the preposition of, and the accusative case by no preposition together with the word order V—NP in d-structure."
9538,还存在其他的句法范畴。,There are other syntactic categories.
9538,短语found a puppy是一个动词短语（VP)。,The expression found a puppy is a verb phrase (VP).
9538,动词短语总是有一个动词 (V)，还可能有其他的句法范畴，例如一个NP或介词短语（PP)。介词短语是后面跟着NP的介词。,"A verb phrase always contains a verb (V), and it may contain other categories, such as a noun phrase or prepositional phrase (PP), which is a preposition followed by an NP."
9539,精神分析的工作也许能用弗洛伊德的一句格言很好地概括：“哪里有本我，哪里就有自我。,"The work of psychoanalysis can perhaps best be summarized in one of Freud's own slogans: 'Where id was, there shall ego be.'"
9539,”哪里人们处在他们不能理解的力量的强大的支配之下，哪里理性和自制就应占上风。,"Where men and women were in the paralysing grip of forces which they could not comprehend, there reason and self-mastery shall reign."
9539,这样的格言使弗洛伊德听来比他实际上更像是一个理性主义者。,Such a slogan makes Freud sound rather more of a rationalist than he actually was.
9539,尽管他曾经说过，没有任何东西最终能够抵挡理性与经验，他还是尽量避免低估心灵的狡猾与顽固。,"Though he once commented that nothing in the end could withstand reason and experience, he was about as far from underestimating the cunning and obstinacy of the mind as it is possible to be."
9540,这里的规则5 不同于之前的规则，因为它重复了自己内部的范畴（VP），这就是递归规则的一个例子。,Rule 5 is different from the previous rules because it repeats its own category (VP) inside itself.This is an instance of a recursive rule.
9540,递归规则非常重要，因为这使得语法可以生成数量无限的句子。,Recursive rules are of critical importance because they allow the grammar to generate an infinite set of sentences.
9540,再次使用规则5表明，句法是如何允许出现带多个PP的结构的，正如句子The girl walked down the street with a gun toward the bank (那个女孩那时拿着一支枪沿着街道朝着银行走去）所示。,"Reapplying rule 5 shows how the syntax permits structures with multiple PPs, such as in the sentence “The girl walked down the street with a gun toward the bank.”"
9541,在第三章我们讲到每个词的句法范畴都储存在我们的心理词典当中。,In chapter 3 we discussed the fact that the syntactic category of each word is listed in our mental dictionaries.
9541,我们现在可以看到这一信息是如何为一种语言的句法所使用的。,We now see how this information is used by the syntax of the language.
9541,在树形图中，词出现在标明该词句法范畴的标记之下。,Words appear in trees under labels that correspond to their syntactic category.
9541,"名词上标N, 限定词上标Det , 动词上标V, 等等。","Nouns are under N, determiners under Det, verbs under V, and so on."
9542,如果说所有语言和英语句法规则的细节不尽相同，那么它们的类型还是相似的，这一点手语也不例外。,"All languages have rules of syntax similar in kind, if not in detAn introduction to language, to those of English, and sign languages are no exception."
9542,手语有给出层级结构和成分顺序的短语结构规则。,Signed languages have phrase structure rules that provide hierarchical structure and order constituents.
9542,手语者通过手势的顺序区别The dog chased the cat(狗追猫）和 The cat cliased the dog(猫追狗）。,A signer distinguishes The dog chased the cat from The cat chased the dog through the order of signing.
9542,"美国手语CASL)的基本词序是SVO,但是和英语不同的是，在ASL中形容词跟在名词中心语后面。","The basic order of ASL is SVO.Unlike English, however, adjectives follow the head noun in ASL."
9543,月亮最颧的时候，潮水便会涨髙。,When the moon is full the tides are higher.
9543,显然海水上涨与月亮变圆是相应的。,Clearly the seas swell in sympathy with the increase of the moon.
9543,"科学的历史上充满着神秘的独特实体，当解释进一雇的时候,它们就渐渐消失了。",The history of science is full of mysterious unique entities which have gradually evaporated as explanation advanced.
9544,一些语素组合本身是可能的，但从没有被使用过，这就是另一些词汇缺位的原因。,
9544,,Other gaps result when possible combinations of morphemes never come into use.
9544,会说一种语言的人能够辨别*unsystem和*needlessity这样不可能的词以及disobvious，linguisticism和antiquify这样可能但是不存在的词。,"Speakers can distinguish between impossible words such as *unsystem and *needlessity, and possible but nonexisting words such as curiouser, linguisticism, and antiquify."
9544,这样的辨别能力进一步证明，我们的心理语法中关于词汇形态的组成部分，不仅是一个词库，即一张现有词的清单，同时还包括一些规则，使我们能够创造并理解新词，并分辨可能的词和不可能的词。,"The ability to make this distinction is further evidence that the morphological component of our mental grammar consists of not just a lexicon—a list of existing words—but also of rules that enable us to create and understand new words, and to recognize possible and impossible words."
9545,艾略特实际攻击的是整个中层阶级自由主义的意识状态，即工业资本主义社会的官方统治意识形态。,"What Eliot was in fact assaulting was the whole ideology of middle-class liberalism, the official ruling ideology of industrial capitalist society."
9545,自由主义、浪漫主义、新教主义、经济个人主义——所有这些都是那些遭到有机社会乐园放逐者的反常信条：他们因为别无长物，只能求助于自己那渺小的个人才智。,"Liberalism, Romanticism, protestantism, economic individualism: all of these are the perverted dogmas of those expelled from the happy garden of the organic society, with nothing to fall back on but their own paltryindividual resources."
9545,艾略特自己的解决方法是一种极右的权力主义：人们必须为一个非人的秩序牺牲自己微不足道的“个性”和见解。,Eliot's own solution is an extreme right-wing authoritarianism: men and women must sacrifice their petty 'personalities' and opinions to an impersonal order.
9546,过去时规则也在经历着泛化。,The past-tense rule is also undergoing generalization.
9546,通过类推bake (烤，原型)/baked (烤，过去时)和 ignite (点燃，原型)/ignited (点燃，过去时)，很多成人和儿童开始时都说I waked (而不是使用不规则的过去时形式woke) last night (我昨晚醒了)， She lighted (而没有使用不规则的过去时形式lit) the bonfire (她点着了篝火)。,"By analogy to bake/ baked and ignite/ignited, many children and adults now say I waked last night (instead of woke) and She lighted the bonfire (instead of lit)."
9546,在今天的词典里，这些规则的过去时形式排列在不规则的过去时形式之下，这两种形式目前处于共存阶段。,"These regular past-tense forms are found in today’s dictionaries next to the irregular forms, with which they currently coexist."
9547,类推变化是一种将语言的规则泛化的倾向，也是语言演变的一个主要原因。,"Analogic change refers to a tendency to generalize the rules of language, a major cause of language change."
9547,我们提到过两个实例，复数规则和过去时形成规则的泛化。比如，cow/kine变成了cow/cows；light/lit变成了light/ lighted。,"We mentioned two instances, the gener- alization of the plural rule (cow/kine becoming cow/cows) and the gener- alization of the past-tense formation rule (light/lit becoming light/lighted)."
9548,诚然，任何一位阅读文学理论入门的人都有权希望有一个名词解释，比如什么叫结构主义，什么叫解构主义。,"Still, anyone reading an introductory book on literary theory has a right to expect an explanation of terms such as structuralism and deconstruction."
9548,我在附录部分对主要批评学派或者流派做了一个简要的描述。你可以先读这一部分，或者最后读，或者不时去翻一翻。,"I offer brief sketches of major critical schools or movements in the Appendix, which can be read first or last or referred to constantly."
9548,希望你喜欢这本书！,Enjoy!
9549,但是一个连词是没有主要语的，它跟它的部件是不必相同的。,
9549,,But a conjunction has no head; it is not the same as any of its parts.
9549,假如John碰见Marsha了(If John and Marsha met)它并不是说John met和Marsha met。,"If John and Marsha met, it does not mean that John met and that Marsha met."
9549,假如选民给克林顿和戈尔一个机会，他们不是给戈尔一个机会，又给克林顿一个机会，他们是给整张选票一个机会。,"If voters give Clinton and Gore a chance, they are not giving Gore his own chance, added on to the chance they are giving Clinton; they are giving the entire ticket a chance."
9550,"‘零敲碎打”的一个重要特征是那种明显的从容自如，它能使不文明的，没文化的""零敲碎打者立即毫不困惑地或毫不犹豫地在自己的生活和自然的生活之间建立起满意的相似的关系。","A  significant  feature  of  bricolage  is  clearly  the  ease  with  which  it enables  the  non-civilized,  non-literate  bricoleur  to  establish  satisfactory analogical  relationships  between  his  own  life  and  the  life  of  nature instantaneously  and  without  puzzlement  or  hesitation."
9550,他的‘图腾的”逻辑，不仅已成为结构，而且可以构造结构。例如对神话的运用，就使这种逻辑轻而易举地从一个概念层次进入另一概念层次。,"His  ‘totemic’ logic is not only structured, but structuring: its use of myth enables it to move effortlessly from one conceptual level to another."
9551,辅音还可进一步按调音方式分类。,Consonants are further classified according to their manner of articulation.
9551,可以分为清音或带音、口音或鼻音、长音或短音等。,"They may be voiced or voiceless, oral or nasal, long or short."
9551,也可以分为塞音、擦音、塞擦音、流音或滑音。,"They may be stops, fricatives, affricates, liquids, or glides."
9551,发带音时声带合拢并振动，发清音时声带打开不振动。,"During the production of voiced sounds, the vocal cords are together and vibrating, whereas in voiceless sounds they are apart and not vibrating."
9551,清音可以是送气的或不送气的。,Voiceless sounds may also be aspirated or unaspirated.
9552,上面这些说法会让我们觉得匪夷所思，但是它们每一个的确是科学家在讨论人类拥有语言这个特殊的器官时所提出的论点。,"These arguments might strike us as peculiar, but every one of them has been made by scientists of a different species about a complex organ that that species alone possesses, language."
9552,我们在这一章会看到，乔姆斯基和他最强悍的对手只同意一点:语言本能似乎与达尔文的进化理论不相容。因为进化论是说:一个复杂的生物系统其实是许多世代基因突变累积的结果，因为这些随机的突变，加强了生殖的成功率。,"As we shall see in this chapter, Chomsky and some of his  ercest opponents agree on one thing: that a uniquely human language instinct seems to be incompatible with the modern Daiwinian theory of evolution, in which complex biological systems arise by the gradual accumulation over generations of random genetic mutations that enhance reproductive success."
9553,动词有各种论元结构，描述与特定动词共现的NP。,"Verbs have various argument structures, which describe the NPs that may occur with particular verbs."
9553,举例来说，不及物动词只带一个NP主语，而双及物动词则带一个NP主语，一个NP直接宾语和一个NP间接宾语。,"For example, intransitive verbs take only an NP subject, whereas ditransitive verbs take an NP subject, an NP direct object, and an NP indirect object."
9553,题元角色描述一个动词及其NP论元之间的语义关系。,Thematic roles describe the semantic relations between a verb and its NP arguments.
9553,以下是一些题元角色：施事— 动作的行使者；主位—动作的经受者；还有目标、来源、工具和经历者。,"Some thematic roles are agent: the doer of an action; theme: the recipient of an action; and goal, source, instrument, and experiencer."
9554,事实上，西蒙的进步如此受关注，只是因为他是第一个被语言心理学家注意到的孩子。,"Actually, Simon's achievements are remarkable only because he is the first one who showed them to a psycholinguist."
9554,一定还有成千上万的西蒙没有被注意到。大约95%的聋哑孩子，是诞生在听力正常的家庭中，有幸学到美国手势语言的孩子，多半是因为他们的父母也去学了一些以便与他们沟通。,"There must be thousands of Simons: ninety to ninety-five percent of deaf children are born to hearing parents.Children fortunate enough to be exposed to ASL at all often get it from hearing parents who themselves learned it, incompletely, to communicate with their children."
9554,从LSN到ISN的转变显示，手势语言的确是克里奥化现象的产物。,"Indeed, as the transition from LSN to ISN shows, sign languages themselves are surely products of creolization."
9555,在所有语言的历史中都发生过类似的变化。,Similar changes occur in the history of all languages.
9555,/tʃ/或/ʃ/都不是拉丁语的音位，但/tʃ/是现代意大利语的音位，/ʃ/是现代法语的音位，这两种语言都是从拉丁语演化而来的。,"Neither /tʃ/ nor /ʃ/ were phonemes of Latin, but /tʃ/ is a phoneme of modern Italian and /ʃ/ a phoneme of modern French, both of which descended from Latin."
9555,在美国手语中，很多手势最初都是在腰或胸的高度打出的，而现在则提高到胸的上部与颈部之间，这也体现了一种“音系”上的变化。,
9555,,"In American Sign Language many signs that were originally formed at the waist or chest level are now produced at a higher level near the neck or upper chest, a reflection of changes in the “phonology.”"
9556,有人说柯尔律治的应用批评独立于——甚或幸运地逃离了——他的总体哲学观点以外，这是个错误。,That Coleridge's applied criticism is independent of—or even a happy escape from—his general philosophic principles is an error common to Coleridgeans and to many anti-Coleridgcans as well.
9556,信仰柯尔律治的人也好，许多反对柯尔律治的人也一样，都犯了这个错误。当这种错误认识走向极端时，便得出这样的结论：柯尔律治的批评方法“在今天会被说成是印象主义的”，以及“有如阿那托尔•法郎士的“灵魂在众多杰作中的历险”。就连雷泽，在他责无旁贷地编辑柯尔律治的莎士比亚批评论文时，也犯了错误。他说，柯尔律治在《文学生涯》中分析华兹华斯的学说时，总体思想“是归纳的推谂，是以……个人经验为基础的”，“无论在何种意义上都不是根据某种玄学系统作出的艺术的归纳，不是我们通称为美学的那个哲学分支”。,"At its extreme, this opinion results in the conclusioa that Coleridge's critical method would today be called impressionistic,' and'is something like Anatole France's ""adventures of the soui among masterpieces"" Even T. M. Raysor, in his indispensable edition of Coleridge's Shakespeare criticism, is misleading when he says that in Coleridge's analysis of Wordsworth's theories in the Biographia general ideas ‘are inductive generalizaticms based upon...personal experience,'and‘not in any sense a deduction of art from a meta¬physical system, like that branch of philosophy which we call aesthetics.’"
9557,这种把文学作为美学对象，认为文学可以使我们成为“更完美的人”的观点是和一种主体思想相关的，理论界称这种主体为“自由主体”，即不受社会环境和利益限定，而是由个人主观性（即理性和道德性）制约的自由主体。这种个人主观性的产生，从根本上说是不受社会制约的。,"This view of literature as an aesthetic object that could make us ‘better people’ is linked to a certain idea of the subject, to what theorists have come to call ‘the liberal subject’, the individual defined not by a social situation and interests but by an individual subjectivity (rationality and morality) conceived as essentially free of social determinants."
9557,这种与实用目的脱离、诱导独特的反思与认同的美学对象帮助我们通过自由公正地运用想像能力成为自由主体，这一想象能力可以把理解力和判断力合理地结合在一起。,"The aesthetic object, cut off from practical purposes and inducing particular kinds of reflection and identifications, helps us to become liberal subjects through the free and disinterested exercise of an imaginative faculty that combines knowing and judging in the right relation."
9558,"问题在于，尽管限定词和形容词都是名词的修饰语,它们的地位不同。","The problem is that although determiners and adjectives are both modifiers of the noun, they have a different status."
9558,首先，一个NP所包含的限定词不能超过一个，但包含的形容词可以是多个。,"First, an NP will never have more than one determiner in it, while it may contain many adjectives."
9558,此外，形容词可以直接修饰名词，而限定词 修饰整个“(多个)形容词+名词”的复杂结构。,"Also, an adjective directly modifies the noun, while a determiner modifies the whole adjective(s) + noun complex."
9559,语言是一种艺术，就像酿酒或做点心一样，但是书写应该是更好的明喻。,"As ...one of the founders of the noble science of philology observes, language is an art, like brewing or baking; but writing would have been a better simile."
9559,它当然不是一个美的本能，因为任何一种语言的习得都要经过学习。,"It certainly is not a true instinct, for every language has to be learned."
9559,但是它跟其他的艺术是截然不同的，因为人有喜欢说话的倾向，这点我们从幼儿牙牙学语就可以看得出来。但是没有哪一个孩子有酿酒、烘焙或书写的本能倾向。,"It differs, however, widely from all ordinary arts, for man has an instinctive tendency to speak, as we see in the babble of our young children; while no child has an instinctive tendency to brew, bake, or write."
9559,此外，没有任何一个语言学家现在会说，语言是故意发明出来的。它是逐渐地、不自觉地、经过许多步骤慢慢发展出来的。,"Moreover, no philologist now supposes that any language has been deliberately invented; it has been slowly and unconsciously developed by many steps."
9560,倘若要避免沦为戏谑模仿，扭曲模仿必须既把握住原本的某种精神实质，又效仿它的形式手法，稍加变化（通常在字眼上），这样就造成了原本的逼真性与仿作之间的距离。,"If it is to avoid burlesque, parody must capture something of the spirit of the original as well as imitate its formal devices and produce through slight variation – usually of lexical items – a distance between the vraisemblance of the original and its own."
9560,“我知道这首诗是如何起作用的；请看要揭穿这首诗故作庄重的架势是多么容易；它的效果是可以模仿的，因此是做作；它的成就是一触即碎的，完全依靠了阅读程式才得以支撑住。”这基本上就是扭曲模仿的精神实质。,‘I see how this poem works; look at how easy it is to show up the sententiousness of this poem; its effects are imitable and hence artificial; its achievement is fragile and depends on conventions of reading being taken seriously.’ That is essentially the spirit of parody.
9561,热奈特表示，这一区别其实是无法证明的，因为如果直接模仿能够纯然再现另一个人真正说过的话，那就像一幅荷兰绘画在画布上包含了真实客体，实际上是不可能的。,"Genette shows that the distinction cannot be sustained, since if one could have direct imitation involving a pure representation of what someone actually said, it would be like a Dutch painting in which actual objects were included on the canvas."
9561,他的结论是：“文学再现，即古人的模仿，其实并不是叙述加”言说“（speeches），而是叙述，只是叙述。”,"He concludes: ‘Literary representation, the mimesis of the ancients, is not, therefore, narrative plus “speeches”: it is narrative and only narrative.’"
9562,最终被揭示的是一个结构的模子，它可以被缩减成一个句子，甚至一个词。,"What will ultimately be uncovered is a structural ‘matrix’, which can be reduced to a single sentence or even a single word."
9562,这个模子只能间接地被缩减，并不实际以一个词或一个陈述出现在诗中。,The matrix can be deduced only indirectly and is not actually present as a word or statement in the poem.
9562,诗歌通过这个模子实际的种种表述，即人们熟悉的陈述、套话、引语或习俗的联想等多种形式，与这个模子联系在一起。,"The poem is connected to its matrix by actual versions of the matrix in the form offamiliar statements, clichés, quotations, or conventional associations."
9563,焦点自然集中在叙述的本质上。,"The focus, naturally enough, is on the nature of narrative."
9563,如果说抒情诗以所谓联想的“垂直的”方式（索绪尔语）把“陌生化”过程作用于静态的对象和事物，那么，小说中叙述的头等重要性则把一种适合于在短暂的时间内迅速发挥作用的方式强加给小说，即句段的、“水平的”方式。,"If the lyric operates the process of ‘making strange’ on static objects and institutions in what, to use Saussure’s term, could be called an associative, ‘vertical’ mode, the overriding necessity of narrative in the novel forces on it a mode appropriate to its investment in temporality: the syntagmatic, ‘horizontal’ mode."
9563,因为小说最关心的问题是序列，由于时间的流失持续不断，小说不会提供其他事先存在的具体材料来供陌生化的过程发挥作用。,"Because the novel concerns itself centrally with sequence, with the continuous passage of time, it offers no other pre-existing concrete material on which the process of defamiliarization is able to act."
9564,但是un-并不具有完全的能产性。,Yet un- is not fully productive.
9564,我们可以找到happy (高兴的）和unhappy (不高兴的），cowardly(怯懦的）和uncowardly (不怯懦的），但是sad(悲伤），brave(勇敢）和obvious (明显）没有 对应的*unsad，*unbrave和*unobvious。带星号的形式也许仅仅是词库中偶然的词汇缺位。如果有人说某人*unsad，我们也能明白那个人是“不悲伤”，而一个*unbrave的人就是不勇敢。,"We find happy and unhappy, cowardly and uncowardly, but not sad and *unsad, brave and *unbrave, or obvious and *unobvious."
9564,但是，正如语言学家安珊笛所指出的，“un-规则” 对于从动词派生出来的形容词来说可能最具有能产性，比如unenlightened (未经启蒙的) ，unsimplified (未简化的) ，uncharacterized (不体现特性的)，unauthorized (未经授权的），undistinguished (无特色的）等。,"It appears that the “un-Rule” is most productive for adjectives that are derived from verbs, such as unenlightened, unsimplified, uncharacterized, unauthorized, undistinguished, and so on."
9564,"大部分能够被接受的带un-的词，其词基似乎都是多音节的，而虽然有unfit(不合适的）、uncool (不冷静的）、unclean (不干净的 ） 这样的例子，许多不能被接受的带un-的形式，其词干都是单音节的，例如unbig，ungreat, unred, unsad, unsmall, untall等 。","It also appears that most acceptable un- words have polysyllabic bases, and while we have unfit, uncool, unread, and unclean, many of the unacceptable -un forms have monosyllabic stems such as *unbig, *ungreat, *unred, *unsad, *unsmall, *untall."
9565,诗人和小说家的创作基础是读者的读解能力。,
9565,,Poets and novelists write on the basis of this competence: they write what can be read.
9565,为了读解文学文本，我们必须具有“文学能力”，正如我们为了理解所遇到的普通言语，需要有一般的“语言能力”一样。,"In order to read texts as literature we must possess a ‘literary competence’, just as we need a more general ‘linguistic competence’ to make sense of the ordinary linguistic utterances we encounter."
9565,我们在教育机构中习得这种文学“语法”。,We acquire this ‘grammar’ of literature in educational institutions.
9566,因而，与其说文学理论家、批评家和教师是学说供应者，不如说他们是话语监督人。,"Literary theorists, critics and teachers, then, are not so much purveyors of doctrine as custodians of a discourse."
9566,他们的任务是保存这种话语，必要时扩展和完善它，保护它不受其他话语的侵犯，引导初学者入门，以及确定其是否成功地掌握了这种话语。,"Their task is to preserve this discourse, extend and elaborate it as necessary, defend it from other forms of discourse, initiate newcomers into it and determine whether or not they have successfully mastered it."
9566,这种话语言本能身没有明确的所指，但这并非意味着它没有包括任何假定：相反，它是可以涵括一个完整的意义、客体和实践领域的能指网络。,"The discourse itself has no definite signified, which is not to say that it embodies no assumptions: it is rather a network of signifiers able to envelop a whole field of meanings, objects and practices."
9566,某些作品作为更能经得起这一话语的检验的东西被精选出来，于是这些就以文学或“文学经典”为人所知。,"Certain pieces of writing are selected as being more amenable to this discourse than others, and these are what is known as literature or the 'literary canon'."
9567,像-ify和-cation这样的黏着语素被称为派生语素。,Bound morphemes like -ify and -cation are called derivational morphemes.
9567,把黏着语素加到一个词基上，就会派生出一个有着新语义的新词，把-ify加到pure (纯净）上就形成purify意思是“使纯净纯化”；再把-cation加到上面，就构成一个名词，意思是“纯化过程”。,"When they are added to a base, a new word with a new meaning is derived.The addition of -ify to pure—purify—means “to make pure,” and the addition of -cation—purification—means “the process of making pure.”"
9567,如果我们发明一个形容词pouzy来描写静电对头发产生的效应，你马上就能理解下面这两个句子：“在地毯上走确实pouzified我的头发”，“pouzification的最佳方法就是用气球在你的头上摩擦”。,"If we invent an adjective, pouzy, to describe the effect of static electricity on hair, you will immediately understand the sentences “Walking on that carpet really pouzified my hair” and “The best method of pouzification is to rub a balloon on your head.”"
9568,比如，在孵化后的9到21小时内，小鸭子会跟着见到的第一个移动物体走，不论该物体的样貌或步态是不是像一只鸭子。,"Ducklings, for example, during the period from nine to twenty-one hours after hatching, will follow the first moving object they see, whether or not it looks or waddles like a duck."
9568,此类行为不是有意识决定的结果，也不是外部指导或大量实践的结果。,"Such behavior is not the result of conscious decision, external teaching, or intensive practice."
9568,该行为看来是随着该物种普遍存在的、由发育过程决定的时间表而展开。,It unfolds according to what appears to be a maturationally determined schedule that is universal across the species.
9568,同样的，以后的章节会讨论到，某些鸟类鸣叫能力的发展是在其生物属性决定的固定期限内完成的。,"Similarly, as discussed in a later section, certain species of birds develop their bird song during a biologically determined window of time."
9569,同样，女权主义理论包括的两个支系既拒绝对它的性別功能的绝对正确性进行心理分析，也包括像杰奎琳•罗斯、玛莉·雅各布斯和卡加·西尔弗曼这样的女权主义学者对心理分析作出的杰出阐述。她们认为，只有通过心理分析，掌握了它对内在规范的错综性的认识，才有可能去理解并且再构思妇女的处境。,"Similarly, feminist theory includes both strandsthat reject psychoanalysis for its incontrovertibly sexist foundations and the brilliant rearticulation of psychoanalysis by such feminist scholars as Jacqueline Rose, Mary Jacobus, and Kaja Silverman, for whom it is only through psychoanalysis, with its understanding of the complications of internalizing norms, that one can hope to comprehend and reconceive the predicament of women."
9569,女权主义在它众多的项目中通过拓宽文学的标准和引进一系列新的议题，已经给美国和英国的文学教育带来了根本性的变化。,"In its multiple projects, feminism has effected a substantial transformation of literary education in the United States and Britain, through its expansion of the literary canon and the introduction of a range of new issues."
9570,女性分析是一个有说服力的政治的、文化的、批评的解构形式。,"Gynesis is a potent form of political, cultural and critical deconstruction."
9570,它重新评价和塑造（如果不是爆炸）文学经典，拒绝接受统一的、被普遍认可的意义，公然使话语实践的整个领域政治化。,"It revalues and reshapes (if not explodes) literary canons, refuses unitary or universally accepted meanings, and overtly politicizes the whole domain of discursive practice."
9570,女性分析并不认为“女人”在经验上是可证明的，它认为“女人”是造成主流叙述困扰与不稳定的一个裂隙和缺场。,"Gynesis does not see ‘woman’ as empirically provable: rather, ‘woman’ is a gap or absence that troubles and destabilizes the master narratives."
9571,诺斯特拉语一定是当时狩猎的民族所使用的语言，因为他们在1600个重建的字中没有家畜的名字。,"Nostratic would have been spoken by a hunter­gatherer population, for there are no names of domesticated species among the 1,600 words the linguists claim to have reconstructed."
9571,"他们认为大约在15,000以前，这个诺斯特拉狩猎民族可能是占据了整个欧洲、北非及北方西北、西方及南方的亚洲。它的发源地应该是中东。","The Nostratic hunter-gatherers would have occupied all of Europe, northern Africa, and northern, northeastern, western, and southern Asia, perhaps 15,000 years ago, from an origin in the Middle East."
9572,皮钦语逐渐产生了负面的含义，这或许是因为许多皮钦语都与欧洲殖民帝国有关。,"Pidgin has come to have negative connotations, perhaps because many pidgins were associated with European colonial empires."
9572,《不列颠百科全书》曾把皮钦语描述成“一种不守规则的混杂语，充满了幼稚、粗俗和不标准的用法”。,"The Encyclopedia Britannica once described pidgins as ""an unruly bastard jargon, filled with nursery imbecilities, vulgarisms and corruptions."""
9572,这种定义已经不再使用。,It no longer uses such a definition.
9572,近年来，人们更真切地认识到这样一个事实，即皮钦语反映了人类富有创造性的语言能力，展现出和其他语言一样的创造性特征。,In recent times there is greater recognition that pidgins reflect human creative linguistic ability and show many of the same design properties as other languages.
9573,虽然从表面上看起来，语言区域被一道鸿沟所分隔，这其实是一个假象。,"Though the language areas appear to be separated by large gulfs, this may be an illusion."
9573,大脑皮质（灰质）其实是像一张二度空间的纸被揉成一团以形成一个球状体。,The cerebral cortex (gray matter) is a large sheet of two-dimensional tissue that has been wadded up to fit inside the spherical skull.
9573,正如报纸被揉成一团后上面的图片和文字好像不在一起，其实还是在一起的一样，大脑的侧面就是一副极具误导性的图片，里面各个区域仍然相互连接。,"Just as crumpling a newspaper can appear to scramble the pictures and text, a side view of a brain is a misleading picture of which regions are adjacent."
9574,患有难治型癫痫症的病人，可能会通过切断大脑两半球之间的信息交流来进行治疗，即外科医生切开连接两半球的神经纤维网络—— 胼胝体（见图2.1 )。,"People suffering from intractable epilepsy may be treated by severing communication between their two hemispheres.Surgeons cut through the corpus callosum (see Figure 2.1), the fibrous network that connects the two halves."
9574,当该信息通道被切断后，“两块脑”之间就没有任何信息交流了。,"When this pathway is severed, there is no communication between the “two brains.”"
9574,这种分裂脑患者也为语言的偏侧化提供了证据，并有助于理解人脑的对侧功能。,Such split-brain patients also provide evidence for language lateralization and for understanding contralateral brain functions.
9575,这些作家也都富于想像。例如，平达就曾表明，“那种神圣的冲动会使心灵增高，并发出超越人类的声音”。爱迪生最后认为，自然天才和人为天才的区别好比自然生长的植物和人工修饰的花园中的植物之间的区别：,"They are also subject to inspiration; Pindar,for example, exhibits ‘that divine impulse which raises the mind above itself, and makes the sounds more than human.’ Finally, Addison illustrates the difference between the natural and the artful genius by the difference between the plants in a natural state, and those in a formal garden:"
9576,从理论上说，日语中所有的词和语素都可以用平假名来书写。,"In theory, all of Japanese could be written in hiragana."
9576,"但日语有许多同形异义词，如英语lead pipe(铅管）或lead astray(引入歧途）中的lead,而用日语汉字书写可以消除由这种用音节文字书写而造成的歧义，比如英语中的can在He saw that gasoline can explode (can“罐”：他看到汽油罐爆炸。/can“会”：他明白汽油会爆炸。）这一句子中产生的歧义。","However, in Japanese, there are many homographs (like lead in “lead pipe” or “lead astray”), and the use of kanji disambiguates a word that might be ambiguous if written syllabically, similar to the ambiguity of can in “He saw that gasoline can explode.”"
9577,母语为西班牙语但是能说奇卡诺英语的人可能用西班牙的元音系统代替英语的元音系统。,Chicano speakers whose native language is Spanish may substitute the Spanish vowel system for the English.
9577,这样就产生一些同音词，而这些同音词在SAE中的发音是不同的。,"When this is done, several homonyms result that have distinct pronunciations in SAE."
9577,因此，ship（船）和sheep（羊）的发音都像sheep；rid（摆脱）的发音像read（阅读），等等。,"Thus ship and sheep are both pronounced like sheep; rid is pronounced like read, and so on."
9577,母语为英语但是能说奇卡诺英语的人，尽管掌握了一套完整的美国元音系统的知识，但仍然会选择说奇卡诺英语方言。,Chicano speakers whose native language is English may choose to speak the ChE dialect despite having knowledge of the full set of American English vowels.
9578,可见，在听读时一个字母串或语音串表示的所有意义都会被触发。,"In listening or reading, then, all of the meanings represented by a string of letters and sounds will be triggered."
9578,"这证明自上而下处理的作用 是有限的，因为听见单个的词palm ,对它的处理在某种程度上独立于该词的语境。因此，该词就能启动与其所有词义有关的其他词。","This argues for a limit on the effects of top-down processing because the individual word palm is heard and processed somewhat independently of its context, and so is capable of priming words related to all its lexical meanings."
9578,然而 ，人们会很快（在250毫秒以内）利用句中的消歧信息摒弃那些不适合该句的意义。,"However, the disambiguating information in the sentence is used very quickly (within 250 milliseconds) to discard the meanings that are not appropriate to the sentence."
9578,在前面的例子中，如果我们考察的不是紧接着palm—词后面而是only (仅仅）一词后面的启动，我们会发现启动的词是hand而不再是tree。,"If we check for priming after the word only instead of right after the word palm in the previous example, we find it for hand but no longer for tree."
9579,所以，我们知道[k]和[c]是同一音位的音位变体，擦音[x]和[ç] 也是同一音位的音位变体。,"We therefore conclude that [k] and [c] are allophones of one phoneme, and the fricatives [x] and [ç] are also allophones of one phoneme."
9579,这两对音位变体也满足语音相似性的标准。,The pairs of allophones also fulfill the criterion of phonetic similarity.
9579,"前者都是[-前]塞音，后者都是[-前]擦音 (如果比较[k]和[ç]，以及[c]和[x] ,就会发现没那么相似)。","The first two are [–anterior] stops; the second are [–anterior] fricatives.(This similarity discourages us from pairing [k] with [ç], and [c] with [x], which are less similar to each other.)"
9580,使用外接缀的语言中，人们更为熟悉是德语。,An example of a more familiar circumfixing language is German.
9580,德语规则动词的过去分词，是通过在动词词根加 上前缀ge-和后缀-t构成的。,The past participle of regular verbs is formed by adding the prefix ge- and the suffix -t to the verb root.
9580,给动词词根lieb (爱）加上这样的外接缀，就会生成geliebt (动词“爱”的过去分词，或者用作形容词，意为“心爱的”）。,"This circumfix added to the verb root lieb “love” produces geliebt, “loved” (or “beloved,” when used as an adjective)."
9581,但对我们损害最大的潜意识活动是各种形式的心理障碍。,"Where the unconscious is most damagingly at work, however, is in psychological disturbance of one form or another."
9581,我们的有些潜意识欲望是难以扼制的，但是却又不敢寻找正常的发泄渠道；在这种情况下，欲望竭力要闯出潜意识，自我则防御性地挡住它们，这一内在冲突的结果就是我们所谓的神经官能症。,"We may have certain unconscious desires which will not be denied, but which dare not find practical outlet either; in this situation, the desire forces its way in from the unconscious, the ego blocks it off defensively, and the result of this internal conflict is what we call neurosis."
9581,病人开始出现一些症状，这些症状以一种妥协的方式保护我们免受潜意识欲望的伤害，同时却又含蓄地把这种欲望表现出来。,"The patient begins to develop symptoms which, in compromising fashion, at once protect against the unconscious desire and covertly express it."
9582,在词序较为自由的语言中，比如土耳其语和俄语，语法关系（如主语和宾语）的标记一般是用屈折形态（如格标记）。,"In languages with freer word order, like Turkish and Russian, grammatical relations such as subject and object are generally marked by inflectional morphology, such as case markers."
9582,正在习得这些语言的儿童很快就学会了形态格标记。,Children acquiring these languages quickly learn the morphological case markers.
9582,例如，两岁大学说俄语的儿童能给主语标上主格标记，给宾语标上宾格标记，并且很少出错。,
9582,,"For example, Russian- and German-speaking children mark subjects with nominative case and objects with accusative case with very few errors."
9583,一种语言的描写语法，旨在描写那些在说话者头脑里内化了的规则。,The descriptive grammar of a language attempts to describe the rules internalized by a speaker of that language.
9583,描写语法不同于教学语法，后者是用来学习另一种语言或方言的。,"It is different from a teaching grammar, which is used to learn another language or dialect."
9583,教学语法在学校使用，以便满足语言必修课程的需要。对那些不会说某种标准方言或优势方言，但又觉得学了这种方言会给他们带来社交或经济方面好处的人来说，教学语法会很有帮助。,"Teaching grammars can be helpful to people who do not speak the standard or prestige dialect, but find it would be advantageous socially and economically to do so.They are used in schools in foreign language classes."
9583,教学语法明确地说明语言规则，列出单词及其读音，为学习一种新的语言或方言提供帮助。,"This kind of grammar gives the words and their pronunciations, and explicitly states the rules of the language, especially where they differ from the language of instruction."
9584,当你掌握了一个词或者语素时，你就懂得它的两个方面，即形式(发音)和意义，两者都是语言符号不可或缺的组成部分。,"When you know a word or morpheme, you know both its form (sound or gesture) and its meaning; these are inseparable parts of the linguistic sign."
9584,形式与意义之间的关系具有任意性。,The relationship between form and meaning is arbitrary.
9584,它们之间没有固有的联系(也就是说，学任何一种语言，都必须学习它的词和语素)。,"There is no inherent connection between them (i.e., the words and morphemes of any language must be learned)."
9585,从理论上说，日语中所有的词和语素都可以用平假名来书写。,"In theory, all of Japanese could be written in hiragana."
9585,"但日语有许多同形异义词，如英语lead pipe (铅管）或lead astray (引入歧途）中的lead, 而用日语汉字书写可以消除由这种用音节文字书写而造成的歧义，比如英语中的can在 He saw that gasoline can explode (can“罐 ”：他看到汽油罐爆炸。/can “会 ”：他明白汽油会爆炸。）这一句子中产生的歧义。","However, in Japanese, there are many homographs (like lead in “lead pipe” or “lead astray”), and the use of kanji disambiguates a word that might be ambiguous if written syllabically, similar to the ambiguity of can in “He saw that gasoline can explode.”"
9585,此外，日语汉字已经是日本文化不可分割的一个组成部分。,"In addition, kanji writing is an integral part of Japanese culture, and it is unlikely to be abandoned."
9586,两个语言可能拥有相同的语音音段（音素）但却有不同的音位系统。,Two languages may have the same phonetic segments (phones) but have two different phonemic systems.
9586,从语音上来说，鼻元音和口元音既存在于阿肯语中也存在于英语中。,"Phonetically, both oral and nasalized vowels exist in English and Akan."
9586,但英语没有鼻化元音音位，阿肯语却有。,"However, English does not have nasalized vowel phonemes, but Akan does."
9586,同样的语音音段在两个语言中的功能是不同的。,The same phonetic segments function differently in the two languages.
9586,在英语中，元音的鼻化是冗余的，非区别性的；而在阿肯语中则是非冗余的，区别性的。,Nasalization of vowels in English is redundant and nondistinctive; nasalization of vowels in Akan is nonredundant and distinctive.
9587,辅音还可进一步按调音方式分类。,Consonants are further classified according to their manner of articulation.
9587,可以分为清音或带音、口音或鼻音、长音或短音等。,"They may be voiced or voiceless, oral or nasal, long or short."
9587,也可以分为塞音、擦音、塞擦音、流音或滑音。,"They may be stops, fricatives, affricates, liquids, or glides."
9588,这里的争端疑云丛生，以致我们现在无法说清楚这只是一个经验问题。但是，如果这些争端明确一些，我们就会发现，从中能提出一个经验问题。,"The issues are too clouded for us to be able to say that this is an empirical question, as matters now stand; but when they are sharpened, we may find that an empirical question can be posed."
9588,例如，请考虑在句法部分对删节原理的讨论。,"Consider, for example, the discussion of the erasure principle in syntax."
9588,约瑟夫.埃蒙德提出(在他未发表的著作中），假定可以通过参照61中的底层结构来解释60中的句子——象我所做的那样一一是不正确的。,"Joseph Emonds has suggested (in unpublished work) that it is incorrect to assume, as I did, that the sentences of60 are interpreted through reference to the underlying structures of 61."
9588,相反，他认为，我所说的嵌入命题在由句法部分生成的底层形式中，根本就没有主语；取代罗森堡删节原理的，是一个语义解释的普遍规则。,"Rather, he argues that what I took to be the embedded proposition has no subject at all in the underlying form generated by the syntactic component, and a general rule of semantic interpretation takes the place of Rosenbaum’s erasure principle."
9589,关于艺术的阶级性的理论是一种复杂的理论。,The theory of the class nature of art (klassovost’) is a complex one.
9589,在马克思、恩格斯和前苏联传统的论著中，有两方面得到了强调，一方面是作家的责任感与阶级利益，另一方面是作家作品的社会现实主义。,"In the writings of Marx, Engels and the Soviet tradition, there is a double emphasis – on the writer’s commitment or class interests on the one hand, and the social realism of the writer’s work on the other."
9589,只有那些最粗糙的社会主义现实主义的作品才把艺术的阶级性看作是作家是否忠实于自己的阶级利益这样简单的事。,Only the crudest forms of Socialist Realism treat the class nature of art as a simple matter of the writer’s explicit class allegiance.
9590,哲学语法的明显意图是发展一种心理学的理论，而不是一种解释原文的技术。,"The clear intent of philosophical grammar was to develop a psychological theory, not a technique of textual interpretation."
9590,在它看来，当身体器官产生或感知到具有表层结构的信号时，隐藏在底层的、具有语言形式的抽象组织的深层结构是呈现在心智中的。,"The theory holds that the underlying deep structure, with its abstract organization of linguistic forms, is “present to the mind,” as the signal, with its surface structure, is produced or perceived by the bodily organs."
9590,当说出或理解一个句子时，把深层结构和表层结构联系在一起的转换操作，是由心智完成的实际心理操作。,"And the transformational operations relating deep and surface structure are actual mental operations, performed by the mind when a sentence is produced or understood."
9591,"我认为，这意味着列维-斯特劳斯认为他已取得一种具有""一套转换规则”的分析方法，使我们能够从神话的一种变体转到另一种变体。","This means, I take it, that Lévi-Strauss believes he has arrived at a method of analysis which furnishes ‘rules of transformation’ enabling us to shift from one variant of the myth to another."
9591,"在这种过程中，我们可以看到一种中介的、有效的、“创造出真实”的力量在活动，这股力量可以制伏“残酷的"" 现实并使之转化为自己的意象。","In the process, a mediating, validating, ‘true-making’ agency can be seen to operate which overcomes ‘brute’ reality and transforms it into its own image."
9591,神话就作为这种活动必不可少的“逻辑工具”。通过这种活动，在社会里，我们在前进中不断“弥补”现实，解决事实上不可能解决的“对立”，从而使我们的经验足以证明我们的理论前提，这个前提就是神话思维总是从对立的意识出发，朝着对立的解决而前进。,"Myth emerges as the ‘logical tool’ essential to this operation: one whereby we, in society, ‘make up’ reality as we go along, resolve what are in fact unresolvable ‘oppositions’, and so make our experiences adequate to our theoretical presuppositions: ‘mythical thought always progresses from the awareness of oppositions toward their resolution’."
9592,这种渴望成为中心的欲望在德里达的经典著作《书写学》中被称为“逻各斯中心主义”（Logocentrism）。,This desire for a centre is called ‘logocentrism’ in Derrida’s classic work of Grammatology.
9592,“逻各斯”（Logos，在希腊语中意为“word”[字词]）是新约中表示最伟大、最集中的可能存在的一个词：“太初有言。”（“In the beginning was the Word”）作为世上万物的起源，“逻各斯”（“言”，the Word）为世界的完全在场署了名；人间的每一件事物都是这个原因的结果。,"‘Logos’ (Greek for ‘word’) is a term which in the New Testament carries the greatest possible concentration of presence: ‘In the beginning was the Word.’ Being the origin of all things, the ‘Word’ underwrites the full presence of the world; everything is the effect of this one cause."
9592,尽管《圣经》己经写成，上帝的话也从根本上讲过。,"Even though the Bible is written, God’s word is essentially spoken."
9592,从一个活的机体中说出的字眼比书写的字似乎更接近那个原初的思想。,A spoken word emitted from a living body appears to be closer to an originating thought than a written word.
9593,埃及人也发展了一套图画文字系统，称为圣书字（或象形文字）。,The Egyptians also developed a pictographic system known as hieroglyphics.
9593,这套文字影响了许多民族，包括腓尼基人，他们后来创制了西闪语音节表。,"This system influenced many peoples, including the Phoenicians, who developed the West Semitic Syllabary."
9593,希腊人借用了腓尼基人的文字系统，在根据自己的本族语改造腓尼基文字的过程中，他们用符号来代表辅音和元音，由此发明了第一套字母。,"The Greeks borrowed the Phoenician system, and in adapting it to their own language they used the symbols to represent both consonant and vowel sound segments, thus inventing the first alphabet."
9594,布罗卡失语症和SThe language instinct : how the mind creates language是两个例子，显示语言有缺失，但是其他的智力似乎都没有影响。,Broca's aphasia and SThe language instinct : how the mind creates language are cases where language is impaired and the rest of intelligence seems more or less intact.
9594,但是这并不表示语言是跟智力分家的。,But this does not show that language is separate from intelligence.
9594,或许语言对大脑的要求，远超过其他所有的能力。,Perhaps language imposes greater demands on the brain than any other problem the mind has to solve.
9594,"对别种问题而言，大脑不必全力以赴，但是对语言的要求,大脑必须要100%的投入才行。","For the other problems, the brain can limp along at less than its full capacity; for language, all systems have to be one hundred percent."
9595,以下句子由一个动词、作主语的名词短语以及各种补足语和介词短语构成。,"The following sentences consist of a verb, its noun phrase subject, and various complements and prepositional phrases."
9595,"判断各个名词短语的题元角色，在名词上标注字母a, t, i, s, g, e, 分别代表施事(agent)、主位(theme)、工具(instrument)、来源(source)、目标(goal)、经历者(experiencer)。","Identify the thematic role of each NP by writing the letter a, t, i, s, g, or e above the noun, standing for agent, theme, instrument, source, goal, and experiencer."
9595,例子：The boy(a) took the books(t) from the cupboard,Example: The boy (a) took the books (t) from the cupboard
9595,(s) with a handcart(i).,(s) with a handcart (i).
9596,判断一个句子中是否含有施行动词的一个非正式测试，是在句子前面加上I hereby...(我特此)。,An informal test to see whether a sentence contains a performative verb is to begin it with the words I hereby.
9596,这样开头只有施行句听起来是正确的。,. . . Only performative sentences sound right when begun this way.
9596,对比一下I hereby apologize to you (我特此向你道歉)和有些奇怪的Ihereby know you (我特此认识你)。,Compare I hereby apologize to you with the somewhat strange I hereby know you.
9596,一般认为前一句是一个道歉的行为。,The first is generally taken as an act of apologizing.
9596,在以上所有给出的例子中，插入hereby (特此)都是可以接受的。,"In all of the examples given, insertion of hereby would be acceptable."
9597,形式主义者把注意力从作者引向文字“手段”，声称“手段是文学的唯一英雄”。我们应该向类似于“这首十四行诗怎么了？,"Redirecting attention from authors to verbal ‘devices’, theyclaimed that ‘the device is the only hero of literature’."
9597,”或者“在这本狄更斯所著的书里，什么令人激动的情节降临到小说里？”这样的问题，而不是问“作者在这里说什么？”。这一派的三位重要代表人物是罗曼·雅各布森、鲍里斯·埃钦鲍姆（Boris Eichenhaum)和维克多·什克洛夫斯基（Victor Shklovsky)。,"Instead of asking ‘what does the author say here?’ we should ask something like ‘what happens to the sonnet here?’ or ‘what adventures befall the novel in this book by Dickens?’ Roman Jakobson, Boris Eichenbaum, and Victor Shklovsky are three key figures in this group which reoriented literary study towards questions of form and technique."
9597,这一派把文学研究引向对形式和技巧问题的研究。,
9598,“时间”对于海德格尔来说仍是一个形而上学的范畴，而“历史”对于其它思想家来说在某种意义上却不是。,"Time' for Heidegger is still an essentially metaphysical category, in a way that 'history' for other thinkers is not."
9598,历史是我们实际所做的一切的产物，这就是我所谓的“历史”。,"It is a derivation from what we actually do, which is what I am taking 'history' to mean."
9598,但这种具体的历史几乎与海德格尔全然无关：尽管他的确区别了Historie（历史）和Geschichte（历史）这两种历史——前者大意是“所发生的事”，后者是被体验为真正有意义的“所发生的事”。,"This kind of concrete history concerns Heidegger hardly at all: indeed he distinguishes between Historie, meaning roughly 'what happens', and Geschichte, which is 'what happens' experienced as authentically meaningful."
9599,流行病学研究显示，SThe language instinct : how the mind creates language有家族遗传性。,Epidemiological and familial aggregation studies show that SThe language instinct : how the mind creates language runs in families.
9599,在一个多代同堂的家族里，有一半成员有语言功能障碍。人们对该家族进行了仔细研究。所有研究对象都是以英语为母语的成年人。,"One such study is of a large multigenerational family, half of whom are language impaired."
9599,该家族中语言功能有障碍的成员，都有一个非常独特的语法问题。,The impaired members of this family have a very specific grammatical problem: They do not reliably use word-endings or “irregular” verbs correctly.
9599,他们不会可靠地表达动词的时态。,"In particular, they often fail to indicate the tense of the verb."
9600,“仔细阅读”也是一种值得研究的说法。,Close reading' is also a phrase worth examining.
9600,像“实用批评”一样，它意味着详尽的分析解释，从而为唯美主义的胡说八道提供了可贵的解毒剂；但它似乎也在暗示，先前所有的批评学派平均每行只读两到三字。,"Like 'practical criticism' it meant detailed analytic interpretation, providing a valuable antidote to aestheticist chit-chat; but it also seemed to imply that every previous school of criticism had read only an average of three words per line."
9600,其实，号召仔细阅读不仅仅是强调对本文给予应有的注意。,"To call for close reading, in fact, is to do more than insist on due attentiveness to the text."
9600,它必然使人想到对此物而非他物的注意：对于“书页之上的文字”而不是对于产生和环绕它们的关系结构的注意。,It inescapably suggests an attention to this rather than to something else: to the 'words on the page' rather than to the contexts which produced and surround them.
9601,这种观点来自巴尔特早先的兴趣，即全部人类的事务（例如，食物，服饰）都渗透着编码行为，以及它的作用是人类活动中独一无二的。,"It  derives  from  Barthes’s  earlier interests in the pervasiveness of coding in all human affairs (e.g.food, clothing) and  its  role  as  the  distinctive  human  activity."
9601,这种观点的结论是，我们生活在一个无法向我们提供“纯洁的天真无邪的”语境的世界上。这是一个关于符号的世界，而不是经验的世界。因此，结构主义最终倾向必将是趋向一种适合于分析这种世界的科学。,"We  live  in  a world,  the  argument  concludes,  which  has  no  ‘pure’,  no  ‘innocent’contexts to offer us: a world of signs about, rather than experience of. It follows that structuralism’s final inclination must be towards a science appropriate to the analysis of such a world."
9602,儿童可能要花上好几个月甚至好几年，才能掌握那些为功能语素（如限定词和代词）确立指称关系的各种语用知识。,It may take a child several months or years to master those aspects of pragmatics that involve establishing the reference for function morphemes such as determiners and pronouns.
9602,而儿童习得其他方面的语用知识却很早。,Other aspects of pragmatics are acquired very early.
9602,处在独词语阶段的儿童使用具有不同示意语力的独词语句。,Children in the holophrastic stage use their one-word utterances with different illocutionary force.
9603,双语现象是个令人感兴趣的话题。,Bilingualism is an intriguing topic.
9603,人们想知道一个儿童怎么可能同时习得两种（或多种）语言。,People wonder how it’s possible for a child to acquire two (or more) languages at the same time.
9603,涉及双语现象的问题很多，比如，儿童会弄混这两种语言吗？,"There are many questions, such as: Doesn’t the child confuse the two languages?"
9603,习得双语要比习得单语花更长的时间吗？,Does bilingual language development take longer than monolingual development?
9603,双语儿童更聪明吗？或者，习得两种语言是否对儿童其他方面的认知发展产生负面影响？,"Are bilingual children brighter, or does acquiring two languages negatively affect the child’s cognitive development in some way?"
9603,一个儿童必须接触每种语言到什么程度，才能成为双语者？,How much exposure to each language is necessary for a child to become bilingual?
9604,元音构成音节的韵核。,Vowels form the nucleus of syllables.
9604,元音按舌位的高中低和前央后，以及唇形的圆展来分类。,"They differ according to the position of the tongue and lips: high, mid, or low tongue; front, central, or back of the tongue; rounded or unrounded lips."
9604,英语的元音还可分为紧和松，紧元音稍长于松元音。,The vowels in English may be tense or lax.Tense vowels are slightly longer in duration than lax vowels.
9604,元音还可分为重读的（较长较响较高）和非重读的。,"Vowels may also be stressed (longer, higher in pitch, and louder) or unstressed."
9604,跟辅音一样，元音也可分为口元音和鼻元音，尽管任何语言中的大部分元音都是口元音。,"Vowels, like consonants, may be nasal or oral, although most vowels in all languages are oral."
9605,发带音时声带合拢并振动，发清音时声带打开不振动。,"During the production of voiced sounds, the vocal cords are together and vibrating, whereas in voiceless sounds they are apart and not vibrating."
9605,清音可以是送气的或不送气的。,Voiceless sounds may also be aspirated or unaspirated.
9605,发送气音时除阻后声带还分开一会儿，结果有一股气流冲出。,"In the production of aspirated sounds, the vocal cords remain apart for a brief time after the stop closure is released, resulting in a puff of air at the time of the release."
9605,辅音还可按照某些特征组成更大的类，如唇音、舌冠音、前腔音、咝音等。,"Consonants may be grouped according to certain features to form larger classes such as labials, coronals, anteriors, and sibilants."
9606,这至少意味着在富有经验的“已开化的”头脑中，“野蛮人”希望以图腾方式调和时间的持续前进运动和 “停顿的”、“凝固的”或“无时间的”瞬间的对立使这个愿望再次复活。,"It involves at the very least a resurrection in the sophisticated ‘civilized’ mind of the ‘savage’ desire for a totemic reconciliation of the opposition between the ongoing movement of time, and its ‘stopped’, ‘frozen’ or ‘timeless’ moments."
9606,有意义的是，“文明”的头脑旨在通过“艺术”或”哲学“来达到这种调和，而“野蛮人”的头脑则企图通过神话来达到调和。,"It is signiﬁcant that where the ‘civilized’ mind aims to achieve this reconciliation through ‘art’ or ‘philosophy’, the ‘savage’ mind aims to achieve it through myth."
9606,我们甚至还可以说，就艾略特和苏人的隐蔽的联系而言，高度欧化的艾略特其实是个彻头彻尾的美国人，远远超过他或者我们所想象的。,"And we might even add that, in respect of his covert link with the Sioux, the highly Europeanized Eliot remained nevertheless more American than he, or we, had realized."
9607,关于第二个结论，问题则很简单：对计算机之复杂性和速度的所有量度，并没有说明短语规则是“最简单的可能算法”。,"As to the second point, it is simply untrue that all measures of complexity and speed of computation lead to phrase structure rules as the “simplest possible algorithm.”"
9607,唯一存在的与此间接的结果表明，与上下文无关的短语结构语法（如果我们把词汇条目和深层规则遵循的分布条件排除在外，这种语法对深层结构的规则来说，是一个合理的模型）接受一种理论自动机的解释，这种解释将这种语法看作是非决定论的迭代式存储自动机。但是从“算法的简单性”之类的观点来看，很难说后者是一个“自然的”观念。,"The only existing results that are even indirectly relevant show that context-free phrase structure grammars (a reasonable model for rules generating deep structures, when we exclude the lexical items and the distributional conditions they meet) receive an automata-theoretic interpretation as nondeterministic pushdown storage automata, but the latter is hardly a “natural” notion from the point of view of “simplicity of algorithms” and so forth."
9608,我们已经确定，一个专有名词（比如说“ 杰克”）的意义，就是它所指的一个个体，或者说它的指称。,"We have already determined that the meaning of proper names like Jack is its reference, that link between the word Jack and the person named Jack, which is its referent."
9608,专有名词是名词短 语（NP)，你可以在一个句子中任何一个NP的位置换上专有名词，句子仍然合乎语法。,Proper names are noun phrases (NPs); you can substitute a propername in any NP position in a sentence and preserve grammaticality.
9608,还有其他NP也指称个体。,There are other NPs that refer to individuals as well.
9609,布鲁姆特别关注华兹华斯、雪莱、济慈、丁尼生等人的浪漫主义的“危机诗歌”。,"Bloom pays particular attention to the Romantic ‘crisis-poems’ of Wordsworth, Shelley, Keats and Tennyson."
9609,他们每一位都奋力拼搏，要创造性地误读他们的前人。,Each poet struggles to misread his predecessors creatively.
9609,他们的每一首诗都经历了修正阶段，而每一个阶段都采用了一对修正率。,Each poem passes through the stages of revision and each stage works through the pairs of revisionary ratios.
9609,譬如，雪莱的《西风颂》 就这样奋力与华兹华斯的《永生不朽颂》拼搏：第1-2节用克利纳门/苔莎拉；第4节用克诺西斯/达门奈扎逊；第5节用阿斯克西斯/阿波弗拉迪斯。,"Shelley’s ‘Ode to the West Wind’, for example, struggles with Wordsworth’s ‘Immortality’ ode as follows: stanzas I–II, clinamen/tessera; IV, kenosis/daemonization; V, askesis/apophrades."
9609,要全面把握布鲁姆的这一方法，必须仔细研读《误读之图》的第3部分。,It is necessary to study Part III of A Map of Misreading to grasp the full working of Bloom’s method.
9610,然而，比喻不论新生的还是垂死的，都是所有话语中不可分割的成份，包括那些既非劝说性亦非审美性的，而是描述性或信息性的话语。,"Metaphor, however, whether alive or moribund, is an inseparable element of all discourse, including discourse whose purpose is neither persuasive nor aesthetic, but descriptive and informative."
9610,形而上学的系统尤甚，它在本质上是一个比喻的系统。斯蒂芬·C·佩珀在其近作中论证说，各种主要的世界观都是一个庞大的提喻，即以宇宙整体来喻指一个部分。,"Metaphysical systems in particular are intrinsically metaphorical systems, and, in a recent book, Stephen C Pepper has made out each of the major world views to be a kind of prodigious synecdoche, demonstrating the whole of the universe to be like one of its parts."
9611,天赋假说还预测所有的语言都遵循普遍语法的原则。,The innateness hypothesis also predicts that all languages will conform to the principles of UG.
9611,我们离了解普遍语法原则的全部属性还差得很远。,We are still far from understanding the full nature of the principles of UG.
9611,对更多的语言进行研究，使我们可以验证并列结构限制这类原则。,Research on more languages provides a way to test any principles that linguists propose.
9612,美国人传统上就是逃离文化的人。,Traditionally the American is the man on the run from culture.
9612,当文化研究把文学作为上层精华诋毁时，很难把它与资产阶级平庸主义长期的民族传统区別开。,"When cultural studies denigrates literature as elitist, this is hard to distinguish from a long national tradition of bourgeois philistinism."
9612,在美国，回避高雅文化而研究通俗文化算不上政治的激进，也算不上反抗的姿态，它倒更能称得上是一门大众文化学科。,In the United States shunning high culture and studying popular culture is not a politically radical or resistant gesture so much as a rendering academic of mass culture.
9613,更常见的情况是，通用语用作商用语言。,"More frequently, lingua francas serve as trade languages."
9613,在东非居住着数百个村庄，每个村庄都说他们自己的语言，但这一地区的许多非洲人至少学习了某种斯瓦希里语作为他们的第二语言。几乎在每个市场都使用这种通用语，大家都听得懂。,"East Africa is populated by hundreds of villages, each speaking its own language, but most Africans of this area learn at least some Swahili as a second language, and this lingua franca is used and understood in nearly every marketplace."
9613,尼日利亚也存在类似的情况，豪萨语是那里的通用语。,"A similar situation exists in Nigeria, where Hausa is the lingua franca."
9614,在英语和其他语言中，还有许多别的同化规则的例子。,There are many assimilation rules in English and other languages.
9614,前面说到，英语的规则名词复数后缀，带声的/z/，在清音后面变成/s/，与此类似的，英语的规则动词过去时后缀，带声的/d/，在清音后面变成/t/。,"Recall that the voiced /z/ of the English regular plural suffix is changed to [s] after a voiceless sound, and that similarly the voiced /d/ of the English regular past-tense suffix is changed to [t] after a voiceless sound."
9614,这些都是带音被同化的例子。,These are instances of voicing assimilation.
9615,同音形词意义不同，但发音相同，而拼写则可能相同，也可能不同。,"Homonyms are words that have different meanings but are pronounced the same, and may or may not be spelled the same."
9615,（当拼写相同时，它们是同形异义词，但当同形异义词发音不同时，比如pussy“猫咪”意思是“感染”或“猫”，它们被称为“同义词”，而不是同音异义词。）,"(They’re homographs when spelled the same, but when homographs are pronounced differently like pussy meaning “infected” or pussy meaning “kitten,” they are called heteronyms rather than homonyms.)"
9616,她对莎士比亚十四行诗、威契菜的剧作《乡下妻子》、丁尼生、乔治·爱略特和狄更斯等人作品的研究阐明了这类作品历史化与祛历史化的矛盾倾向。,"Her study of Shakespeare’s Sonnets, Wycherley’s play, The Country Wife, Tennyson, George Eliot and Dickens illustrates the paradoxically historicizing and dehistoricizing tendencies of this kind of work."
9616,此书关于哥特式小说是“恐怖主义和同性恋恐慌”的说法也颇有名。,The book is also notable for its discussion of the Gothic as ‘Terrorism and Homosexual Panic’.
9616,她特别(以弗洛伊德理论为依据)探索了“妄想狂是一种精神病，描画了同性恋恐惧症的机制” 。,"In particular (building on Freud), she explores the theory that ‘paranoia is the psychosis that makes graphic the mechanisms of homophobia’."
9617,此外，一方面，在那些与英国保持密切联系的殖民者身上，可以反映出英国英语的变化;另一方面，英国英语的早期形式则仍被保留在向西拓展的美国人中间，因为他们与大西洋彼岸的交流中断了。,"In addition, the colonists who maintained close contact with England reflected the changes occurring in British English, while earlier forms were preserved among Americans who spread westward and broke communication with the Atlantic coast."
9617,对地域方言的研究产生了方言地图集，采用方言地图标明了话语中具有特殊方言特点的各个地区。,"The study of regional dialects has produced dialect atlases, with dialect maps showing the areas where specific dialect characteristics occur in the speech of the region."
9617,每一个地区用称为同言线的线条标出边界。,A boundary line called an isogloss delineates each area.
9618,这几段文字幽默的基础在于几对不同的同音形词：flower(花（和flour（面粉），还有ground的两个意义。,The confusion and humor is based on the different sets of homonyms: flower and flour and the two meanings of ground.
9618,爱丽丝说的ground意义是grind（磨）的过去时，而白女王则把ground理解成“土地”了。,"Alice means ground as the past tense of grind, whereas the White Queen is interpreting ground to mean “earth.”"
9618,第二段文字则是tale和tail这两个同音形词造成了误会。,
9619,图画文字和表意文字的区别并不总是一清二楚的。,The difference between pictograms and ideograms is not always clear.
9619,表意文字倾向于不太直接地代表所指事物，我们必须通过学习才能明白某个特定表意文字的意义。,"Ideograms tend to be less direct representations, and one may have to learn what a particular ideogram means."
9619,而图画文字则更为直观。,Pictograms tend to be more literal.
9619,例如，由一个黑色圆圈在中间加一条横穿其间的红斜杠组成的“严禁停车”符号，是一个表意文字，它以抽象方式表示“严禁停车”这一概念。,"For example, the no parking symbol consisting of a black letter P inside a red circle with a slanting red line through it is an ideogram.It represents the idea of no parking abstractly."
9619,同一个符号如果由一辆正在被拖走的车辆来表示，就比较直观，更像一幅图画文字。,"A no parking symbol showing an automobile being towed away is more literal, more like a pictogram."
9620,在有外接缀的语言中，词根就是外接缀所包裹的词汇形式。举例来说，奇卡索语ik-chokm-o中的chokm就是词根。,"In languages that have circumfixes, the root is the form around which the circumfix attaches, for example, the Chickasaw root chokm in ikchokmo (“he isn’t good”)."
9620,在有中缀的语言中，词根是指中缀加入其中的词汇形式。比如，邦托克语f-um-ikas中的fikas就是词根。,"In infixing languages the root is the form into which the infix is inserted; for example, fikas in the Bontoc word fumikas (“to be strong”)."
9621,在9世纪和10世纪期间，斯堪的纳维亚入侵者最终在不列颠群岛上定居下来，并在英语中留下了痕迹。,"During the ninth and tenth centuries, Scandinavian raiders, who eventually settled in the British Isles, left their traces in the English language."
9621,代词they(他们，主格），their(他们的，属格）和them(他们，宾格）是外来词，来源于古斯堪的纳维亚语，即现代丹麦语、挪威语和瑞典语的前身。,"The pronounsthey, their, and them are loan words from Old Norse, the predecessor of modern Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish."
9621,英语仅在这段时期从其他语言中借用了代词。,
9621,,This period is the only time that English ever borrowed pronouns.
9622,这里似乎很淸楚，皮尔士的论证完全没有说服力，而且对它本来想取而代之的先定和谐说，也没有什么改进。,"Here,it seems clear that Peirce’s argument is entirely without force and that it offers little improvement over the pre-established harmony that it was presumably intended to replace."
9622,心理是自然法则的产物这一事实，并不意味着心理具有理解这些法则或通过“外展”得出这些法则的能力。,The fact that the mind is a product of natural laws does not imply that it is equipped to understand these laws or to arrive at them by “abduction.”
9622,要设计出一种装置(例如，编写一部计算机程序），一种自然法则的产物，并非难事，但输入数据后，它可能会得出任意荒谬的理论来“解释”这些数据。,"There would be no difficulty in designing a device(say, programing a computer)that is a product of natural laws, but that, given data, will arrive at any arbitrary absurd theory to “explain” these data."
9623,使用委婉语并不是新鲜事。,The use of euphemisms is not new.
9623,据报道希腊历史学家普卢塔克在公元1世纪曾写道，“古代的雅典人……过去曾用吉利、礼貌的术语来掩盖事物的丑陋，给它们以礼貌、讨人喜欢的名字。因此，他们称harlots （妓女）为companions （伴侣），称taxes （纳税）为contributions （捐款），称prison （监狱）为chamber （房间）。”,"It is reported that the Greek historian Plutarch in the first century c.e.wrote that “the ancient Athenians . . . used to cover up the ugliness of things with auspicious and kindly terms, giving them polite and endearing names. Thus they called harlots companions, taxes contributions, and prison a chamber.”"
9624,许多失语症患者并非丧失全部语言功能，而只是不同语言功能的选择性障碍。障碍的类型，一般都与脑损伤的位置有关。,"Most aphasics do not show total language loss.Rather, different aspects of language are selectively impaired, and the kind of impairment is generally related to the location of the brain damage."
9624,由于脑损伤与语言缺陷之间存在着这种关联，所以，对失语症病人的研究为弄清语言在人脑中的组织机制，提供了大量的信息。,"Because of this damage-deficit correlation, research on patients with aphasia has provided a great deal of information about how language is organized in the brain."
9625,琳达· 哈琴对詹姆逊和伊格尔顿的某些观点有不同看法。詹姆逊和伊格尔顿认为，后现代主义的文本间性只是以一种浅薄的、妥协的怀旧形式复制过去，而不是揭示其话语和意识形态中的结构。,Linda Hutcheon disputes the implication she finds in both Jameson and Eagleton that postmodernist intertextuality merely reproduces the past in the form of a shallow and compromised nostalgia rather than revealing its construction in discourse and ideology.
9625,哈琴对此提出了批评，在《后现代主义政治》（1989） 中， 她通过分析伊格尔顿自己的历史小说《圣哲与学者》（1987），批评他“作为一个马克思主义批评家居然指责后现代小说是非历史的”。,"In The Politics of Postmodernism (1989), she replies to Eagleton – ‘a Marxist critic who has accused postmodern fiction of being ahistorical’ – by way of an analysis of his own historical novel, Saints and Scholars (1987)."
9626,文化研究就是探讨我们在多大程度上受文化形式的操纵，以及我们能在多大程度上，或者用哪些方式使文化为其他目的服务，就像人们说的，发挥“能动作用”。,"Cultural studies ask how far we are manipulated by cultural forms and how far or in what ways we are able to use them for other purposes, exercising‘agency’, as it is called."
9626,（“能动作用”是当前理论的简略提法。该问题是关乎我们在多大程度上可以成为对自己行为负责的主体，以及我们貌似自主的选择在多大程度上受制于我们所不能控制的力量的问题。）,"(The question of ‘agency’, to use the shorthand of current theory, is the question of how far we can be subjects responsible for our actions and how far our apparent choices are constrained by forces we do not control.)"
9627,在文艺复兴时期，新兴的中产阶级想要自己的子女说“上层”阶级的方言。,In the Renaissance a new middle class emerged who wanted their children to speak the dialect of the “upper” classes.
9627,这一愿望使得许多规定语法得以出版。,This desire led to the publication of many prescriptive grammars.
9627,1762年，罗伯特•洛思主教写了一部《英语语法简论及评注》。,In 1762 Bishop Robert Lowth wrote A Short Introduction to English Grammar with Critical Notes.
9627,洛思为英语制定了许多新规则，很多规定受到了他个人偏好的影响。,"Lowth prescribed a number of new rules for English, many of them influenced by his personal taste."
9628,在1911年的时候，波亚斯偶然提起爱斯基摩人用4个不相干的字根来说雪。,In 1911 Boas casually mentioned that Eskimos used four unrelated word roots for snow.
9628,沃尔夫数到7个，而且暗示还有更多。,Whorf embellished the count to seven and implied that there were more.
9628,他的文章流传很广，许多教科书都引用到；因此，这个数字就越来越膨胀，最后变成报纸“惊人的事实”的新闻。,"His article was widely reprinted, then cited in textbooks and popular books on language, which led to successively in ated estimates in other textbooks, articles, and newspaper columns of Amazing Facts."
9629,"这些序列约束决定了一个语言中不出现但潜在的词是什么样的,还决定什么样的语音链“不可能”或“不合法”。","These determine what words are possible in a language, and what phonetic strings are impermissible.Possible but nonoccurring words constitute accidental gaps and are nonsense words, e.g."
9629,例如，blick[blik]不是现有的英语单词，但它有可能成为英语单词；而kbli[kbli]或ngos[gos]不可能成为英语单词。,", blick [blɪk]."
9629,"潜在而未出现的词构成了偶然缺位,也是无意义词。",
9630,这则漫画的幽默在于吐司（toast）一词的歧义。作为食物，法国吐司（French toast)是一个物质名词；作为祝辞，它又是个可数名词。,"The humor of the cartoon is based both on the ambiguity of toast and the fact that as a food French toast is a mass noun, but as an oration it is a count noun."
9630,这种可数或物质名词的区别表明说话者知道何种类型的限定词与不同种类的名词搭配的特性。,The count/mass distinction captures the fact that speakers know the prop- erties that govern which determiner types go with different nouns.
9631,不过，我们现在可以认为，马克思只是求助于公认的（黑格尔式的）关于文学艺术的思维方式。,"However, it is now possible to see that Marx was simply falling back on received (Hegelian) ways of thinking about literature and art."
9631,我们在第二章中关于穆卡若夫斯基的讨论现在看来是马克思主义的观点：伟大的文学经典是社会产生的。,Our discussion of Mukarˇovsky ́ in Chapter 2 established what can now be regarded as a Marxist view: that canons of great literature are socially generated.
9631,希腊悲剧的“伟大”不在于它具有普遍的、不变的存在，而在于它具有必须由一代又一代人作出重新阐释的价值。,"The ‘greatness’ of Greek tragedy is not a universal and unchanging fact of existence, but a value which must be reproduced from generation to generation."
9632,"于是,在这种情况下，普通语法原理与独立建立起来的特殊语法规则相结合，就产生出一种特定的、相当惊人的经验结果，即35和36对代词“him”的指称所作的解释，必定是不同的。","In this case, then, a principle of universal grammar combines with an independently established rule of particular English grammar to yield a certain rather surprising empirical consequence, namely that 35 and 36 must differ in the referential interpretation of the pronoun “him.”"
9632,我们再次看到，与例27a和27b所讨论的元音弱化的情形大致相似，要用“习惯”、“倾向”和“类推”对上述情形进行解释，是根本不可能的。,"Once again, as in the formally somewhat analogous case of vowel reduction discussed earlier in connection with examples 27a and 27b, it is quite impossible to provide an explanation in terms of“habits”and“dispositions” and “analogy.”"
9632,毋宁说，我们必须提出某种支配人类心理能力的、在某种程度上是抽象的普遍原理，来解释那些正在讨论的现象。,"Rather, it seems that certain abstract and in part universal principlesgoverning human mental faculties must be postulated to explain the phenomena in question."
9633,第一种符号是“图像”的，描写了词与物之间“自然的”对应，它总结了索绪尔之前的老语言观，即词与物表现出一种具有普遍意义的自然的统一性。,"The first sign is ‘iconic’, describing the ‘natural’ correspondence between word and thing, and it sums up the old pre-Saussurean notion of language, according to which words and things appear naturally unified in a universal meaning."
9633,第二种图摧毁了词与物之间古老的和谐：“女”与“男”作为能指标在了可辨识的门上。,The second diagram destroys the old harmony: the signifiers ‘ladies’ and ‘gentlemen’ are attached to identical doors.
9633,“同样的”门被置于不同的语言系统中，这样就让我们把它们看作“不同的”了。,"The ‘same’ doors are made to enter the differential system of language, so that we are made to see them as ‘different’."
9634,在停止讨论俄狄浦斯情结的问题之前，应该强调指出：这一问题是弗洛伊德工作中最核心的部分。,"Before leaving the question of the Oedipus complex, its utter centrality to Freud's work should be emphasized."
9634,它并非只是另一情结：它是一个使我们成为现在这样的男人和女人的关系结构。,It is not just another complex: it is the structure of relations by which we come to be the men and women that we are.
9634,它是我们作为主体得以产生和构成的关键所在。对于我们来说，问题在于，它在某种意义上总是偏颇的和有缺陷的机制。,"It is the point at which we are produced and constituted as subjects; and one problem for us is that it is always in some sense a partial, defective mechanism."
9634,它标志着从快乐原则转向现实原则；从封闭的家庭转向广阔的社会，因为我们从乱伦转向超家庭关系；从自然转向文化，因为我们可以把幼儿与母亲的关系在某种意义上视为“自然关系”，而把在俄狄浦斯阶段之后的儿童视为正处于在整个文化秩序中采取某种立场这一过程之中的人。,"It signals the transition from the pleasure principle to the reality principle; from the enclosure of the family to society at large, since we turn from incest to extra-familialrelations; and from Nature to Culture, since we can see the infant's relation to the mother as somehow 'natural', and the post-Oedipal child as one who is in the process of assuming a position within the cultural order as a whole."
9635,这并不否认艺术的主要形式对“外在的”不变的世界负有直接的固定的义务。,This is not to deny that major modes of art will appear to involve an apparently straightforward and stable commitment to an unchanging world ‘beyond’ themselves.
9635,一本书总是象一个窗口，从那里可以清楚地看到这个世界。,A book of a certain kind will always appear as a window through which such a world is clearly visible.
9635,书中，能指似乎总是直接地、明确无误地指向所指。但是正如我们看到的，结构主义和符号学的主旨是，即使在那些作品的目的完全是现实主义的事例中（如巴尔扎克的侦探小说《萨拉西纳》)，写作的这种“透明性”，文学的这种“单纯性”仍不过是幻想。,"In it, the signiﬁers appear to point directly and conﬁdently to the signiﬁeds.But a central tenet of structuralism and semiotics is, as we have seen, that even in cases where the aim of the work is utter realism (the detective novel, Balzac’s Sarrasine), this ‘transparency’ of writing, this ‘innocence’ of literature, remains an illusion."
9636,然而另一方面，正像托马舍夫斯基支出的那样，我们一旦接受了某种新的程式，就会变得习惯起来，对它的所有荒诞性和不可能性视而不见，听而不闻。,"On the other hand, as Tomashevsky pointed out, we become accustomed to all kinds of absurdities and improbabilities once we learn to accept a new set of conventions."
9636,在冒险故事中，英雄被恶棍杀害之前总会通过某种方式获得解救，而我们总是分辨不出那些完全不可能的方式来。,We fail to notice the improbable way in which heroes are always rescued just before they are about to be killed by the villains in adventure stories.
9636,的确，现实主义的核心策略就是掩饰其人为的虚构性，假装在作品与作品展示给我们的现实之间没有艺术可言，就此而论，它与“直白其形式技巧”的做法恰恰相反。,"Indeed, realism’s central strategy is to disguise its artiﬁciality, to pretend there is no art between it and the reality it shows us; in this respect, it does the exact opposite of ‘baring its device’."
9637,在英文里，名词短语（NP）是由名词（N）前面加一个冠词或限定词（略写为det），与任何数目的形容词（A）所组成的。,"In English a noun phrase (NP) is composed of a noun (N), sometimes preceded by an article or ""determiner"" (abbreviated ""det"") and any number of adjectives (A)."
9637,"在语言学上箭头表示由什么组成, 括弧表示可用可不用，星号表示随便你要用几次。我讲这些符号的意思是说，上面这些讯息只要用几个符号就可很正确地表达出来了。","In the standard notation of linguistics, an arrow means ""consists of,"" parentheses mean ""optional,"" and an asterisk means ""as many of them as you want,"" but I provide the rule just to show that all of its information can be captured precisely in a few symbols."
9638,对于维多利亚时代的统治阶级来说，这是非常令人担忧的，因为从任何理由来说，宗教都是一种极其有效的意识形态控制方式。,"This was particularly worrying for the Victorian ruling class, because religion is for all kinds of reasons an extremely effective form of ideological control."
9638,像一切成功的意识形态一样，宗教活动依靠的主要不是明确的概念或系统的学说，而是意象、象征、习惯、仪式和神话。,"Like all successful ideologies, it works much less by explicit concepts or formulated doctrines than by image, symbol, habit, ritual and mythology."
9638,它是情绪的和经验的，因而能使自己与人类主体的最深的潜意识之根缠结在一起；任何一种社会意识形态，如果它不能与这种深刻的、非理性的恐惧和需要相契合——就艾略特(T.S.Eliot) 所了解的那样——它就不可能长存久在。,"It is affective and experiential, entwining itself with the deepest unconscious roots of the human subject; and any social ideology which is unable to engage with such deepseated a-rational fears and needs, as T. S. Eliot knew, is unlikely to survive very long."
9639,早期形式主义学派以象征主义为基础，他们和象征主义者一样把形式视为有效的交流工具，形式是自主的；自我表达的，能够借助词外的韵律、联想和含蓄等手段“伸展”语言，使其超出规范的“日常的”意义范围。,"Early Formalism built on the groundwork of symbolism, and of the symbolist concern with form as a viable communicative instrument; autonomous, self-expressive, able by extra-verbal rhythmic, associative and connotative means to ‘stretch’ language beyond its normal ‘everyday’ range of meaning."
9639,这些问题导致了文学批评首先关心的是文学语言得以发生作用的技巧，并且还要注意把这些技巧同“普通”语言的模式加以分离和区别。,"These concerns engendered in criticism a preoccupation with the techniques by which literary language works, and a concern to specify and diﬀerentiate these from the modes of ‘ordinary’ language."
9639,但是正如埃辛鲍姆写的那样，形式主义学派“向象征主义者开战，从他们手中夺回了诗学，使诗学从他们主观的哲学和美学理论中解放出来，并使诗学朝着科学地研究事实的方向发展”。,"But, as Eichenbaum wrote, the formalists ‘entered the ﬁght against the symbolists in order to wrest poetics from their hands to free it from its ties with their subjective philosophical and aesthetic theories, and to direct it towards the scientiﬁc investigation of facts’."
9640,楔形文字的传播遍及中东和小亚细亚。,The cuneiform writing system spread throughout the Middle East and Asia Minor.
9640,巴比伦人、亚述人和波斯人都借用了楔形文字。,"The Babylonians, Assyrians, and Persians borrowed it."
9640,在采纳楔形文字语符的过程中，借用者常用它们来表达本族语中语词音节的读音。,"In adopting cuneiform characters, the borrowers often used them to represent the sounds of the syllables in their own languages."
9640,楔形文字就以这种方式演化成为一种音节文字系统。,In this way cuneiform evolved into a syllabic writing system.
9641,也有人提出过有关语法上的性是否影响说话者对事物的思考这一问题。,The question has also been raised regarding the possible influence of grammatical gender on how people think about objects.
9641,许多语言都把名词分为阳性和阴性（如西班牙语、德语）；在西班牙语中，la Have (钥匙）是阴性名词，而el puente(桥）是阳性名词。,"Many languages, such as Spanish and German, classify nouns as masculine or feminine; Spanish “key” is la llave (feminine) and “bridge”is el puente (masculine)."
9641,有些心理学家指出，对性加以区别的语言的使用者把事物看成像人或动物那样具有性别。,"Some psychologists have suggested that speakers of gender-marking languages think about objects as having gender, much like people or animals have."
9641,有一项研究要求说德语和西班牙语的人用英语形容词来描写各种物体（这些人熟练掌握英语）。,"In one study, speakers of German and Spanish were asked to describe various objects using English adjectives(the speakers were proficient in English)."
9642,因此，结构主义者的最终目标是永恒的结构：个人的行为、感觉和姿态都纳入其中，并由此得到它们最终的本质。,"It follows that the ultimate quarry of structuralist thinking will be the permanent structures into which individual human acts, perceptions, stances ﬁt, and from which they derive their ﬁnal nature."
9642,最后就象F •詹姆森所描绘的那样，是“明确地寻找心灵本身的永恒的结构，寻找心灵赖以体验世界的，或把本身没有意义的东西组成具有意义的东西所需要的那种组织类别和形式”。,"This will ﬁnally involve what Fredric Jameson has described as ‘an explicit search for the permanent structures of the mind itself, the organizational categories and forms through which the mind is able to experience the world, or to organize a meaning in what is essentially in itself meaningless’."
9642,显然，维柯的幽灵还没有得到安慰。,The ghost of Vico clearly remains unplacated.
9643,翻译不仅仅是语词之间一对一的替换。,Translation is more than word-for-word replacement.
9643,常常出现的情况是，在目的语中没有对应的词，词序也可能不同，比如把英语这样的主一动一宾（SVO)语言翻译成日语那样的主一宾一动(SOV)语言就是这样。,"Often there is no equivalent word in the target language, and the order of words may differ, as in translating from an SVO language like English to an SOV language like Japanese."
9643,另外，翻译习语、隐喻、行话等等时也会有困难。,"There is also difficulty in translating idioms, metaphors, jargon, and so on."
9643,人工翻译，这些问题都能处理好，因为翻译人员知道两种语言的语法，并且能够利用对所谈内容和世界的综合了解来表达原文所想要表达的意义。,Human translators cope with these problems because they know the grammars of the two languages and draw on general knowledge of the subject matter and the world to arrive at the intended meaning.
9644,雅各布森在交流行为本质和语言功能方面的相关工作已在前文有所提及。,"Jakobson’s work on the nature of the communicative act, and on the functions of  the  language  involved  has  already  been  mentioned."
9644,他关于“诗歌的功能”的阐述具有特别的意义。,His account of the ‘poetic function’ has been of particular significance.
9644,它证实了上面已经提到的那些见解，并在文学的领域里，为形式主义和结构主义的最终结合提供了理论基础。,"It confirms the insights already mentioned, and supplies the theoretical basis for the final stage of the bridge which links Formalism and Structuralism in respect of literature."
9645,对于这个给定的结构，还能进一步应用形态规则。,Further morphological rules can be applied to the given structure.
9645,"举例来说，英语有一个派生后缀-al，出现在egotistical, fantastical和astronomical这样的词中。","For example, English has a derivational suffix -al, as in egotistical, fantastical, and astronomical."
9645,在以上这些例子中，-al附加到形容词egotistic (自我中心的），fantastic (绝妙的），astronomic (天文学的）上，形成一个新的形容词。,"In these cases, -al is added to an adjective—egotistic, fantastic, astronomic—to form a new adjective."
9646,儿童不必学每个词的复数形式，每个词的过去时态，每种所有格形式和每个动词的词尾变化。,"The young child doesn’t need to learn each plural, each past tense, each possessive form, and each verb ending, on a noun-by-noun or verb-by-verb basis."
9646,只要学会一条规则，就能知道成千上万的词形变化。,"Once the rule is learned,thousands of word forms are automatically known."
9646,"在第八章讨论语言的发展的时候，我们还会看见，有很清楚的证据说明，儿童在学习形态音位规则（例如复数规则）的时候，会把这些规则用过了头，结果产生类似mouses, mans等在成人语言中被认为是不正常的形式。","And as we will see when we discuss language development in chapter 8, children give clear evidence of learning morphophonemic rules such as the plural rules by applying the rule too broadly and producing forms such as mouses, mans, and so on, which are ungrammatical in the adult language."
9647,我们的语言“代表”客体：所有语言在某种意义上都是“隐喻”，它以它自身替代对于客体本身的某种无言的直接占有。,"Our language 'stands in' for objects: all language is in a way 'metaphorical', in that it substitutes itself for some direct, wordless possession of the object itself."
9647,在斯威夫特的笔下，拉普顿岛的居民随身背着一个大口袋，装满他们交谈时可能需要的所有物体，并把这些物体直接拿给别人看，作为他们的谈话方式。,"It saves us from the inconvenience of Swift's Laputans, who carry on their back a sack full of all the objects they might need in conversation, and simply hold these objects up to each other as a way of talking."
9647,语言能使我们免除这种不便，在儿童无意识地在语言领域中学习这些课程的同时，他也无意识地从性的世界里学习他们的课程。,"But just as the child is unconsciously learning these lessons in the sphere of language, it is also unconsciously learning them in the world of sexuality."
9648,各种人的谈论——医生的、神职人员的、小说家的、心理学家的、伦理学家的、社会福利工作人员的、政治家的，等等——我们把这些谈论与压制性行为的理念联系在一起。事实上，正是在这些谈论中才出现了我们称为“性”的东西。,"All the sorts of talk – by doctors, clergy, novelists, psychologists, moralists, social workers, politicians – that we link with the idea of the repression of sexuality were in fact ways of bringing into being the thing we call ‘sex’."
9648,福柯写道：关于“性”的概念，以一种人为的统一把解剖学中的不同组成部分、生理功能、行为、情感、欲望的满足等聚合在一起，而且使你能把这种虚构的统一看作一种根本的原因，一种无处不在的意义，一种处处皆有的、有待破译的秘密。,"Foucault writes, ‘The notion of “sex” made it possible to group together, in an artificial unity, anatomical elements, biological functions, conducts, sensations, pleasures; and it enabled one to make use of this fictitious unity as a causal principle, an omnipresent meaning, a secret to be discovered everywhere.’"
9649,多利莫尔特别讨论了这一点，他以洞见发掘了权力与快乐的复杂纠合关系：“快乐与权力不互相取消，也不互相抵梧。”他在《性的异议》（1991）中写道，“它们相互追求，相互搭接，相互加强。它们被复杂的机制、激动与刺激的手段链接起来”。这样，多利莫尔就有效地将男同性恋理论回归到弗洛伊德的“多形态的性反常”概念上——即儿童在成长为减缩的生殖器官的性之前享受多样的性的理论。,"In developing this insight, Jonathan Dollimore, in particular, has explored the complex involvement of power with pleasure: ‘pleasure and power do not cancel or turn back against one another’, he writes in Sexual Dissidence (1991), ‘they seek out, overlap, and reinforce one another. They are linked together by complex mechanisms and devices of excitation and incitement.’ In this way, Dollimore has effectively returned gay theory to Freud’s concept of ‘polymorphous perversity’ – the theory that the child enjoys multiple sexualities before it moves to the reductive primacy of genital sex."
9650,不论何时，一个新学科诞生后，它必须建立自己足够的语言，来研究自己领域的对象。,Whenever a new discipline arises it must establish the adequacy of its own language to the objects in its field of study.
9650,但是，这不是由逻辑的争论来完成的，而是由一个“比逻辑的更修辞的前修辞运动”来完成的。,"However, this is done not by logical argument but by a ‘pre-figurative move that is more tropical than logical’."
9650,当历史学家爬梳整理他们的研究资料时，他们会不声不响地运用肯尼思·博克（Kenneth Burke）所谓的“四大主要修辞格”（即隐喻、换喻、提喻和反讽）来处理它。,"When historians order the material of their study, they render it manageable by the silent application of what Kenneth Burke called the ‘Four Master Tropes’: metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche, and irony."
9651,确定动机是故事要求的，不可缺少的；而“自由”动机从故事的角度看则无关大局，可有可无。,"A bound motif is one which is required by the story, while a ‘free’ motif is inessential from the point of view of the story."
9651,然而从文学的角度看，“自由”动机却很可能是艺术的焦点。,"However, from the literary point of view, the ‘free’ motifs are potentially the focus of art."
9651,譬如，让拉斐尔叙述天国战争的技巧就是一个“自由”动机，因为它并不是故事本身的部分。,"For example, the device of having Raphael relate the War in Heaven is a ‘free’ motif, because it is not part of the story in question."
9651,可是从形式上说，它比战争本身的叙述更为重要，因为，它可以让弥尔顿把这段叙述艺术地插入他整个的情节中。,"However, it is formally more important than the narration of the War itself, because it enables Milton to insert the narration artistically into his overll plot."
9652,这个问题的全部意义也许在V·I·普洛普的著作中得到最精辟的阐述。普洛普的《民间故事的形态研究》至今仍是形式主义学派的重大贡献之一，它向适合于小说艺术的“诗学”迈出了一大步。,"The full implications of this problem were perhaps best handled in the work of V. I. Propp, whose Morphology of the Folktale remains one of the major formalist contributions, and represents a further signiﬁcant step towards a ‘poetics’ appropriate to the art of ﬁction."
9652,事实上，普洛普所关注的恰好是叙述结构得以发挥作用的“标准”，它所要处理的那些内容的单位。他试图对这些加以分类的做法至今仍然有很高的结构价值，因为，就如神话一样，童话是任何叙述的重要原型。,"Propp’s concern, in fact, is exactly with the ‘norms’ by which narrative structures work, the units of ‘content’ in which they seem to deal, and his attempt at a taxonomy of these retains considerable structural value to the present day, for, like the myth, the fairy tale ranks as an important prototype of all narrative."
9653,有时候，叙述接受者就是作品中的一个人物。,Sometimes the narratee is an important character.
9653,譬如，《天方夜谭》中叙述者山鲁佐德（或译谢赫拉查德）之所以能够存在，完全取决于叙述接受者国王哈里发对她持续的注意；假如他对她讲的故事失去了兴趣，她就得死。,"For example, in A Thousand and One Nights the very survival of the narrator, Scheherazade, depends on the continued attention of the narratee, the caliph; if he loses interest in her stories, she must die."
9653,普林斯详尽的理论旨在彰显叙述的各个层面，读者可以直觉地理解叙述中的这些层面，但她们仍旧显得朦胧，因而需要界定。,The effect of Prince’s elaborated theory is to highlight a dimension of narration which had been understood intuitively by readers but which had remained shadowy and undefined.
9654,结构主义者没有把主题作为一个单独的考察对象进行研究。,Structuralists have not made theme a separate object of investigation.
9654,其原因也许很简单，因为主题并不是一组具体的语言成分的必然结果，相反，它只是对我们从文本中发现的连贯一致的形式的命名，或对我们成功地将各种代码联系在一起、并呈现出条理的方法的命名。,The reason may be quite simply that theme is not the result of a specific set of elements but rather the name we give to the forms of unity which we can discern in the text or to the ways we succeed in making various codes come together and cohere.
9654,正如格莱麦和列维-斯特劳斯的模式所清楚表明的，选择行为代码的最终结构是主题，因此不妨说，情节无非是主题结构的顺时性投射。,
9654,,"The ultimate structures of the proairetic code, as Greimas and Lévi-Strauss’s model makes clear, are thematic, and we could say that plot is but the temporal projection of thematic structures."
9655,我们再次看到，与在例27a和27b中所讨论的元音弱化的情形形式上大致相似，要用“习惯”、“倾向”和“类推”对上述情形进行解释，是根本不可能的。,"Once again, as in the formally somewhat analogous case of vowel reduction discussed earlier in connection with examples 27a and 27b, it is quite impossible to provide an explanation in terms of “habits” and “dispositions” and “analogy.”"
9655,毋宁说，我们必须提出某种支配人类心理能力的、在某种程度上是抽象的普遍原理，来解释那些正在讨论的现象。,"Rather, it seems that certain abstract and in part universal principles governing human mental faculties must be postulated to explain the phenomena in question."
9655,如果循环应用原理的确是一种决定人类语言知识形式的规则原理，那么，一个已经掌握了支配英语中代词化的特殊规则的人，无需训练或额外证据，就能直觉地认识到例35和例36在刚才所提到的那方面的不同之处。,"If the principle of cyclic application is indeed a regulative principle determining the form of knowledge of language for humans, a person who has learned the particular rules governing pronominalization in English would know, intuitively and without instruction or additional evidence, that 35 and 36 differ in the respect just noted."
9656,他认为，按照历史只能出现在意识中这一假设，马克思主义就挖空了历史的物质性，而将总体化的叙述填充在由此形成的空白中。,"In its assumption that history is available to consciousness, Marxism is seen as emptying history of its materiality, ﬁlling the void thus created with a totalizing narrative."
9656,在他看来，话语意识淹没了以欲望为核心的图像世界（这个观点与上面第7章中德路兹和瓜塔里的理论十分接近，可参阅）。,Discursive consciousness is seen as submerging the ﬁgural world and its associated nexus of desire (in a theory close to that of Deleuze and Guattari: see Chapter 7).
9656,这种压抑正是“现代”的标志，也是理性推演过程和那些说明现代性特征的正义、文明模式产生的结果。,"This repression represents the mark of the ‘modern’, consequent upon the procedures of rationality and associated with the models of justice and civilization which characterize modernity."
9657,卢梭一再把写作界定为只是一种补充，是一种可有可无的附加，甚至是一种“言语不健全”的现象：写作是由可能导至误解的符号组成的。因为它是人们在说话人不在场的情况下解读的，而说话人又不能对那些符号做出解释和纠正。,"Rousseau repeatedly characterizes writing as a mere addition, an inessential extra, even ‘a disease of speech’: writing consists of signs that introduce the possibility of misunderstanding since they are read in the absence of thespeaker, who is not there to explain or correct."
9657,不过，虽然卢梭称写作是可有可无的附加.但实际上他在自己的著作中还是把写作作为使言语完整，或者弥补言语中的不足的手段的，他总是不断地用写作弥补言语中出现的疏忽，比如能会造成误解的疏漏等。,"But though Rousseau calls writing an inessential extra, his works in fact treat it as what completes or makes up for something lacking in speech: writing is repeatedly brought in to compensate for the flaws in speech, such as the possibility of misunderstanding."
9658,我们可以把述行语言和述愿语言之间所谓的“创造的矛盾”（aporia)做如下解释：创造性的矛盾就是一种无法判定的、摇摆不定的“僵局”，就像到底是鸡生蛋，还是蛋生鸡一样。,"An ‘aporia’ is the ‘impasse’ of an undecidable oscillation, as when the chicken depends upon the egg but the egg depends on the chicken."
9658,要声明语言以其述行功能僵造世界的唯一方法是通过述愿言语，就像“语言塑造世界”这句话一样；但是从另一方面 讲，除了言语行为也没有别的方法声明述愿语的可推断性。执行声明行为的那些陈述必然要声称绝对如实展现事情真 相。,"The only way to claim that language functions performatively to shape the world is through a constative utterance, such as ‘Language shapes the world’; but contrariwise, there is no way to claim the constative transparency of language except by a speech act."
9658,然而，如果你要证实另一面——声明如实再现的事实其实是把它们的范畴强加给了世界——那么你除了声明何为真实，何为不真实的情况之外也别无他法。,The propositions which perform the act of stating necessarily claim to do nothing but merely display things as they are; yet if you want to show the contrary– that claims to represent things as they are in fact impose their categories on the world – you have no way to do this except through claims about what is or is not the case.
9659,支持人类天生就有文法设计蓝图的这个说法的证据，来自对婴儿的研究。,"Evidence corroborating the claim that the mind contains blueprints for grammatical rules comes, once again, out of the mouths of babies and suckings."
9659,以英文句子He walks为保持一致性而添加的字尾变化-s为例。,"Take the English agreement suffix -s as in ""He walks""."
9659,这个一致性在许多语言中都是一个重要的处理过程，但是在现代的英语中，它是多余的，是过去古英语丰富系统所留下的残余物。,"Agreement is an important process in many languages, but in modern English it is superfluous, a remnant of a richer system that flourished in Old English."
9659,假如它完全消失我们也不会怀念它，就像我们不会怀念Thou sayest中的字尾变化-est一样。,"If it were to disappear entirely, we would not miss it, any more than we miss the similar -est suffix in ""Thou sayest""."
9660,失聪婴儿发出的咿呀语听上去不同于有听觉的婴儿。,Deaf infants produce babbling sounds that are different from those of hearing children.
9660,可见咿呀语跟听觉输入有关，而且具有语言的性质。,Babbling is related to auditory input and is linguistic in nature.
9660,"对正常儿童的口头咿呀语和失聪儿童的咿呀手势的比较研究，支持""咿呀语是一种跟儿童获得的那种语言输入相关的语言能力”这一观点。",Studies of vocal babbling of hearing children and manual babbling of deaf children support the view that babbling is a linguistic ability related to the kind of language input the child receives.
9661,"动词不仅能决定一个句子中论元的数量, 还可以限制其主语和补足语的语义特征。","The verb not only determines the number of arguments in a sentence, but it also limits the semantic properties of both its subject and its complements."
9661,例如，find和sleep要求(s-选择)有生主语。,"For example, find and sleep require (s-select) animate subjects."
9661,那个著名的例句colorless green ideas sleep foriously之所以在语义上是异常的，是因为“思想” (不论是否有颜色）不是有生的。,The well-known colorless green ideas sleep furiously is semantically anomalous because ideas (colorless or not) are not animate.
9661,一个动词的语义成分也关系到它能选择怎样的补足语。,Components of a verb’s meaning can also be relevant to the choice of complements it can take.
9662,在卷帙浩繁的黑格尔传统的阐释游戏中，每一位读者都竭力达到理解领悟其他一切的最外圈，然而这种阐释活动本身却未包括在内。于是，我们这里所谈的这一层次上的逼真性，至少在现时条件下，便处于一个十分优越的地位，因为它有执掌并转化其他层次的能力。,"In the great Hegelian game of interpretation, where each reader strives to attain the outermost circle that comprehends all else but is not itself comprehended, this level of vraisemblance enjoys, at least at our moment in history, a privileged status because of its ability to assume and transform other levels."
9662,但是，它充其量又只不过是一种形式的程式性归化，它试图组织起这个规划过程，使之超越意识形态和惯例习俗，而且，如第十章将要论证的，超越整个观念的范畴。,"But it is none the less a mode of conventional naturalization, and attempts to organize it so that it would lie beyond ideology and convention take us, as chapter 10 will argue, beyond the bounds of sense altogether."
9663,长短、音高、响度、重音是韵律或超音段特征，附加于音节中语音的音段值之上。,"Length, pitch, loudness, and stress are prosodic, or suprasegmental, features.They are imposed over and above the segmental values of the sounds in a syllable."
9663,在很多语言的音节中，元音的音高具有语言学意义。,"In many languages, the pitch of the vowel in the syllable is linguistically significant."
9663,例如，两个词的音段都一样，但如果一个高调，一个低调，意义就可能不一样。,"For example, two words with identical segments may contrast in meaning if one has a high pitch and another a low pitch."
9663,这样的语言叫声调语言。,Such languages aretone languages.
9664,不管说什么话，每个人说话时音高总在变动。,Speakers of all languages vary the pitch of their voices when they talk.
9664,音高对于音节的影响在不同语言中有所不同。,The effect of pitch on a syllable differs from language to language.
9664,英语中说cat这个词，不管用高调还是低调都没关系，意思总是指“猫”。,"In English, it doesn’t matter whether you say cat with a high pitch or a low pitch.It will still mean “cat.”"
9664,但在尼日利亚的努佩语中，你如果用高调说ba，意思是“酸”，如果低调，就成了“算”。,"But if you say [ba] with a high pitch in Nupe (a language spoken in Nigeria), it will mean “to be sour,” whereas if you say [ba] with a low pitch, it will mean “to count.”"
9664,那些在元音或音节上用音高区别词义的语言叫声调语言。,Languages that use the pitch of individual vowels or syllables to contrast meanings of words are called tone languages.
9665,一些词是因为故意错用逆构词法才新造出来的。,Some word creation comes from deliberately miscast back-formations.
9665,bikini (比基尼泳装，三点式）一词是一个单语素的名祖，因马绍尔群岛的比基尼环礁而得名。,The word bikini comes from the Bikini atoll of the Marshall Islands.
9665,由于第一个音节bi-(比）在bicycle (自行车）这样的词中意为“两或双”，于是一些聪明人就将无上装的“一点式” 泳装称为monokini。,"Because the first syllable bi- is a morpheme meaning “two” in words like bicycle, some clever person called a topless bathing suit a monokini."
9666,与此相对应，在英国，哈兹里特在谈论诗歌时说:“它是语言的音乐，与心灵的音乐相合……音乐与深藏的激情之间有着密切的联系。人疯了就会唱歌。”,"Correspondingly, in England, Hazlitt said of poetry: ‘It is the music of language, answering to the music of the mind…There is a near connection between music and deep-rooted passion. Mad people sing.’"
9667,有了这些关于语言中音型的事实，就可以把音位定义成处于互补分布的，语音上相似的音的集合。,"Given these facts about the patterning of sounds in a language, a phoneme can be defined as a set of phonetically similar sounds that are in complementary distribution."
9667,一个这样的集合可能只有一个元素。,
9667,所以有些音位仅用一个音表达，它们只有一种音位变体。,Some phonemes are represented by only one sound; they have one allophone.
9667,当集合中存在不止一个音位变体的时候，这些音素听上去应该相似，也就是说，共享绝大部分的语音特征。,"When there is more than one allophone in the set, the phones must be phonetically similar; that is, share most phonetic features."
9668,正如我们所见，音位配列限制说明了哪些语音序列可以在某种语言中出现，因此在英语中blick是一个潜在词，但lbick不是。,"As we saw, phonotactic constraints specify which sound sequences are permissible in a particular language, so that in English blick is a possible word but *lbick isn’t."
9668,很多音系学家相信音系规则的存在保证了表层，或词汇的语音形式不会违反音位配列限制。,Many linguists believe that phonological rules exist to ensure that the surface or phonetic forms of words do not violate phonotactic constraints.
9668,如果底层形式维持不变，常会违反该语言的音位配列学。,"If underlying forms remained unmodified, they would often violate the phonotactics of the language."
9669,现在我们知道，在汉语、泰语以及阿肯语这样的声调语言中，音高是一个音位特征。,"We can now see that pitch is a phonemic feature in tone languages such as Chinese, Thai, and Akan."
9669,我们将这些相对音高称为区别性声调。,We refer to these relative pitches as contrasting tones.
9669,在英语那种语调语言中，表现为短语或句子的音高曲拱或语调的音高依然起着重要作用。,"In intonation languages such as English, pitch still plays an important role, but in the form of the pitch contour or intonation of the phrase or sentence."
9670,在 12世纪，一位冰岛学者为当时的冰岛语文字设计了一套源自拉丁字母的正字法。,"In the twelfth century, an Icelandic scholar developed an orthography derived from the Latin alphabet for the writing of the Icelandic language of his day."
9670,同时代的其他学者对正字法改革也颇感兴趣，但当时唯有这位冰岛人为他的正字法原则留下了记录，他被称为“第一位语法学家”（因为他的那篇未署名论文是当时一部语法论文集的首篇)。,"Other scholars in this period were also interested in orthographic reform, but the Ice-lander, who came to be known as “the First Grammarian” (because his anonymous paper was the first entry in a collection of grammatical essays), was the only one of the time who left a record of his principles."
9670,他所发明的正字法显然是根据音位原则来设计的。,The orthography he developed was clearly based on the phonemic principle.
9671,音系规则的变化能够造成、并且常常确实造成了方言的差异。,"Changes in phonological rules can, and often do, result in dialect differences."
9671,在前一章中我们讨论了英语中增加了“r-删略”规则（除非/r/后面紧接着一个元音，否则/r/不发音)，这条规则并未在英语中普遍开来。,In the previous chapter we discussed the addition of an r-dropping rule in English (/r/ is not pronounced unless followed by a vowel) that did not spread throughout the language.
9671,目前只在英国英语和美国英语的东北以及南方方言中存在r不发音的现象，由此我们可以看到这一规则的影响。,"Today, we see the effect of that rule in the r-less pronunciation of British English and of American English dialects spoken in the northeastern and the southern United States."
9672,在某些语言中，从音位上区别单词也可以用韵律即超音段特征，如音高、重音以及音段的长度或音长。,"Words in some languages may also be phonemically distinguished by prosodic or suprasegmental features, such as pitch, stress, and segment length."
9672,有的语言用音高造成音节或词的对立，这种语言叫声调语言。,Languages in which syllables or words are contrasted by pitch are called tone languages.
9672,其余的叫语调语言，它是用短语或句子上的音高变化来分辨意义差别。,Intonation languages may use pitch variations to distinguish meanings of phrases and sentences.
9673,在柯尔律治的有机论中，感觉的意象成了仅仅供大脑加工的素材——这些素材在与新的整体同化的过程中完全失去了原有的面貌。,"In Coleridge's organic theory, images of sense become merely materials on which the mind feeds—materials which quite lose their identity in being assimilated to a new whole."
9673,“从第一个或初始的观念中，就像从种子中一样，萌发出连续的观念。”,"‘From the first, or initiative Idea, as from a seed, successive Ideas germinate.’"
9674,在有机论美学逐步形成的过程中，夏夫茨伯里公爵第三也起了重要作用，但这不是说他提出了什么合适的原则，而是因为他对德国作家产生了巨大影响（的性质）。,"In the development toward an organic aesthetics the third Earl of Shaftesbury was also important, but more by the nature of his great influence on German writers than by his proper doctrine."
9674,他说，真正的诗人是“第二个造物主”。“他就像至高无上的艺术家或是普遍的有形成力的自然，造就了一个整体，这个整体本身是联贯的、比例得当的，它的组成部分也有着一定的从属性和受支配性。,"The true poet, he said, is ‘a second Maker.’ Like that sovereign artist or universal plastic nature, he forms a whole, coherent and proportioned in itself, with due subjection and subordinacy of constituent parts."
9674,”,’
9675,这问题有一部分是来自从录音带到文件，中间我们说话的抑扬顿挫、语调，及短语交错的时间性都失去了。除非是高真实度的录音带，不然是很不可靠的。,"Part of the problem comes from the circumstances of transcription: the intonation and timing that delineate phrases is lost, and a tran­scription from anything but the highest-fidelity tape is unreliable."
9675,"白宫自己的转录文件可读性就比较高了，他把I want the uh, uh to go 写成 I want them, uh, uh，to go。","Indeed, in the White House's independent transcription of this low­-quality recording, many puzzling passages are rendered more sensibly.For example, I want the, uh, uh, to go is transcribed as I want them, uh, uh, to go."
9676,当一个词同时属于几个不同的句法范畴时，语法分析程序可能会遇到麻烦。,Parsers may run into difficulties with words that belong to several syntactic categories.
9676,比如，在The little orange rabbit hopped (这个橙色小兔跳过去了)这样一个句子中，语法分析程序就可能误把orange(橙色的)当作名词。,"In a sentence like The little orange rabbit hopped, the parser might mistakenly assume orange is a noun."
9676,随后，当错误凸现出来时，分析程序会返回来尝试将orange判定为形容词。,"Later, when the error is apparent, the parser backtracks to the decision point, and retries with orange as an adjective."
9677,在我看来，所谓人类语言学已经推翻了普遍语法假设的信念，在两个重要方面是很虚妄的。,The belief that anthropological linguistics has demolished the assumptions of universal grammar seems to me to be quite false in two important respects.
9677,首先，这个信念误解了古典唯理主义的语法观点。古典唯理主义语法认为，不同的语言只是在较深的层次上——在语法关系得到表达、语言运用的创造性得以实现的层次上——才是相同的；其次，这种信念严重误解了人类语言学的发现。事实上，人类语言学几乎完全把自己局限在语言结构的表层。,"First,it misinterprets the views of classical rationalist grammar, which held that languages are similar only at the deeper level, the level at which grammatical relations are expressed and at which the processes that provide for the creative aspect of language use are to be found.Second, this belief seriously misinterprets the findings of anthropological linguistics, which has, in fact, restricted itself almost completely to fairly superficial aspects of language structure."
9678,英语中还有两组语素变体，它们是所有格语素和第三人称单数语素，拼写为s或es。,"Two further allomorphs in English are the possessive morpheme and the thirdperson singular morpheme, spelled s or es."
9678,这两组语素按照和复数语素规则相同的规则变化。,These morphemes take on the same phonetic form as the plural morpheme according to the same rules!
9678,在ship的后面加上s就可以得到ship's; 在woman的后面加上z就可以得到woman's; 在judge的后面加上əz则得到judge's。,Add [s] to ship to get ship’s; add [z] to woman to get woman’s; and add [əz] to judge to get judge’s.
9679,儿童能够如此快速、省力地习得语言，就是因为他们无须弄懂自己语言中的全部规则，只需要弄懂那些他们那种具体的语言所特有的规则就可以了。,"Children acquire language as quickly and effortlessly as they do because they do not have to figure out all the grammatical rules, only those that are specific to their particular language."
9679,语言的普遍属性一一语言的法则——是他们生理禀赋的一部分。,The universal properties—the laws of language—are part of their biological endowment.
9679,语言理论旨在揭示那些刻画所有人类语言共性的原理，并且展示使得语言习得成为可能的天赋语言机制。,Linguistic theory aims to uncover those principles that characterize all human languages and to reveal the innate component of language that makes language acquisition possible.
9679,在第八章我们将详细讨论语言习得的问题。,In chapter 8 we will discuss language acquisition in more detail.
9680,另外，有些儿童拥有良好的语言技能，但却几乎没有或只有极其有限的交际技能，比如，患有严重功能性孤独症的儿童。对这些儿童的研究表明，认为语言能力只是交际能力发展的结果的任何观念，或者认为语言能力发展的目的只是服务于交际功能的任何观念，都是错误的。,"In addition, any notion that linguistic competence results simply from communicative abilities, or develops to serve communicative functions, is belied by studies of children with good linguistic skills, but nearly no or severely limited communicative skills."
9680,语言的习得和运用所依赖的认知能力，与在社会语境中进行交际的能力似乎是不同的。,The acquisition and use of language seem to depend on cognitive skills different from the ability to communicate in a social setting.
9681,然而叙述不单单是一个学术科目。,But narrative is not just an academic subject.
9681,听故事和讲故事是一种人类的基本欲望。,There is a basic human drive to hear and tell stories.
9681,儿童从很小就练就了可以称之为基本叙述能力的本领：他们要听故事，如果故事还没有结束，你就企图骗他们停下来.他们是不会上当的。,"Children very early develop what one might call a basic narrative competence: demanding stories, they know when you are trying to cheat by stopping before reaching the end."
9681,"因此，叙述理论的第一个问题或许应该是，我们对故事的基本形态究竟掌握哪些隐性知识？这些知识使我们能够区分出哪些故事结束得“恰当”，哪些结束得不恰当,事情还悬而未决。","So the first question for the theory of narrative might be, what do we implicitly know about the basic shape of stories that enables us to distinguish between a story that ends‘properly’ and one that doesn’t, where things are left hanging?"
9681,那么也许就可以这样理解叙述理论：它尝试把叙述能力讲清楚、说明白，就像语言学努力要把语言能力解释清楚一样：讲一种语言的人在认识这种语言时，其潜意识已经知道了些什么。,"The theory of narrative might, then, be conceived as an attempt to spell out, to make explicit, this narrative competence, just as linguistics is an attempt to make explicit linguistic competence: what speakers of a language unconsciously know in knowing a language."
9681,这样，叙述理论也可以被视为对一种直觉文化知识或理解的阐释。,Theory here can be conceived as a setting forth of an intuitive cultural knowledge or understanding.
9682,据说南美洲土著语皮拉罕语里没有2以上的数字，也没有不同的词来表示颜色。,The South American indigenous language Pirahã is said to lack numbers beyond two and distinct words for colors.
9682,请对该语言作一研究。可以从Google搜索入手，看看皮拉罕语是否支持语言决定论或语言相对论。,Research this language—Google would be a good start—with regard to whether Pirahã supports or fails to support linguistic determinism and/or linguistic relativism.
9683,这种柏拉图主义的因素贯透了洪堡特的整个思想。对他来说，提出一种柏拉图式的“学习”理论，就象卢梭依据人类自由的概念对压迫人的社会制度进行批判一样的自然，——这种人类自由的概念严格说来之 于笛卡尔哲学关于机械论解释之限度的假设。,"This Platonistic element in Humboldt’s thought is a pervasive one; for Humboldt, it was as natural to propose an essentially Platonistic theory of “learning” as it was for Rousseau to found his critique of repressive social institutions on a conception of human freedom that derives from strictly Cartesian assumptions regarding the limitations of mechanical explanation."
9683,概言之，把浪漫主义时期的心理学和语言学理解为主要是唯理主义概念的结果，似乎是合适的。,And in general it seems appropriate to construe both the psychology and the linguistics of the romantic period as in large part a natural outgrowth of rationalist conceptions.
9684,语言透过孩子而不朽。,Languages are perpetuated by the children who learn them.
9684,当语言学家看到一个语言只有大人在用时，他知道这个语言己经去日无多了。,"When linguists see a language spoken only by adults, they know it is doomed."
9684,因为这个原因，他们对人类历史即将来临的悲剧提出了警告。,"By this reasoning, they warn of an impending tragedy in the history of humankind."
9685,理解一个句子涉及许多层次上的分析。,Understanding a sentence involves analysis at many levels.
9685,首先我们必须理解听到的单个语音。,"To begin with, we must comprehend the individual speech sounds we hear."
9685,我们意识不到自己用来理解言语的复杂处理过程，正如我们意识不到消化食物和利用食物中的营养成分的复杂过程。,We are not conscious of the complicated processes we use to understand speech any more than we are conscious of the complicated processes of digesting food and utilizing nutrients.
9685,我们必须慎重、科学地研究这些过程。,We must study these processes deliberately and scientifically.
9685,语言运用的首要问题之一涉及声学信号的切分。,One of the first questions of linguistic performance concerns segmentation of the acoustic signal.
9685,了解一些信号的知识会有助于理解这个过程。,"To understand this process, some knowledge of the signal can be helpful."
9686,自20世纪70年代以来，有两个著名的自然语言处理系统是利用谓词一主目方法来进行语义表征的。,Two well-known natural language processing systems have used the predicate-argument approach to semantic representation.
9686,一个被其开发者特瑞•维诺格拉德称为“喜儿德路”（SHRDLU)，它展示出了多种能力，比如能够理解问题，进行推理，学习新词，甚至解释其行为。,"One, named SHRDLU by its developer Terry Winograd, demonstrated several abilities, such as being able to interpret questions, draw inferences, learn new words, and even explain its actions."
9686,它在由一个“积木世界”构成的语境中运行，在这个“积木世界”中有一张桌子，形状、尺寸和颜色多种多样的积木，一个用来移动积木的自动机械臂。,"It operated in the context of a “blocks world,” consisting of a table, blocks of various shapes, sizes, and colors, and a robot arm for moving theblocks."
9687,语义特征无法直接观察到，其存在必须从语言证据中推知。,Semantic properties are not directly observable.Their existence must be inferred from linguistic evidence.
9687,其中一个证据的来源就是我们每个人都会犯的言语错误，亦即“言语错误”或“口误”。,"One source of such evidence is the speech errors, or “slips of the tongue,” that we all produce."
9687,考虑下面说话者实际说出来的一些口误，他们无意中用一些词代替了原本想说的词。,Consider the following unintentional word substitutions that some speakers have actually spoken.
9688,"许多实验研究表明, 儿童对各种语言属性 (如重音和音位配例限制) 以及对输入的统计规律都很敏感, 这使他们能够将听到的流利的言语分割成单词。","Many experimental studies show that children are sensitive to various linguistic properties such as stress and phonotactic constraints, and to statistical regularities of the input that enable them to segment the fluent speech that they hear into words."
9688,语音分割的一种方法是韵律引导。,One method of segmenting speech is prosodic bootstrapping.
9688,"其他的引导方法可以帮助孩子学习基于句法语境 (句法引导) 的动词意义, 或基于词义 (语义引导) 和分布证据的句法类别。","Other bootstrapping methods can help the child to learn verb meaning based on syntactic context (syntactic bootstrapping), or syntactic categories based on word meaning (semantic bootstrapping) and distributional evidence."
9689,词句的音位表征和语音表征(这些词句的发音)之间的关系是由音系规则决定的。,The relationship between phonemic representation and phonetic representation (pronunciation) is determined by phonological rules.
9689,音系规则作用于音位链，使之发生各种变化，派生出语音表征。在手势语中，就会派生出手形。,"Phonological rules apply to phonemic strings and alter them in various ways to derive their phonetic representation, or in the case of signed languages, their hand configuration."
9690,从第六章语音学讨论中我们知道，[ s ]和 [ z ]的唯一差别是带声性；[ s ]不带声，[ z ]带声。就是这个语音特征区别了 seal和 zeal。,"From the discussion of phonetics in chapter 6, we know that [s] and [z] differ in voicing: [s] is voiceless and [z] is voiced.The phonetic feature of voicing therefore distinguishes the two words."
9690,这个特征还能区别feel (感觉) 和 veal (小牛肉) [t]/[v]，以及cap (帽子) 和 cab (车厢) [p]/[b]。,Voicing also distinguishes feel and veal [f]/[v] and cap and cab [p]/[b].
9690,"如果一个特征能区别开两个音位，从而区分开两个词,它就是区别特征(即音位特征)。","When a feature distinguishes one phoneme from another, hence one word from another, it is a distinctive feature or, equivalently, a phonemic feature."
9691,有了IPA音标，我们可以无歧义地表示发音了。,"Using the IPA symbols, we can now unambiguously represent the pronunciation of words."
9691,"例如，在下面六个词里，字母ou表示六个不同的元音，gh除了在rough里读[f],其他都不发音；th表示两个音，而would中的l是哑字母。","For example, in the six words below, ou represents six distinct vowel sounds; the gh is silent in all but rough, where it is pronounced [f]; the th represents a single sound, either [Ð] or [ð], and the l in would is also silent."
9691,用音标来进行语音转写则告诉了我们实际的发音。,"However, the phonetic transcription gives us the actual pronunciation."
9692,"让我们回到英语、德语和瑞典语，我们发现，“人”这个词在三种语言里分别是 man [msn],Mann [m an]和man [man]。","Restricting ourselves to English, German, and Swedish, we find the word for “man” is man [mæn], Mann [man], and man [man], respectively."
9692,在很多对应的词表中，我们都 能看到三种语言之间分别有[m]-[m]-[m]和 [n]-[n]-[n] 的规则语音对应，而这只是其中一个例子。,This is one of many word sets in which we can observe the regular sound correspondence [m]-[m]-[m] and [n]-[n]-[n] in the three languages.
9692,在这些证据的基础之上，比较法使得我们可以在原始日耳曼语中为“人”这个词构拟 *mVn 的形式。,"Based on this evidence, the comparative method has us reconstruct *mVn as the word for “man” in Proto-Germanic."
9692,V表示元音，其特征我们还不确定，因为尽管拼写相似，但是在不同的日耳曼语中，元音的发音却不同，如果没有更多的证据，我们也不清楚如何对它进行构拟。,"The V indicates a vowel whose quality we are unsure of because, despite the similar spelling, the vowel is phonetically different in the various Germanic languages, and it is unclear how to reconstruct it without further evidence."
9693,历史比较语言学家利用文字记录研究语言，这是一项富于挑战性的工作。但是这远不如试图在没有文字历史的语言中寻找谱系关系那么困难。,"The historical comparativists working on languages with written records have a challenging job, but not nearly as challenging as that of scholars who are attempting to discover genetic relationships among languages with no written history."
9693,语言学家首先必须转写各类语言的大量数据，从音系、形态和句法上对这些数据进行分析，并为谱系关系建立基础，如并非由偶然或借用因素导致的基本词汇的相似性以及语音对应关系。然后 ，才能运用比较法构拟已经灭绝的原始语。,"Linguists must first transcribe large amounts of language data from all the languages; analyze them phonologically, morphologically, and syntactically;  and establish a basis for relatedness such as similarities in basic vocabulary and regular sound correspondences not resulting from chance or borrowing.Only then can the comparative method be applied to reconstruct the extinctprotolanguage."
9694,图6.5中的元音没包括所有讲英语的人所拥有的元音。,The vowels in Figure 6.5 do not represent all the vowels of all English speakers.
9694,你可能有些特定的元音没表达在图中。,They may not represent your particular vowel set.
9694,很多讲英国英语的人有一个图中没有的后低圆唇元音，例 如 hot—词中的元音。,"If you speak British English, there’s a good chance that you have a low, back, rounded vowel in the word hot that the vowel chart lacks."
9694,还有很多英国人发的紧元音有很重的复元音倾向，比美国人厉害得多，如gate发成[gejt]，go发成[gow]。,Canadian English speakers pronounce the vowel in words like bite as [ʌɪ] rather than [aɪ].
9694,与此相对的是讲英语的爱尔兰人，他们都发成单元音。,
9695,“读者”这个术语可以进一步分为“隐含读者”与“实际读者”。,The term ‘reader’ can be subdivided into ‘implied reader’ and ‘actual reader’.
9695,“隐含读者”是文本为自己创造的读者，它是一个激励回应的结构网，引导我们以某种方式阅读。,The first is the reader whom the text creates for itself and amounts to ‘a network of response-inviting structures’ which predispose us to read in certain ways.
9695,“实际读者”在阅读过程中接受某些心理意象；但是，这些意象不可避免地会被读者“现存的经验储备”赋予某些色彩。,"The ‘actual reader’ receives certain mental images in the process of reading; however, the images will inevitably be coloured by the reader’s ‘existing stock of experience’."
9695,例如上面提到的华兹华斯那首诗，倘若我们是无神论者，而不是基督徒，那我们会受到的影响就会完全不同。,If we are atheists we will be affected differently by the Wordsworth poem above (p. 47) than if we are Christians.
9695,阅读的经验会根据我们过去的经验而有所不同。,The experience of reading will differ according to our past experiences.
9696,当我们把作诗的技法、韵律和节奏的格式也归入考察之列时，就会发现，它们对确定的“意义”的范围同样做出了贡献。其方式既受外部的常规支配，也受内部的由诗歌本身激起的愿望所支配。,"When the devices of versiﬁcation, patterns of rhyme and rhythm are also considered, it becomes clear that they too contribute inextricably to the range of ‘meanings’ available, in ways that are determined both externally, by convention, and internally, by the expectations aroused by the poem itself."
9696,因此诗歌中所运用的全部“技法”生成并因此也构成了诗歌的“意义”范围。,Thus the sum total of ‘devices’ employed in the poem generate and so constitute its range of ‘meaning’.
9696,最后，诗歌就成为自己的技法，诗歌就是自已的形式。,"In the end, the poem is its devices, and it is its form."
9697,"现在这个问題在于把evolved from转换成very evolved不是从一个动词的主动转成被动,这个跟Andre beat Boris转成被动的Boris was beaten by Andre是不一样的。","The problem is that the conversion of “evolved from” to “very  evolved” is not a switch from the active voice of a verb to the passive voice, as  Andre beat Boris → Boris was beaten by Andre."
9697,塞费尔所提的来源evolved from在现代英语中是不及物的动词，没有直接的受词。,"The source Safire mentions, “evolved from”, is intransitive in modern English, with no direct object."
9697,在英文中要把一个动词变为被动，你要把受词先转为主语，所以is evolved只有在Something evolved Andre的情况下才可能转为被动式，但是这个句子不存在。,"To passivize a verb in English you convert the direct object into a subject, so “is evolved” could only have been passivized from “Something evolved Andre”, which does not exist."
9698,在现代英语里，只有很基本的格系统。通常主动词后紧接的名词短语为直接宾语，因此如果形成疑问句时，需要将主动词提前，那么前后两个规则就会相互矛盾。,"Modern English, with its rudimentary case system, defines grammatical relations structurally: the direct object is the NP that is sister to the verb."
9698,引入do之后可以让主动词保持在原来的位置上，因此保证了句子的SVO词序，因而清楚地显示出句子的主语和宾语。,"If the main verb were to move, this sisterhood configuration would be violated.The introduction of do allows the verb to remain in its base position, and the sentence thus retains the SVO word order that most plainly indicates the subject and object of the sentence."
9699,除此之外，结构主义是这样一系列文学理论之一，他们想以某种有效的东西取代宗教：在结构主义这里，是以科学这一现代宗教。这是注定失败的尝试。,"Structuralism is among other things one more of literary theory's series of doomed attempts to replace religion with something as effective: in this case, with the modern religion of science."
9699,但是，追求文学的纯客观阅读显然造成了严重的问题。,But the search for a purely objective reading of literary works clearly poses grievous problems.
9699,因为，即使在最严格的客观分析中，似乎也不可能根除某些解释因素以及主观性因素。,"It seems impossible to eradicate some element of interpretation, and so of subjectivity, from even the most rigorously objective analysis."
9700,吉尼的话语中缺乏助动词、冠词、第三人称单数的一致性标记、过去时标记和大部分代词。,"Genie’s utterances lacked articles, auxiliary verbs like will or can, the thirdperson singular agreement marker -s, the past-tense marker -ed, question words like who, what, and where, and pronouns."
9700,她不能构造类型更为复杂的句子，比如主语和动词位置互换的疑问句（例如：Are you hungry?,"She had no ability to form more complex types of sentences such as questions (e.g., Are you feeling hungry?"
9700,“你饿了吗”)。吉尼是在关键期过后才开始学习语言的，因此不能完全习得英语的语法规则。,).Genie started learning language after the critical period and was therefore never able to fully acquire the grammatical rules of English.
9701,我认为，这意味着列维-斯特劳斯认为他已取得一种具有“一套转换规则”的分析方法，使我们能够从神话的一种变体转到另一种变体。,"This means, I take it, that Lévi-Strauss believes he has arrived at a method of analysis which furnishes ‘rules of transformation’ enabling us to shift from one variant of the myth to another."
9701,在这种过程中，我们可以看到一种中介的、有效的、“创造出真实”的力量在活动，这股力量可以制服“残酷的”现实并使之转化为自己的意象。,"In the process, a mediating, validating, ‘true-making’ agency can be seen to operate which overcomes ‘brute’ reality and transforms it into its own image."
9701,神话就作为这种活动的必不可少的“逻辑工具”。通过这种活动，在社会里，我们在前进中不断“弥补”现实，解决事实上不可能解决的“对立”，从而使我们的经验足以证明我们的理论前提，这个前提就是神话思维总是从对立的意识出发，朝着对立的解决而前进。,"Myth emerges as the ‘logical tool’ essential to this operation: one whereby we, in society, ‘make up’ reality as we go along, resolve what are in fact unresolvable ‘oppositions’, and so make our experiences adequate to our theoretical presuppositions: ‘mythical thought always progresses from the awareness of oppositions toward their resolution’."
9702,当某个工程师要去建立一个组合字的系统时，他第一个想到的就是字串机器。,"When an engineer has to build a system to combine words in particular orders, a word-chain device is the first thing that comes to mind."
9702,打电话到査号台所听到的语音录音就是一个很好的例子。,The recorded voice that gives you a phone number when you dial directory assistance is a good example.
9702,它是用人的声音去录下十个数字的念音，在7个不同的位置(如电话号码第一个位置时的声调，同样数字在电话号码第二个位置的声调等等)的各种抑扬顿挫声调。,"A human speaker is recorded uttering the ten digits, each in seven different sing-song patterns (one for the first position in a phone number, one for the second position, and so on)."
9703,而更为重要的是，只有当读者凭借现行的阐释手段，以处理这种阅读方法所发现的任何结论时，字谜才能被用于产生意义。,"Moreover, and this is the important point, anagrams can be used to produce meaning only if one relies on current interpretive techniques for dealing with whatever this mode of reading discovers."
9703,当读者发现马拉美的诗题Brise marine（海风）中有一个rire（笑）的字谜时，他可以说道一番，因为他知道这个词语如果真地在诗中出现，应该如何处理。,On finding an anagram of rire in Mallarmé’s title Brise marine one can make something of it because one knows what one might do if the word itself appeared in the poem.
9703,如果在阅读阐释过程中会出现某种意义，那一定存在某种具体的办法，使字谜与文本发生关系。,There must be particular ways of relating anagram to text if any meaning is to result from the operation.
9704,那么，我们究竟如何区分“人咬狗”跟“狗咬人”呢?,So how do we actually distinguish “Man bites dog” from “Dog bites man”?
9704,在字典上，咬的定义写的是 “咬的人是主语，被咬的东西是受词”，但是我们如何在树状图上找到主语和受词呢?,The dictionary entry for “bite” says ''The biter is the subject; the bitten thing is the object.'' But how do we find subjects and objects in the tree?
9704,文法规则在名词短语上挂了个小标签，使它可以跟动词意义所规范的角色相配合。,Grammar puts little tags on the noun phrases that can be matched up with the roles laid out in a verb's dictionary entry.
9704,这个小标签就叫做“格”。,These tags are called cases.
9704,在许多语言里，这个格是以名词的字首或字尾变化的形式出现。,"In many languages, cases appear as prefixes or suffixes on the nouns."
9705,然而，继续追究这个问题是没有意义的。原因是，关键的问题并不在于短语结构语法的“简单性”，而是在于具有短语结构成分并在生成深层结构过程中起作用的转换语法的“简单性”。,"However, it is pointless to pursue this topic, because what is at stake is not the“simplicity” of phrase structure grammars but rather of transformational grammars with a phrase structure component that plays a role in generating deep structures."
9705,并且，也绝对不存在“容易计算”或“算法的简单性”这样的数学概念，能够哪怕是含糊地暗示，符合这种系统可能优于从这一视角仔细考察过的各种自动机系统，例如有限状态自动机、线性有界自动机等等。,"And there is absolutely no mathematical concept of “ease of computation”or“simplicity of algorithm”that even vaguely suggests that such systems may have some advantage over the kinds of automata that have been seriously investigated from this point of view-for example, finite state automata, linear bounded automata, and so on."
9706,以下是英语元音辅音的特征矩阵。,Here are feature matrices for vowels and consonants in English.
9706,通过挑出所有在一个或多个特征上相同的音段，你可以辨别出自然类。,"By selecting all segments marked the same for one or more features, you can identify natural classes."
9706,"例如，高元音的自然类/i，i,u ，u / 可以在表7 .4 的元音特征图中标为[+高] ;带声塞音的自然类/b，m, d, n, g, ŋ，dʒ/可以在表7 .5 的辅音特征图中标记为[+带声] [-通]。","For example, the natural class of high vowels /i, ɪ, u, ʊ/ is marked [+high] in the vowel feature chart of Table 7.4; the natural class of voiced stops /b, m, d, n, g, ŋ, dʒ/ are the ones marked [+voice] [–continuant] in the Table 7.5."
9707,对文学专业的学生来说，列维-斯特劳斯的“结构”人类学和由此产生的结构语言学的含义必然是深刻的。,"For the student of literature, the implications of Lévi-Strauss’s sort of ‘structural’ anthropology and the structural linguistics from which it derives, must be considerable."
9707,首先，这两门学科的基本概念都为现代人攻击“现实主义”或“自然主义”提供了基础，并因而给予了动力。“现实主义”或“自然主义”的前提是，一件语言艺术作品和它必定要“涉及”的“现实”或“自然”之间存在着明显的一对一的对应。,"Primarily, the notions fundamental to both disciplines provide a basis for, and so lend power to, the modern attack on ‘realism’ or ‘naturalism’: the presupposition that a transparent ‘one-to-one’ correspondence exists between a work of art in language, and the ‘reality’ or ‘nature’ to which that work of art is presupposed to ‘refer’."
9708,要完全理解一句话的意义，我们必须把词汇串分析为句法结构，因为言语的意义除了依赖词汇的意义之外，还依赖于词序和成分结构。,"To get the full meaning of an utterance, we must parse the string into syntactic structures, because meaning depends on word order and constituent structure in addition to the meaning of words."
9708,有些心理语言学家相信我们在理解言语的过程中，既运用了自上而下处理方式也运用了自下而上处理方式。,Some psycholinguists believe we use both top-down processing and bottom-up processing during comprehension.
9708,自上而下处理方式除了利用来自感官输入的词汇信息之外，还利用了语义和句法信息，但自下而上处理方式只利用感官输入中所含有的信息。,Top-down processing uses semantic and syntactic information in addition to the lexical information drawn from the sensory input; bottom-up processing uses only information contained in the sensory input.
9709,你可以听到第五个语言发音器官的效应，假如你把Sam和sat的母音拉长，再无限延长最后的子音，你会感到这个效应。,"You can hear the effects of the fifth speech organ by drawing out the vowel in Sam and sat, and postponing the final consonant indefinitely."
9709,在英语的各个方言中，母音是不一样的。,"In most dialects of English, the vowels will be different: the vowel in Sam will have a twangy, nasal sound."
9709,Sam 的母音有鼻音，这是因为软腭是张开的，可以让空气从鼻中出来，鼻腔是另一个共鸣箱，当振动的空气流过它时，另一组频率的声波被放大和被抵消。,"That is because the soft palate or velum (the fleshy flap at the back of the hard palate) is opened, allowing air to flow out through the nose as well as through the mouth.The nose is another resonant chamber, and when vibrating air flows through it, yet another set of frequencies gets amplied and filtered."
9710,如果诗歌是一种行为，一个关键的问题是诗歌作者的行为与发言者，或者是朗诵诗歌的“声音”的行为之间的关系。,"For the poem as act, a key question has been the relation between the act of the author who writes the poem and that of the speaker or ‘voice’ that speaks there."
9710,这是一个错综复杂的问题。,This is a complicated matter.
9710,作者不用去读诗，而是要去写诗，就是说作者要想像他或她自己，或者另外一个声音去朗诵这首诗。,"The author does not speak the poem; to write it, the author imagines himself or herself or another voice speaking it."
9711,他还认为，群氓文化既不是美国土生土长的文化，也不是民主制度的必然结果。,"He claims that mass culture is not American by nature, or by example, nor is it the inevitable culture of democracy."
9711,在罗森伯格看来，群氓文化在苏联最普遍。,"Mass culture, according to Rosenberg, is nowhere more widespread than in the Soviet Union."
9711,其始作俑者不是资本主义，而是科技。,"Its author is not capitalism, but technology."
9712,小说《黑暗之心》和电影《现代启示录》中的人物库尔茨就属于这种类型。,Kurtz of both Heart of Darkness and Apocalypse Now is such a figure.
9712,第二类故事则强调拥有“种族优越性”的白人对丛林及丛林栖息者的利用与征服。,"Then there are stories of whites, who because of the supposed power of their racial heredity impose themselves on the jungle and its inhabitants."
9712,小说、电影和神话故事中常常出现的角色“人猿泰山”则是此类帝国主义小说最典型的代表。,"‘Tarzan’ (novels, films and myth) is the classic representation of this imperial fiction."
9712,在东方主义的视角下，上述两种叙事结构均包蕴着帝国主义文化的欲望和焦虑，而不仅仅是对其他种族和异域土地的征服。,From the perspective of Orientalism both narratives tell us a great deal more about the desires and anxieties of the culture of imperialism than they can ever tell us about the people and places of colonial conquest.
9713,1998年，在肥皂剧《加冕街》中，虚构人物迪尔德丽•拉希德被捕人狱。,The 1998 case of the imprisonment of Coronation Street character Deirdre Rachid is perhaps a classic example of hyperrealism.
9713,全英国的小报不但报道了这一消息，更积极呼吁将其释放，仿佛这不是一部虚构电视剧的虚构情节，而是一起“真实生活”中的事件。,"The tabloid press not only covered the story, it campaigned for her release, in much the same way as if this was an incident from ‘real life’."
9713,这或可算是超级真实主义的经典案例。,
9713,《每日星报》发起了一场名为“释放威瑟菲尔德人”的抗议运动，鼓动读者通过电话或传真的方式联名抗议。,"The Daily Star launched a campaign to ‘Free the Weatherfield One’, and invited readers to phone or fax them to register their protest."
9714,两份英国报纸在报道1992年洛杉矶暴动时（此前4名洛杉矶警察殴打一名骑摩托车的黑人Rodney King。路人录下殴打画面后，公众气愤要求严惩涉事警察，但4人却被法院无罪释放。这一事件引发了洛杉矶大规模的黑人暴动）使用的标题是“洛杉矶无法无天”和“洛杉矶之战”。很显然，编辑在制作标题的时候既未联系与该新闻事件性质相似的1965年沃茨暴动，亦未考虑游行示威者在暴乱中喊出的口号“无正义毋宁战”，而是借鉴了美国电视剧《洛城法网》的名字，完全在虚构世界里寻找对新闻故事的诠释方法。,"The riots, following the acquittal of the four Los Angeles police officers captured on video physically assaulting the black motorist Rodney King, were headlined in two British newspapers as ‘LA Lawless’, and in another as ‘LA War’ -- the story anchored not by a historical reference to similar disturbances in Watts, Los Angeles in 1965, or to the implications of the words --‘No justice no peace’--chanted by demonstrators during the riots; the editors chose instead to locate the story within the fictional world of the American television series LA Law."
9715,约于纪元前1380年席卷埃及的伟大宗教革命与政治革命，一直被描述为一个人，即诶赫那顿的业绩。,The great religious and political revolution which gripped Egypt about 1380b.c. has been pictured as the work of one man: Ikhnaton.
9715,布里斯特德说：“在埃赫那顿以前，世界史不过是传统之不可遏止的拓展。”,"""Until Ikhnaton,"" says Breasted, ""the history of the world had been but the irresistible drift of tradition."
9716,奥格拉拉人相信圆圈是神圣的，因为神灵使自然界所有的东西都成为圆的，除了石头。,The Oglala believe the circle to be sacred because the great spirit caused everything in nature to be round except stone.
9716,石头是用于破坏的工具。,Stone is the implement of destruction.
9716,太阳与天空，地球与月亮，就像盾牌一样都是圆形的，尽管天空深得像一只碗。,"The sun and the sky, the earth and the moon are round like a shield, though the sky is deep like a bowl."
9717,此外，因为一切人类语言可以互相翻译，就可以通过问答而得知人们如何看待他们自己的思想和行为。,"Moreover, because of the mutual translatability of all human languages, what people think about their thoughts and behavior can be learned through questions and answers."
9717,一个巴聪加人如何称呼他的母亲？,What does a Bathonga call his mother?
9717,“妈妈妮。”,"""Mamani."""
9718,葛兰西对文化研究作出的最大贡献就是提出了“霸权”这个概念，他用这个概念来解释（在资本主义制度的剥削和压迫之下）为何西方资本主义民主国家之内无法产生社会主义革命。,Central to the cultural studies appropriation of Gramsci is the concept of hegemony.Hegemony is for Gramsci a cultural concept developed to explain (given the exploitative and oppressive nature of capitalism) the absence of socialist revolutions in the Western capitalist democracies.
9718,"在葛兰西看来，所谓“霸权” 指的是某种进行中的状况，它描述了统治阶级（连同其他相关阶级或阶级成分）通过操纵“精神及道德领导权”的方式对社会加以引导而非统治的 过程（Gramsci, 2009: 75)。",The concept of hegemony is used by Gramsci (2009) to refer to a condition in process in which a dominant class (in alliance with other classes or class fractions) does not merely rule a society but leads it through the exercise of‘intellectual and moral leadership (75)’.
9718,在霸权之中包含了一种特殊的共识，即某个社会群体想方设法将自己的特定利益展示为整个社会的整体利益。,Hegemony involves a specific kind of consensus: a social group seeks to present its own  interests as the general interests of the society as a whole.
9718,于是，尽管社会之中始终存在着剥削和压迫，但各个阶级之间却达成了高度的共识，彼此和谐相处；被统治阶级似乎服膺于“共同的”价值、观念、目标，以及文化和政治内涵，并以此种方式被既有的权力结构“收编” (incorporate)。,"In this sense, the concept is used to suggest a society in which, despite oppression and exploitation, there is a high degree of consensus, a large measure of social stability; a society in which subordinate groups and classes appear to actively support and subscribe to values, ideals, objectives, cultural and political meanings, which bind them to, and ‘incorporate’ them into, the prevailing structures of power."
9719,大众文化的第五个定义来自意大利马克思主义者安东尼奥•葛兰西的政治分析，尤其与其对“霸权”这一概念的发展密切相关。,"A fifth definition of popular culture, then, is one that draws on the political analysis of the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci, particularly on his development of the concept of hegemony."
9719,葛兰西用“霸权”这个词来指涉社会统治集团如何通过控制“智力与道德的领导权”来贏取被统治集团的赞同。,"Gramsci uses the term ‘hegemony’ to refer to the way in which dominant groups in society, through a process of ‘intellectual and moral leadership’, seek to win the consent of subordinate groups in society."
9719,对此，我们将在第四章进行详细讨论。,This will be discussed in some detail in Chapter 4.
9720,这个问题仍在等待答案。任何谙熟历史学、社会学或人类学论争的人都不难同意关于文化的科学仍缺乏真正的识别标准，即观察什么和怎样观察，比较什么和怎样比较关于在进化和传播中探索什么的标准，在这门迟到的科学中有一个学派的成员将他们的研究建基于拜日文化（heliolithic culture)的概念之上或其周围。,"That this problem still awaits its solution, and that the science of culture still lacks real criteria of identification—that is, criteria of what to observe and how to observe, what to compare and how to carry it out, of what to trace in evolution and diffusion —will hardly be disputed by anyone acquainted with the controversies of history, sociology, or anthropology.In this latter science, there is one school whose members base most of their researches on and around the concept of heliolithic culture."
9720,反对这种理论的学者直接否认拜日文化是可以在世界各地予以识别的现实。,Those who reject such theories would flatly deny that heliolithic culture is a reality which can be identified all over the globe.
9720,他们对从巨石纪念碑、二元组织（dual organization)、象牙符号、将子安贝 (cowrie shell)贝壳解释成性象征为参照物进行的识别，大有争议。事实上，他们对每一项假定的现实都不以为然。,"They would dispute the identification carried out with reference to megalithic monuments, dual organization, the elephant's trunk symbol, the interpretation of the sexual symbolism in the cowrie shell, in fact, every one of the realities postulated."
9721,消费是对资本主义体制的战术袭击。,
9721,正如德塞都（1984: 31）所言：实际上，一个理性化的、扩张主义的、中心化的、奇观式的以及声势浩大的生产，正遭遇着一种判然有别的生产，它 的名字叫“消费”。其特征是：诡计、分裂（这是环境使然）、偷袭、秘密性、不知疲傣却静悄悄地行为……简言之，“消费”有一种半隐蔽性（quasi-invisibility），因为它展现自己的方式，不是凭借它自己的产品（它会把这些产品放在哪里呢？），而是凭借一种艺术，一种利用那些强加到“消费”之上的产品的艺术。,"As de Certeau (1984: 31) puts it: In reality, a rationalized, expansionist, centralized, spectacular and clamorous production is confronted by an entirely different kind of production, called ""consumption"" and characterized by its ruses, its fragmentation (the results of the circumstances), its poaching, its clandestine nature, its tireless but quiet activity, in short by its quasi-invisibility, since it shows itself not in its own products (where would it place them?) but in an art of using those imposed on it."
9722,在艾柯看来，这种斗争尽管是机会主义的结果，却确定了弗莱明的摩尼教意识形态，形成了一种基本的二元对立面。,"This struggle, which  for Eco defines Fleming's Manichaean ideology even if it is the result of opportunism, forms a fundamental binary opposition."
9722,邦德系列小说类似于童话，在其中，一个骑士（邦德）按照国王（M）的命令去执行一项消灭妖怪——如一条恐龙（那个反面人物）——的任务，并营救夫人（那个女人）。,"The Bond novels are comparable to fairy tales in which a knight (Bond), under the orders of a king (M), goes on a mission to destroy the monster, such as a dragon (the villain), and rescue the lady (the woman)."
9722,这两类故事都涉及到体现了善与恶之间二元对立的各种基本因素的转换。,Both types of story involve transformations of the basic elements embodied in the binary opposition between good and evil.
9723,同时他又在精确科学(exact sciences)研究常有的教条主义面前保持了自由。,At the same time he remained free from the dogmatism usually associated with the study of the exact sciences.
9723,维尔海姆·冯特把他的兴趣导向了文化人类学。,His interests were diverted to cultural anthropology by Wilhelm Wundt.
9723,"他主要田野工作地点是新几内亚和西北美拉尼西亚，特别是特罗布里恩群岛。但他也曾简单调查过澳大利亚的一些部落、亚利桑那州的荷比人(the Hopi) 、东非的本巴人(the Bemba)和查卡人(the Chagga),以及墨西哥的查布特克人(the Zapotec)。","Although his basic fieldwork was done in New Guinea and Northwestern Melanesia, parThe Interpretation of Culturesularly in the Trobriand Islands, he also spent briefer intervals with some Australian tribes, the Hopi of Arizona, the Bemba and Chagga of East Africa and the Zapotec of Mexico."
9724,但是，在现实中，在近距离审视的放大镜之下，我们就能看出更加多样化的倾向、理论和方法。每一派都以关于什么是真正解释原则的某种根本概念为特征；每一派都有它希望用以理解文化过程和产物的具体方法；每一派在进入田野时都有一套略显不同的知识分类架构(pigeonholes)来收集和分装证据。,"In reality, however, and under the magnifying glass of closer scrutiny, we could find a much greater diversity of tendencies, theories, and methods, each characterized by some ultimate conception as to what is the real principle of interpretation; each having some specific approach through which it hopes to reach the comprehension of a cultural process or product; each going into the field with a somewhat differential set of intellectual pigeonholes into which to gather and distribute evidence."
9724,"于是，就有了比较方法，学者们使用它时，兴趣主要在于收集广泛的跨文化材料，就像我们在弗雷泽的《金枝》(The Golden Bough) 和泰勒的《原始文化》( Primitive Culture),以及韦斯特马克关于婚姻和道德的著作中看到的那样。","Thus there is the comparative method, in which the student is primarily interested in gathering extensive cross-cultural documentations, such as we see in Frazer's The Golden Bough, or in Tylor's Primitive Culture, or in the volumes of Westermarck on marriage and morals."
9724,"在这些著作中，作者主要感兴趣的是指示出泛灵信仰(animisThe Interpretation of Cultures belief) 或巫术仪式(magical rite),或人类文化的某一阶段，或基本组织某一类型的根本性质。","In such works the authors are primarily interested in laying bare the essential nature of animisThe Interpretation of Cultures belief or magical rite, of a phase in human culture or a type of essential organization."
9724,很显然，这整个方法预设了一个关于所比较的现实的真正科学定义。,"Obviously, this whole approach presupposes a really scientific definition of the realities compared."
9725,很显然，这整个方法预设了一个关于所比较的现实的真正科学定义。,"Obviously, this whole approach presupposes a really scientific definition of the realities compared."
9725,除非我们列出真正可比的现象的详尽无遗的“清单”，而且不为表面的相似之处或虚构的类推所欺骗，否则，大量工作却会导致错误结论 。,"Unless we list, in our exhaustive inventories, really comparable phenomena, and are never duped by surface similarities or fictitious analogies, a great deal of labor may lead to incorrect conclusions."
9725,我们还应记住，比较的方法必须始终是任何归纳，任何理论原则，或任何适用于我们的研究课题的普遍法则的基础。,"Let us also remember that the comparative method must remain the basis of any generalization, any theoreThe Interpretation of Culturesal principle, or any universal law applicable to our subject matter."
9726,为了掩饰这种“标准化”，音乐工业采取了阿多诺所称的“伪个人化”策略：“音乐的标准化使消费者按照生产者规定的方式“规规矩矩地”听歌。而伪个人化所发挥的作用就是让他们在乖乖听歌的同时完全意识不到自己的听歌方式是被控制的，或者说，这些歌都是被“预先消化”过的。”,"In order to conceal standardization, the music industry engages in what Adorno calls ""pseudo-individualization"": ""Standardisation of song hits keeps the customers in line by doing their  listening for them, as it were. Pseudo- individualization, for its part, keeps them in line by making them forget that what they listen to is already listened to for them, or ""pre-digested""."
9727,旧人类学的另一主导倾向是强调播化。即强调一个文化向其他文化的采纳（adopting)或借用（borrowing)各种用具、工具、制度及信仰的过程。,"The other dominant tendency of older anthropology laid primary stress on diffusion, that is, the process of adopting or borrowing by one culture from another various devices, implements, institutions, and beliefs."
9727,播化作为一种文化过程，和进化一样，是真实存在和无可攻击的。,Diffusion as a cultural process is as real and unassailable as evolution.
9727,这两种过程之间看来也实在难觅其异。,It seems certain that no distinction can be made between the two processes.
9727,况且，尽管两个学派的支持者有些不肯妥协和敌视态度，但他们都从不同角度研究了文化成长问題，并为说明这个问题做出了各自的贡献。,"The votaries of either school, however, in spite of their somewhat intransigent and hostile attitude to each other, have approached the problem of culture growth from different angles and have contributed to its illumination independently."
9728,进化论与播化论的歧异——每种学说内部自然也为部分学派和分歧的观点——看来是人类学方法和概念“装备”的主要分水岭。,"The rift between evolutionism and diffusionism—and each of them, of course, contains a number of partial schools and divergent opinions—still appears as the main dividing line in method and conceptual outfit."
9728,如今，这两派之外有时又加上功能学派。本文作者常被认为是它的主要责任人。,"To these two, there is sometimes added at present the functional school, for which the present writer is often held to be largely responsible."
9728,但是，在现实中，在近距离审视的放大镜之下，我们就能看出更加多样化的倾向、理论和方法。每一派都以关于什么是真正解释原则的某种根本概念为特征；每一派都有它希望用以理解文化过程和产物的具体方法；每一派在进人田野时都带有一套略显不同的知识分类架构来收集和分装证据。,"In reality, however, and under the magnifying glass of closer scrutiny, we could find a much greater diversity of tendencies, theories, and methods, each characterized by some ultimate conception as to what is the real principle of interpretation; each having some specific approach through which it hopes to reach the comprehension of a cultural process or product; each going into the field with a somewhat differential set of intellectual pigeonholes into which to gather and distribute evidence."
9729,我们将看到，物质事物在文化中扮演着十分具体的角色。,"Material objects, as we shall see, play a very specific part in culture."
9729,"将一件人工制品作为某一文化因素的模型,有着极大危险。",To take an artifact as the model of a cultural element is exceedingly dangerous.
9729,人们针对文化圈理论（Kulturkreislehre)而提出的主要批评是它将一件艺术品的物理形式看作文化识别的主要或全部指标（index)的谬论。,The main criThe Interpretation of Culturesisms which will be made against the Kulturkreislehre are directed at the fallacy of taking the physical form of an artifact as the main or exclusive index of cultural identification.
9729,主要受安克尔曼（Ankermann)和格雷布纳（Graebner)一类“博物馆鼹鼠”的影响，播化论总是与在古旧建筑的展柜和地窖中堆放，分类不清、定义不准的器物中得到的启示有关。,"Diffusionism, mainly through the influence of certain museum moles like Graebner and Ankermann, has been linked up with the inspiration of ill-assorted and ill-defined objects lumped together in the vitrines and cellars of an old building."
9729,但是，既然播化论的基础必须是对那些显示在地图上的文化现实的正确识别，所以，派生于著名的形态标准和数量标准的错误识别，就对它那本来尚可接受的倾向的健康发展造成了浩劫。,"Since, however, the basis of diffusionism must be a correct identification of cultural realities plotted on the map, the false identifications derived from the famous criteria of form and quantity have played great havoc with the sound development of that otherwise essentially acceptable tendency."
9730,相似的批评也适用于大多数播化学派所使用的基本概念，即 “特质”和“特质丛”。,"A similar adverse criticism must be applied to the fundamental concept of most diffusionist schools, that of the trait and trait complex."
9730,同其他任何比较研究一样，播化论首先必须面对和解决识別的难题。,"In diffusion, as in any other comparative research, the problem of identity first has to be faced and solved."
9730,最先直面这一难题之功应首推德国博物馆民族学家弗•格雷布纳，他早年受到历史学方面的训练，但在开创性著作《民族学方法》中，确立了著名的，经常为人引用的形态和数量的标准。,"The credit of having faced this first belongs to F. Graebner, the German museum ethnologist, in his earlier career trained in history, who established the famous and oft-repeated criteria of form and quantity in his pioneering work, Methode der Ethnologie (1911)."
9731,折衷主义是本世纪前半期美国的主导研究策略。,Eclecticism  was the dominant research strategy in the United States during the first half of this century.
9731,在弗朗兹·博厄斯的深入的影响下。美国人类学家致力于在同韦斯勒的普遍类型纲领大体一致的广阔题材范围里收集实地资料。,"Under the pervasive influence of Franz Boas, American anthropologists devoted themselves to the collection of field data over a broad range of topics roughly corresponding to Wissler’s scheme of universal categories."
9732,在纯粹的宗教和宗教应用之间，在遭遇到设想的“真正的真实”和以这种遭遇观察普通经验之间，存在着质的差别——这种差别是经验的而不是超验的。对差别的认识和探索将使我们比原始神秘主义者和原始实用主义者更深刻地理解当博罗罗人说“我是一只鹦鹉”和一个基督徒说“我是一个罪人”时他们是什么意思。在原始神秘主义理论中，普通世界消失在一片奇怪思想的云雾中；在原始实用主义理论中，宗教分解成一些有用的虚构。,"The recognition and exploration of the qualitative difference-an empirical, not a transcendental difference-between religion pure and religion applied, between an encounter with the supposedly ""really real"" and a viewing of ordinary experience in light of what that encounter seems to reveal, will, therefore, take us further toward an understanding of what a Bororo means when he says ""I am a parakeet,"" or a Christian when he says ""I am a sinner,"" than either a theory of primitive mysticism in which the commonplace world disappears into a cloud of curious ideas or of a primitive pragmatism in which religion disintegrates into a collection of useful fictions."
9733,同时他又在精确科学(exact sciences)研究常有的教条主义面前保持了自由。,At the same time he remained free from the dogmatism usually associated with the study of the exact sciences.
9733,维尔海姆·冯特把他的兴趣导向了文化人类学。,His interests were diverted to cultural anthropology by Wilhelm Wundt.
9733,"他主要田野工作地点是新几内亚和西北美拉尼西亚，特别是特罗布里恩群岛。但他也曾简单调查过澳大利亚的一些部落、亚利桑那州的荷比人(the Hopi) 、东非的本巴人(the Bemba)和查卡人(the Chagga),以及墨西哥的查布特克人(the Zapotec)。","Although his basic fieldwork was done in New Guinea and Northwestern Melanesia, particularly in the Trobriand Islands, he also spent briefer intervals with some Australian tribes, the Hopi of Arizona, the Bemba and Chagga of East Africa and the Zapotec of Mexico."
9734,如果列出世界上各种文化的所有表现，我们就会明显地发现一系列详尽的边缘古怪习俗：如食人之风（cannibalism)、猎头、 产翁制（couvade)、夸富宴（potlatch)、库拉圈（kula)、火葬(cremation)、木乃伊（mummification)等。,"Were we to plot out all the manifestations of every culture in the world, we obviously would find such elements as cannibalism, head-hunting, couvade, potlatch, kula, cremation, mummification, and a vast array of detailed peripheral eccentricities."
9734,就此而论，显然没有单一的文化能够包罗许多其他文化中的所有形式的畸形和怪癖。,From this point of view obviously no single culture covers all the itemized freaks and eccentricities of many others.
9734,然而我要说，这种研究方法在本质上是不科学的。,"Yet this approach, I submit, is essentially unscientific."
9735,1998年，在肥皂剧《加冕街》中，虚构人物迪尔德丽•拉希德被捕人狱。,The 1998 case of the imprisonment of Coronation Street character Deirdre Rachid is perhaps a classic example of hyperrealism.
9735,全英国的小报不但报道了这一消息，更积极呼吁将其释放，仿佛这不是一部虚构电视剧的虚构情节，而是一起“真实生活”中的事件。,"The tabloid press not only covered the story, it campaigned for her release, in much the same way as if this was an incident from ‘real life’."

9736,如班泽尔博士所说，超自然物“没有与人类为敌的意向，因为人类可扣压他们的供品，它们的支撑必须由祭品、祈祷、巫术习俗给予保证。,"The supernaturals, as Dr. Buozel says, 'have no animus against man. In as much as they may withhold their gifts, their assistance must be secured by offerings, prayers and magical practices.'"
9736,”但它不是对邪恶势力的抚慰。,But it is no placation of evil forces.
9736,因为可能有所保留，它们对人类的帮助必须由祭品、祈祷、巫术习俗给予保证。,
9736,”但这样说并不是对邪恶势力的抚慰。,
9737,这种世界性的文化传播却妨碍了我们。让我们没有认真对待其他民族的文明，此前从未有过这样的妨碍。它已赋予了我们的文化以一种我们已很久未从历史上予以说明的巨大的普遍性，而且这个普遍性我们也能解释成是必要的和不可避免的。,"This world-wide cultural diffusion has protected us as man had never been protected before from having to take seriously the civilizations of other peoples; it has given to our culture a massive universality that we have long ceased to account for historically, and which we read off rather as necessary and evitable."
9738,列维—施特劳斯指出，神话的运行方式和语言是一样的。神话是由“神话素”构成的，就像语言是由“词素”和“音素”等单元构成的一样。,"Myths, Lévi-Strauss argues, work like language: they comprise individual ""mythemes"", analogous to individual units of language, ""morphemes"" and ""phonemes""."
9738,如词素和音素一般，神话素无法独立生成意义，而必须以某种方式被组合起来方可。,"Like morphemes and phonemes, mythemes only take on meaning when combined in particular patterns."
9739,人类是一个动物物种，他们受基本自然条件的制约。,Human beings are an animal species.
9739,只有满足这些条件，个人才能生存，种族才能延续，整个物种的正常形态才能维持。,"They are subject to elemental conditions which have to be fulfilled so that individuals may survive, the race continue and organisms one and all he maintained in working order."
9739,此外，人在其整套物质装备和制造及鉴赏这套装备的能力之外，又创造出另一个次生环境（secondary environment)。,"Again, in his whole outfit of artifacts and his ability to produce them and to appreciate them, man creates a secondary environment."
9739,这些都已是老生常谈，况且类似的文化定义经常得到陈述和详尽说明。,"There is nothing new said so far, and similar definitions of culture have often been stated and elaborated."
9739,但是，我们还要引出一两条额外的结论。,"We shall, however, draw one or two additional conclusions."
9740,有几位美国权威人士指出，在日本整个封建时代的七百余年中，天皇一直是有名无实的傀儡元首。,Some American authorities pointed out that through all Japan's seven feudal centuries the Emperor was a shadowy figurehead.
9740,每个人所尽忠的对象是各自直接的主君——“大名”，以及大名之上的军事大元帅——将军。,"Every man's immediate loyalty was due to his lord, the daimyo, and, beyond that, to the military Generalissimo, the Shogun."
9740,对天皇忠诚与否，几乎根本投人关心。,Fealty to the Emperor was hardly an issue.
9740,天皇被幽禁在被隔绝的宫廷之中，其活动和仪式均受将军所制定的规章制度的严格限制。,He was kept secluded in an isolated court whose ceremonies and activities were rigorously circumscribed by the Shogun's regulations.
9741,或者换个稍微不同的说法，可以比较那些案例：一类是比现有的公民国家要小而在种族、部落、语言等方面充满“一体团体情感”的群体，另一些是比较大，或者至少在某种形式上超出了边界之外的群体。,"Or, put somewhat differently, one can contrast those cases in which the racial, tribal, linguistic, and so on, reference group that is charged with a ""corporate sentiment of oneness"" is smaller than the existing civil state, and those where it is larger, or at least transcends its borders in some fashion."
9741,在第一个例子中，产生于政治压制；在第二个例子中，产生于政治解体感。,"In the first instance primordial discontent arises from a sense of political suffocation; in the second, from a sense of political dismemberment."
9741,缅甸的克伦人、加纳的阿散蒂人或乌干达的巴干达人的分裂主义是前者的例子；泛阿拉伯主义、大索马里主义、泛非洲主义，是后者的例子。,"Karen separatism in Burma, Ashanti in Ghana, or Baganda in Uganda are examples of the former; pan-Arabism, greater Somaliism, pan-Africanism, of the latter."
9742,从很多方面看，这都不是件易事。,"This is, in many ways, a daunting task."
9742,正如托尼•本内特（Tony Bennett)所指出的那样：“从当下情况看，‘大众文化’这一概念实在无用， 它似乎把若干混沌不清乃至彼此抵触的含义塞进一个大熔炉，只会将种种对真相的探索引入理论的死胡同。,"As Tony Bennett (1980) points out, ‘as it stands, the concept of popular culture is virtually useless, a melting pot of confused and contradictory meanings capable of misdirecting inquiry up any number of theoretical’ (18)."
9742,”（Bennett，1980: 18)此种“界定困难”一部分源自“他者”（otherness)这一概念的特殊性--当我们使用 “大众文化”这一表述时，暗示着与大众文化相对的“他者”总是缺席/在场的。,Part of the difficulty stems from the implied otherness that is always absent/ present when we use the term ‘popular culture’.
9742,在阅读后面的章节时，你也会发现我们往往有意无意地将大众文化与其他文化——民间文化、群氓文化、宰制性文化、工人阶级文化等等——进行对比，并在对比中为“大众文化”下定义。,"As we shall see in the chapters which follow, popular culture is always defined, implicitly or explicitly, in contrast to other conceptual categories: folk culture, mass culture, dominant culture, working-class culture, etc."
9743,大众文明及伴随而来的群氓文化架设了一个极具破坏力的战场，时刻威胁着我们，要使我们“不可避免地陷人混乱之中”。,"Mass civilization and its mass culture pose a subversive front, threatening‘to land us in irreparable chaos’."
9743,正是为了与大众文明展开斗争，利维斯主义才登上了历史舞台，竭力鼓吹“要在学校教育中加人抵制（群氓文化）的训练”。在学校之外，利维斯主义主张“‘少数人’应当武装起来，主动出击，自觉地采用各种抵抗的形式”。,"It is against this threat that Leavisism writes its manifestos, and proposes ‘to introduce into schools a training in resistance to mass culture’; and outside schools, to promote a‘conscious and directed effort...to take the form of resistance by an armed and active minority."
9743,,’
9744,在所有这些表述里，我们看到迄今为止，人们对我们在前一章里描述过的科学活动尚未给予充分注意。它应该包括活跃于巫术、图腾崇拜、氏族体系、家庭制度等文化事实相关要素做出明确的界定和联系。,"In all this we can see that not sufficient attention has been given so far to that scientific activity which we described in a previous section, and which consists in clearly defining and relating the relevant factors which operate in such cultural facts as magic, totemism, the clan system, and the domestic institution."
9744,首当其冲的是，有必要表明我们需要在不同文化中对其进行比较，要追索其进化过程或追踪其播化途径的各种现象，是我们进行观察和理论讨论的合理单元（isolate)。,"It is necessary to show, first and foremost, that a phenomenon which we want to compare in various cultures, which we want to trace in its evolution or follow in its diffusion, is a legitimate isolate of both observation and theoretical discourse."
9744,因此，我们就有必要清楚明确地说明那众多的物质决定要素，人类行动、信仰和观念，亦即象征表达，是从哪里进入这一单元或文化现实，它们如何互动，又是如何获得彼此间稳定和必然的关系特性。,"It is necessary to state clearly and precisely where the material determinants, human actions, beliefs and ideas, that is, symbolic performances, enter into such an isolate or reality of culture, how they interact and how they obtain that character of permanent, necessary relationship to each other."
9745,非洲的泛民族主义运动主要是基于种族，库尔德斯坦是基于部落主义；在老挝是几个掸邦；泰国是基于语言。,"Pan-national movements in Africa are largely based on race, in Kurdistan, on tribalism; in Laos, the Shan States, and Thailand, on language."
9745,但是所有这些现象在某种意义上都属于一类。,"Yet all these phenomena, too, are in some sense of a piece."
9745,它们形成了一个确定的研究领域。,They form a definable field of investigation.
9746,根据我对阿多诺的论点的概述，他显然很少作出努力从经验上来论证他所提出的主张。,It should be evident from the outline above that Adorno makes few attempts to substantiate empirically the claims he makes.
9746,例如，他对倒退倾听的讨论，一点都没有提到真正的听众们。确切地说，它依赖于一个受其理论限定的推论出来的主题。,"For example, his discussion of regressive listening makes no reference to audience studies but instead relies on inferences from his theory."
9747,在德川幕府于十九世纪后半叶崩溃时，日本没有任何集团主张废除这些规范。,"When the Tokugawa regime crumbled in the first half of the nineteenth century, no group in the nation was in favor of tearing up the map."
9747,那里没有发生“法国大革命”，甚至连“1848年式的革命”（指“二月革命”）也没有发生。,There was no French Revolution.There was not even an 1848.
9747,然而，形势已无可挽回。,Yet the times were desperate.
9748,在家庭内部，我们看到信仰与祖先崇拜相关。,Within the family we find beliefs related to ancestor worship.
9748,氏族信仰与崇拜或人或兽的祖先图腾相关，起着宗教集会的功能。,"The clan with its worship of totemic forebears, animal or human, functions as a religious congregation."
9748,在村庄、城镇和领地群内，我们看到地缘性的崇拜（local cults)。,"We find local cults of villages, cities, and municipalities."
9748,宗教也经常成为各类政治国家和帝国的关注焦点。,Religion often becomes also the center of political states and empires.
9749,日本人生活中的等级制习惯，在阶级关系上象在家庭中一样地强烈。,The hierarchal arrangements of Japanese life have been as drastic in relations between the classes as they have been in the family.
9749,在整个历史上，日本一直是个等级森严的阶级社会。一个有几个世纪等级制习惯的民族，既有其重大的长处，也有其重大的短处。,"In all her national history Japan has been a strong class and caste society, and a nation which has a centuries-long habit of caste arrangements has certain strengths and certain weaknesses which are of the utmost importance."
9750,克莉丝汀•格莱德希尔发表过类似的观点。她认为女性主义文化研究“应当将广受鄙夷的大众文化形式与具体的文化消费环境相结合，并将其受众视为由社会历史建构的产物”。,Christine Gledhill makes a similar point: she advocates a feminist cultural studies ‘which relates commonly derided popular forms to the condition of their consumption in the lives of sociohistorical constituted audiences’.
9750,她声称：“只有如此，对女性电影和肥皂剧的女性主义分析才能跳出对女性观看行为的负面电影精神分析的窠臼，超越女性被征服、被孤立、被凌虐的身份立场。”,"‘In this respect’, she observes, ‘feminist analysis of the woman’s film and soap opera is beginning to counter more negative cine-psychoanalytic . . . accounts of female spectatorship, suggesting colonized, alienated or masochistic positions of identification’."
9751,对名分的“情义”，就是使名声不受玷污的义务。,Giri to one's name is the duty to keep one's reputation unspotted.
9751,这种“情义’由一系列德行构成，在西欧人看来，有的互相矛盾，但对日本人来说则是完全统一的。因为这类义务不是报恩，不属于“恩的范围”，不涉及往日受恩于别人的问题，而是保持自身名誉的行为。,"It is a series of virtues—some of which seem to an Occidental to be opposites, but which to the Japanese have a sufficient unity because they are those duties which are not repayments on benefits received; they are 'outside the circle of on."
9751,,'
9752,大众在观看电视剧《全家福》（All in the Family）中那位刚愎自用的阿尔竒·邦克（Archie Bunker)时，会因为把自己放在他们所塑造的不同的社会层理与文化效忠从属关系中，而对这一人物形象有迥然不同的理解。,"People watching Archie Bunker, the bigoted male in All in the Family, made sense of him quite differently according to how they positioned themselves within the social formation and thus the cultural allegiances they forged."
9752,当观众把邦克用作一种文化资源，来思考他们自己的社会体验和意义时，邦克的意义，便能够并的确在阶级轴、年龄轴、性别轴、种族轴之间（此处仅枚举若干最明显的轴线）移动不止。,
9752,,"""His"" meanings could and did move fluidly along the axes of class, age, gender, and race, to name only the most obvious, as viewers used him as a cultural resource to think through their social experience and the meanings they made out of it."
9752,大众文本的这种多义的开放性 (polysemic openness)，正是社会差异所需要的，并被用来维持、置疑、思索这些差异。,"The polysemic openness of popular texts is required by social differences and is used to maintain, question, and think through those differences."
9753,根据其他文化形式，所有上述婚姻方式，都包含了为年轻人做群体财产的投资。,All those which according to other cultural forms involve investment of group property for the young man.
9753,祖尼人干脆就根除了这些情形。,Zufii simply eliminates the occasions.
9753,每种安排都防止孩子受俄底浦斯情结困扰的可能性。,Every arrangement militates against the possibility of the child's suffering from an Oedipus complex.
9754,比起阶级之间的对抗，大众与权力集团之间的对立，才是整个矛盾的主线，而文化区域正是围绕着这一矛盾分化的。,"The people versus the power-bloc: this, rather than ""class-against-class,"" is the central line of contradiction around which the terrain of culture is polarized."
9754,大众文化更是围绕着这一矛盾，即大众力量与权力集团的对抗加以组织的。霍尔由此作结，大众文化研究的开始处，每每是“遏制与对抗的双向运动，这在大众文化内部常常是难以避免的。”,"Popular culture, especially, is organized around the contradiction: the popular forces verses the power-bloc.This leads him to conclude that the study of popular culture should always start wth ""the double movement of containment and resistance, which is always inevitably inside it"""
9755,但是，正如费斯克指出的那样：“在资本主义社会里，不存在所谓的‘本真’民间文化，自然也就无法用‘本真与否’去衡量群氓文化的价值。故而，对‘本真’的哀悼注定只是沉浸在浪漫怀旧中的一种徒然无功的行为。,"But as Fiske points out, ‘In capitalist societies there is no so-called authentic folk culture against which to measure the “inauthenticity” of mass culture, so bemoaning the loss of the authentic is a fruitless exercise in romantic nostalgia’."
9755,”这一观点同样适用于对“逝去的有机社区”的分析。,This also holds true for the ‘lost’ organic community.
9755,在第四章中，我们会发现法兰克福学派将消逝的“黄金时代”置于未来而非过去。,"The Frankfurt School, as we shall see in Chapter 4, locate the lost golden age, not in the past, but in the future."
9756,另一个更引人注目的例子是美国反正统文化的音乐。这种音乐鼓励人们反抗既定的人生规划，抵制纳粹美利坚对越南发动的战争；而与此同时，这种音乐也为文化工业带来了巨额利润（音乐自身对此无法控制），这些利润很可能被用来支持美国军队在越南战场上的军事行动。杰斐逊飞机乐队越是高唱“你的所有私人财产/都是敌人攻击的靶/而你的敌人/就是我们自己，RCA唱片公司赚的钱就越多。,"""Another example, in some ways more compelling than that of reggae, is the music of the American counterculture. It inspired people to resist the draft and to organize against Amerika’s war in Vietnam; yet, at the same time, its music made profits (over which it had no control) that could then be used to support the war effort in Vietnam. The more Jefferson Airplane sang‘All your private property/Is target for your enemy/ And your enemy/Is We’, the more money RCA Records made. """
9757,或者换个稍微不同的说法，可以比较那些案例：一类是比现有的公民国家要小而在种族、部落、语言等方面充满“一体团体情感”的群体，另一些是比较大，或者至少在某种形式上超出了边界之外的群体。,"Or, put somewhat differently, one can contrast those cases in which the racial, tribal, linguistic, and so on, reference group that is charged with a ""corporate sentiment of oneness"" is smaller than the existing civil state, and those where it is larger, or at least transcends its borders in some fashion."
9757,在第一个例子中，原生性不满，产生于政治压制；在第二个例子中，产生于政治解体感。,"In the first instance primordial discontent arises from a sense of political suffocation; in the second, from a sense of political dismemberment."
9757,缅甸的克伦人、加纳的阿散蒂人或乌干达的巴干达人的分裂主义是前者的例子；泛阿拉伯主义、大索马里主义、泛非洲主义，是后者的例子。,"Karen  separatism in Burma, Ashanti in Ghana, or Baganda in Uganda are examples of the former; pan-Arabism, greater Somaliism, pan-Africanism, of the latter."
9758,或者换个稍微不同的说法，可以比较那些案例：一类是比现有的公民国家要小而在种族、部落、语言等方面充满“一体团体情感”的群体，另一些是比较大，或者至少在某种形式上超出了边界之外的群体。,"Or, put somewhat differently, one can contrast those cases in which the racial, tribal, linguistic, and so on, reference group that is charged with a ""corporate sentiment of oneness"" is smaller than the existing civil state, and those where it is larger, or at least transcends its borders in some fashion."
9758,在第一个例子中，原生性不满，产生于政治压制；在第二个例子中，产生于政治解体感。,"In the first instance primordial discontent arises from a sense of political suffocation; in the second, from a sense of political dismemberment."
9758,缅甸的克伦人、加纳的阿散蒂人或乌干达的巴干达人的分裂主义是前者的例子；泛阿拉伯主义、大索马里主义、泛非洲主义，是后者的例子。,"Karen  separatism in Burma, Ashanti in Ghana, or Baganda in Uganda are examples of the former; pan-Arabism, greater Somaliism, pan-Africanism, of the latter."
9759,我们多少有些信口开河地谈论观念和价值，利益和信仰；我们在巫术和宗教的分析中讨论民间故事的动机和教条性的概念。,"We speak more or less glibly about ideas and values, about interests and beliefs; we discuss motive in folk tales, and dogmatic conceptions in the analysis of magic or religion."
9759,当研究一种一神教信仰，或神力 (mana)的观念，或泛灵论（animism )、前泛灵论（preanimism) 以及图腾崇拜的倾向时，我们能在什么意义上谈论形态？,"In what sense can we speak of form when we approach the belief in one God, or the concept of mana, or the tendency toward animism, preanimism, or totemism?"
9759,有些社会学家求诸于集体制裁（collective censorium)的假设，假定社会是“一个客观的道德存在，将其意志强加于其成员。,"Some sociologists resort to the hypothesis of a collective censorium, hypostatize society as ""the objective moral being, which imposes its will upon its members."""
9759,但很明显，不能诉诸观察的任何东西都不是客视的。,"It is clear, however, that nothing can be objective which is not accessible to observation."
9760,贝洛克认为这种社会从两个方面崩溃:一方面是国家采取福利行动(纯粹的资本主义无法体现的行动）；另一方面是垄断并限制交易。,Belloc sees it breaking down in two ways: on the one hand into State action for welfare (which pure capitalism cannot embody); on the other hand into monopoly and the restraint of trade.
9760,资本主义制度既然崩溃，只有两条路可供选择:社会主义——贝洛克称之为集体主义；以及大规模重新分配财产——贝洛克称之为分产主义。,"There are only two alternatives to this system: socialism, which Belloc calls collectivism; and the redistribution of property on a significant scale, which Belloc calls distributivism."
9760,如果把我们的社会困境视为工业革命的产物，那就不能了解这种困境，因为现代社会并不是由于工业的发展而形成的事实上英囯在工业制度以前就有资本主义。,"Our social difficulties will not be understood if they are regarded as the product of the Industrial Revolution: modern society was not formed by the growth of industry, but by the fact that capitalism was here in England before the Industrial System."
9760,……在一连串重大发现之前，工业制度的策源地英国，就已经被一种有钱人的寡头政治所控制。,". . . England, the seed-plot of the Industrial System, was already captured by a wealthy oligarchy before the series of great discoveries began."
9761,然而，这个最佳食谱又必须参考一个给定文化来确定。,"This optimum, however, must be defined with reference to a given culture."
9761,因为只有在参考肌肉和神经的活动量、任务的复杂程度，以及特定文化形貌对其成员的潜在紧张和努力的要求时，这个最佳食谱才可被界定。,"For the optimum is only definable with relation to the amount of labor, muscular and nervous, to the complexity of tasks, to potential strains and efforts demanded by a given cultural configuration from its members."
9761,同时，如果我们不参考环境供应力，生产体系和分配上的可行性，营养学家提供的这个理想方式，就不会有任何理论和实践意义。,"At the same time, the ideal formula provided by a dietitian is of no practical or theoretical importance unless we can relate it to environmental supplies, to the systems of production and possibilities of distribution."
9762,(扎根美学）是从符号与实践中获取意义的创造性元素，通过对符号与实践进行选择、再选择、强化以及重组来反映更合时宜、更独特的意义。,"[Grounded aesthetics] is the creative element in a process whereby meanings are attributed to symbols and practices and where symbols and practices are selected, reselected, highlighted and recomposed to resonate further appropriate and particularised meanings."
9762,这一过程既基于情感，又基于认知。,Such dynamics are emotional as well as cognitive.
9762,有多少种美学，就有多少片适宜其生长的土壤。,There are as many aesthetics as there are grounds for them to operate in.
9762,因此，扎根美学乃是共同文化的催化剂。,Grounded aesthetics are the yeast of common culture.
9763,从这个角度看待人类学，其宗旨便是扩大人类话语的范围。,"Looked at in this way, the aim of anthropology is the enlargement of the universe of human discourse."
9763,当然，这不是它的惟一宗旨——教学、娱乐、实际建议、道德进步、发现人类行为的自然秩序等等则是它的其他宗旨；而且人类学也不是追求这一宗旨的惟一学科。,"That is not, of course, its only aiminstruction, amusement, practical counsel, moral advance, and the discovery of natural order in human behavior are others; nor is anthropology the only discipline which pursues it."
9763,但是，这却是一个符号学的文化概念特别适合的宗旨。,But it is an aim to which a semiotic concept of culture is peculiarly well adapted.
9764,有关巴干维尔岛的记述以及法国耶稣会成员的某些著述影响了“高尚的野蛮人”理论，同时激发了卢梭和孟德斯鸠。在他们的著作中，我们已能看到人类学灵感的两个来源：把原始人的生活作为文明人的模型，以及用野蛮人的相似之处来批判现代文明。,"The accounts of Bougainville and of some of the French Jesuits influenced the theory of the Noble Savage, and inspired Rousseau and Montesquieu, in whose writings we find already two sources of anthropological inspiration: the use of primitive life as a model for civilized man, as well as a criticism of civilization by parallels from savagery."
9764,我们还看到一神更科学的意图，即通过各种变异形式的比较来理解整体的文化。,We find there also the more scientific desire to understand culture as a whole by the comparison of its varieties.
9765,这是由“大众文化”中的“大众”一词所决定的。,The popular of popular culture would seem to demand it.
9765,但也必须清楚地认识到，仅仅依靠一个量化指标是不足以对概念本身进行完全充分的界定的。,"What is also clear, however, is that on its own, a quantitative index is not enough to provide an adequate definition of popular culture."
9765,否则，很多受到权威认可的、属于“髙雅文化”的书籍、唱片和电视剧本，由于拥有很大的销量和收视率，便只能被“理所当然”地归入“大众”范畴之内了。（Bennett，1980: 20—1)。,"Such counting would almost certainly include ‘the officially sanctioned “high culture” which in terms of book and record sales and audience ratings for television dramatisations of the classics, can justifiably claim to be “popular” in this sense’ (Bennett, 1980: 20–1)."
9766,这样就保证日本政府中的高级职位都掌握在“阁下”们手中。但是，这决不意味着日本在“各安其分”的体制下没有自治。,"Japan therefore ensured that those who held high government posts remain 'Their Excellencies,' but this does not mean that there was not self-government in its 'proper place.'"
9766,在所有亚洲国家中，不管在何种政治体制下，上面的权力总在向下伸展，而在中间与下面的地方自治权碰上。,"In all Asian nations, under whatever regime, authority from above always reaches down and meets in some middle ground local self-government rising from below."
9767,很多人认为，这些变革除了破坏社会稳定和扰乱社会秩序之外别无他用。,"Such developments, it was argued, could only mean a weakening of social stability, a destabilizing of the social order."
9767,于是，本杰明•迪斯雷利所言之“两国”时代拉开了帷幕。文化格局的巨变甚至催生了新兴工人阶级的第一次大规模政治文化运动，即宪章运动。,"It marked the beginning of what Benjamin Disraeli would call the ""two nations"", and it eventually gave birth to the first political and cultural movement of the new urban working class – Chartism."
9767,正是这种情况及其带来的持续性后果，促使大众文化的政治研究开始肇兴。,"It is out of this context, and its continuing aftermath, which the political study of popular culture first emerges."
9768,从很多方面看，这都不是件易事。,"This is, in many ways, a daunting task."
9768,正如托尼•本内特（Tony Bennett)所指出的那样：“从当下情况看，‘大众文化’这一概念实在无用， 它似乎把若干混沌不清乃至彼此抵触的含义塞进一个大熔炉，只会将种种对真相的探索引入理论的死胡同。,"As Tony Bennett (1980) points out, ‘as it stands, the concept of popular culture is virtually useless, a melting pot of confused and contradictory meanings capable of misdirecting inquiry up any number of theoretical blind alleys’ (18)."
9768,”（Bennett，1980: 18)此种“界定困难”一部分源自“他者”（otherness)这一概念的特殊性--当我们使用 “大众文化”这一表述时，暗示着与大众文化相对的“他者”总是缺席/在场的。,Part of the difficulty stems from the implied otherness that is always absent/ present when we use the term ‘popular culture’.
9768,在阅读后面的章节时，你也会发现我们往往有意无意地将大众文化与其他文化——民间文化、群氓文化、宰制性文化、工人阶级文化等等——进行对比，并在对比中为“大众文化”下定义。,"As we shall see in the chapters which follow, popular culture is always defined, implicitly or explicitly, in contrast to other conceptual categories: folk culture, mass culture, dominant culture, working-class culture, etc."
9769,我们可以说通过引入这个概念，我们在提倡一种新的启发式原理。这强调另外一种新研究类型的绝对必要性。,"We might say that in introducing this concept, we are supplying a new heuristic  principle in laying stress on the absolute necessity for an additional type of research."
9769,这主要体现于考察某些机制、组织形式、习俗或观念如何在一方面扩大人类潜力的范围，而在另一方面又如何把某些限制加之于人类行为，简言之，功能论就是对于文化作为一个决定原理究竟为何物的考察。特别是把它作为向个人和集体生活标准提供的附加物的考察。,"This consists primarily in a consideration of how certain devices, forms of organization, customs, or ideas enlarge the range of human potentialities on the one hand, and impose certain restrictions on human behavior on the other.In short, functionalism is the consideration of what culture is as a determining principle, in terms of the addition which it provides to the individual and collective standard of living."
9770,让我们暂不考虑牛仔裤的功能性。,
9770,功能与文化几乎毫无 干系，因为文化关注的是意义、快感、身份认同，而不是功效。,"Let's dismiss their functionality first, for this has little to do with culture, which is concerned with meanings, pleasures, and identities rather than efficiency."
9770,当 然，牛仔裤是一种极为实用的服饰，它舒适、耐用，有时也很便 宜，并只需要“低度保养”（low maintenence)可是劳动服也有 这些特点。,"Of course jeans are a supremely functional garment, comfortable, tough, sometimes cheap, and requiring “low maintenance""—but so, too, are army fatigues."
9771,进化论与播化论的歧异——每种学说内部自然也有大量小学派和分歧的观点——看来是人类学方法和概念“装备”的主要分水岭。,"The rift between evolutionism and diffusionism—and each of them, of course, contains a number of partial schools and divergent opinions—still appears as the main dividing line in method and conceptual outfit."
9771,如今，这两派之外有时又加上功能学派（functional school)。本文作者常被认为是它的主要责任人。,"To these two, there is sometimes added at present the functional school, for which the present writer is often held to be largely responsible."
9771,但是，在现实中，在近距离审视的放大镜之下，我们就能看出更加多样化的倾向、理论和方法。每一派都以关于什么是真正解释原则的某种根本概念为特征；每一派都有它希望用以理解文化过程和产物的具体方法；每一派在进入田野时都带有一套略显不同的知识分类架构（pigeonholes)来收集和分装证据。,"In reality, however, and under the magnifying glass of closer scrutiny, we could find a much greater diversity of tendencies, theories, and methods, each characterized by some ultimate conception as to what is the real principle of interpretation; each having some specific approach through which it hopes to reach the comprehension of a cultural process or product; each going into the field with a somewhat differential set of intellectual pigeonholes into which to gather and distribute evidence."
9772,我们力图表明，有可能发展一套理论。该理论可将基本需求及其文化满足与新的文化需求的衍生挂钩。而且，这些新的文化需求又将一套次生型的决定机制强加于人与社会。,We shall attempt to show that a theory can be developed in which the basic needs and their cultural satisfaction can be linked up with the derivation of new cultural needs; that these new needs impose upon man and society a secondary type of determinism.
9772,我们将能把产生于诸如经济、道德、教育和政治等活动类型的功用性驱力 (instruimental imperatives)整合驱力（integrative imperatives) 区分开。,"We shall be able to distinguish between instrumental imperatives—arising out of such types of activity as economic, normative, educational and political—and integrative imperatives."
9772,后者可以知识、宗教和巫术为例。,"Here we shall list knowledge, religion, and magic."
9772,我们将能把艺术和娱乐活动与人类机体的特定生理特征直接联系，并表明它们对协作行为方式，对巫术、工业和宗教信仰等等的影响和依赖。,"Artistic and recreational activities we shall be able to relate directly to certain physiological characteristics of the human organism, and also to show their influence and dependence upon modes of concerted action, magical, industrial, and religious belief."
9773,让我用图表的形式来阐明这一点。,Let me present this in a diagrammatic form.
9773,下表列出了一连串的关键序列。,In the adjoining table a series of vital sequences are listed.
9773,每个序列都被分解为三个连贯的阶段。,Each of them has been analyzed into a tripartite concatenation of phases.
9774,此外，与此有关的是这一概念：在后现代状况下，越发难以把经济和通俗文化分开。,An aspect of this is the idea that in the postmodern condition it becomes more difficult to distinguish the economy from popular culture.
9774,"消费领域——我们购买什么和决定我们购买什么——正日益受到通俗文化的影响。消费与通俗文化的联系日益密切，因为通俗文化日益决定着消费，例如，我们能看到更多影片,是由于影碟机拥有量的扩大，而广告则日益利用通俗文化的各种参照物，在决定我们购买什么方面起着一种更加重要的作用。","Consumption—what we buy and what determines what we buy—is increasingly influenced by popular culture because popular culture increasingly determines consumption.For example, we watch more films because of the extended ownership of VCRs, while advertising, which makes increasing use of popular cultural references, plays a more important role in deciding what we will buy."
9775,显然，这两种分析方案中的任何一种都并不意味着所有文化是相同的也不意味着文化研究者必须对身份、文化的一致性或相似性投入比其对于文化的差异性更多的兴趣。,"Obviously, neither of these two schemes of analysis implies that all cultures are identical, nor yet that the student of culture must be more interested in identities or similarities than he is in differences."
9775,然而我主张，要理解各种歧异，一种清晰，共同的比较尺度必不可少。,"I submit, however, that in order to understand divergencies, a clear, common measure of comparison is indispensable."
9775,此外，这也可能证明，通常被归因于不同民族或部落特殊天才的多数歧异，持有此说者并不只限于国家社会主义理论——乃是种种制度围绕某些高度专门化的需求和价值而形成的理由。,"It will, moreover, be possible to demonstrate that most of the divergencies which are often attributed to specific national or tribal genius—and that not only in the theory of National Socialism—are the reason for institutions organized around some highly specialized need or value."
9776,在一次学术会议上，我听到一位与会者声称李维斯牛仔裤绝不可能采用果酱乐队的歌来为自己的产品促销。,"At a conference I once attended, a contribution from the floor suggested that Levi jeans would never be able to use a song from The Jam to sell its products."
9776,尽管事实上李维斯早已采用了撞击乐队的音乐做过广告歌，但这些人仍然固执己见。,The fact that they had already used a song by The Clash would not shake this conviction.
9776,在这种偏见背后，是对文化差异的捍卫——李维斯牛仔裤的电视广告是群氓文化，而果酱乐队的音乐是由“人民”创造出来的一种对抗性的大众文化，后者绝不应该为前者服务，除非果酱乐队背弃自己的信仰。,"What underpinned this conviction was a clear sense of cultural difference--television commercials for Levi jeans are mass culture, the music of The Jam is popular culture defined as an oppositional culture of ‘the people’.The only way the two could meet would be through The Jam‘selling out’."
9777,在本章中，我将对“种族”这个概念，以及种族主义在英国的历史变迁进行一番考察。,In this chapter I will examine the concept of ‘race’ and the historical development of racism in England.
9777,此外，我还会就一种特殊的种族表征政体，即爱德华•萨义德的东方主义展开讨论。,"I will then explore a particular regime of racial representation, Edward Said’s analysis of Orientalism."
9777,作为大众文化中的东方主义案例，我将分析好莱坞关于越南战争的种种表述及其对第一次海湾战争的征兵活动产生的潜在影响。,"I will use Hollywood’s account of America’s war in Vietnam, and its potential impact on recruitment for the first Gulf War as an example of Orientalism in popular culture."
9777,本章的末尾将以对文化研究与反种族主义的扼要讨论作结。,The chapter will conclude with a brief discussion of cultural studies and anti-racism.
9778,“后马克思主义”这个概念至少有两种含义。,Post-Marxism can mean at least two things.
9778,"欧内斯托·拉克劳和尚塔尔·墨菲合著之《霸权与社会主义战略：通向激进民主政治之路》对后马克思主义产生了深远的影响。在书中，作者指出：“如果说本书的主题是""后马克思主义""的，那它同时也必然是""后马克思主义""的。”","As Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe point out in their deeply influential contribution to post-Marxism, Hegemony and Socialist Strategy: Towards a Radical Democratic Politics, ""if our intellectual project in this book is post-Marxist, it is evidently also post-Marxist"" (4)."
9779,这些元素究竟是如何被接合的？这在一定程度上取决于进行文化生产及消费的社会语境和历史条件。,How these elements are articulated will depend in part on the social circumstances and historical conditions of production and consumption.
9779,霍尔以威廉斯的观点为基础，建构了一套“受众立场”的理论。他认为，受众在解读文本时，有“主导式”、“协商式”和“屈从式”三种立场（Hall，1980a)。,"Hall (1980a) uses Williams’s insight to construct a theory of reading positions: ‘subordinate’, ‘dominant’, and ‘negotiated’."
9779,大卫•莫利（David Morley)对这一理论作出了修正，充分重视了话语 (discourse)和主观性因素：受众对文本的解读始终是文本话语与受众话语之间进行的互动行为（Moriey，1980)。,David Morley (1980) has modified the model to take into account discourse and subjectivity: seeing reading as always an interaction between the discourses of the text and the discourses of the reader.

9781,如果列出世界上各种文化的所有表现，我们就会明显地发现一系列详尽的边缘古怪习俗：如食人之风（cannibalism)、猎头、 产翁制（couvade)、夸富宴（potlatch)、库拉圈（kula)、火葬(cremation)、木乃伊（mummification)等。,"Were we to plot out all the manifestations of every culture in the world, we obviously would find such elements as cannibalism, head-hunting, couvade, potlatch, kula, cremation, mummification, and a vast array of detailed peripheral eccentricities."
9781,就此而论，显然没有单一的文化能够包罗许多其他文化中的所有形式的畸形和怪癖。,From this point of view obviously no single culture covers all the itemized freaks and eccentricities of many others.
9781,然而我要说，这种研究方法在本质上是不科学的。,"Yet this approach, I submit, is essentially unscientific."
9782,卡莱尔在这个领域中博览群书，论述广泛，谈诺瓦里斯的论文与《时代的征兆》同年写成， 是其中的一个例子，他们的关系由此可昭然若揭。,"Carlyle had already read and written widely in this field, and the essay on Novalis, for example, written in the same year as Signs of the Times, shows evident relations to it."
9782,关干机械思考与动力思考(mechanic and dynamic thinking)之对比的一段引文正是出自他正在评论《诺瓦里斯作品》第二卷中的《杂论》之中，这又是一例。,"The contrast of mechanical and dynamic thinking is there, for instance, in a quotation from the Fragments in the second volume of the Novalis Schriften which he was reviewing."
9782,还有其他许多观念、片言只语，也同样可以在这些德国影响中追根溯源。,"Many of the other ideas, and phrases, may be similarly traced."
9783,不过，完全撇开商品拜物教理论，马克思对于意识形态在资本主义社会的整个结构中的地位，似乎也具有一种独特的和决定论的看法。,"However, apart from the theory of commodity fetishism, Marx appears to have had a further and more deterministic theory about the place of ideology in the structure of capitalist societies."
9783,这就是众所周知的基础—上层建筑模式。,This is commonly known as the base— superstructure model.
9783,一个社会的基础是其物质生产的方式，通常是各种经济的方式，社会借此从物质上再生产自己，它也是剥削阶级关系的来源。,"The base of a society is its mode of material production, the economic system by which it reproduces itself, and the source of exploitative class relations."
9783,基础决定一个社会的上层建筑，决定它的政治和意识形态制度、社会关系和一系列在基础之外的观念，如家庭、国家、宗教、教育和文化。,"It determines the superstructure of a society, its political and ideological institutions, the social relations and sets of ideas that lie outside the base such as the family, the state, religion, education and culture."
9784,在基督教社会主义运动中，骚赛与欧文的影响清晰可见。,"In a movement like Christian Socialism, the influence of both Southey and Owen can be clearly discerned."
9784,然而，欧文的主要方向导致社会主义与合作社，骚塞则与伯克和科尔律治走向新的保守主义。,"Yet Owen, in his main bearings, led to socialism and the cooperatives; Southey, with Burke and Coleridge, to the new conservatism."
9784,而且，骚塞在新保守主义中亦并非次要角色；举个例子，斯迈思举例说明了《对话论》是年轻的英国观念的主要来源，又称骚塞是“这个运动的真正创造者”。,"Southey's part in the latter movement, moreover, was no minor one; Smythe, for example, instanced the Colloquies as a main source of the ideas of Young England, and called Southey 'the real founder of the movement'."
9785,极权主义社会，以及自由民主政治，已被看成是大众社会的典型。,"Totalitarian societies, along with liberal democracies, have been viewed as types of mass society."
9785,大众社会的概念已构成了关于大众媒介和大众文化在现代资本主义社会中的作用的一种重要看法。在英国和美国那样的社会中，正是知识分子对他们所认为的大众社会和大众文化崛起的担忧与焦虑，才形成和激发了对这些发展的争论。,"The concept of mass society has formed one important perspective on the role of mass media and mass culture in modern capitalist societies.It has been the fears and anxieties of intellectuals, in societies such as Britain and America, about the rise of what they have seen as a mass society and a mass culture which have served to organise and inform the debates about these developments."
9786,费边社的集体主义的道路被坚决地抛弃：它从未自认为是一种艺术的理想。,The Fabian road of collectivism is firmly rejected: It never presumed to be an artistic ideal.
9786,它最后甚至不敢自认为是人类的理想。,It has ended in not even daring to be a human one.
9786,反社会主义者说，社会主义不注意人性，是言之有理的。,The Anti-Socialist who told us that Socialism left human nature out of account stands justified.
9787,人类学家一方面信奉所有种族，白种、棕种和黑种人的权利，以及所有少数民族享受同等待遇的权利；同时他也有保守的偏见，这使他承认传统的价值、文化多样性的价值，无论是一种文化自身还是多种文化交汇（cross-fertilization)。,"The anthropologist believes, on the one hand, in the right of all races, white, brown and black, and in the right of all minorities to equal treatment.He also has the conservative bias which makes him recognize the value of tradition, the value of the diversity of cultures, in their independence as well as in their cross-fertilization."
9787,他的忠告是：不能用武力、财力和法律强制力把我们的文化强加于其他文化。,"His advice would be that our culture must not be imposed on others by the force of arms, the power of wealth, and the stringency of law."
9787,一厢情愿式的传教士精神至少应该节制。,"The missionary spirit in the crudest form will have to be modified, at least."
9788,结构主义的两个基本观点都来自索绪尔的语言学。,Structuralism takes two basic ideas from Saussure's work.
9788,第一，关注文本与实践之中包含的基本关系，以及使意义得以生成的语法”；第二，始终认为意义是在词句组合与选择的相互关系和影响中形成的，决定性因素则是潜藏的结构。,"First, a concern with the underlying relations of texts and practices, the ""grammar"" that makes meaning possible.Second, the view that meaning is always the result of the interplay of relationships of selection and combination made possible by the underlying structure."
9788,换言之，结构主义者将文本与实践当作语言来研究。,"In other words, texts and practices are studied as analogous to language."
9789,休闲娱乐带给工人们的并不是“再创造”(再创造劳动中失去的东西），而是“创造无力”(劳动过程中失去的东西的混合体）。,"Therefore, instead of recreation (re-creating what is lost in work), leisure provides workers with only 'decreation' (a compounding of the loss experienced through work)."
9789,情况如此，难怪人们会向群氓文化寻求情感补偿和被动娱乐。毒品开始大行其道，每个人都成了沉溺于“生活替代品”中的瘾君子。,"Given such a situation, it is little wonder that people turn to mass culture for compensation and passive distraction; the drug habit develops and they become junkies addicted to ‘substitute living’."
9789,田园牧歌的世界不复存在，取而代之的是乏味平庸的“近郊主义”（suburbanism) (99)。,A world of rural rhythms has been lost to the monotony and mediocrity of ‘suburbanism’ (99).
9789,在有机社区里，日常文化源源不断地为个体提供健康的养料；而在大众文明之中，每个人都必须时刻保持清醒，抵御日常文化产生的恶劣影响。,"Whereas in the organic community everyday culture was a constant support to the health of the individual, in mass civilization one must make a conscious and directed effort to avoid the unhealthy influence of everyday culture."
9789,"至于威廉斯所言之“在日常文化之中，同样存在着贫穷、卑鄙的专制、疾病与死亡、无知与气馁""（Williams，1963: 253)，利维斯们则完全无视。","The Leavisites fail to mention, as Williams (1963) remarks, ‘the penury, the petty tyranny, the disease and mortality, the ignorance and frustrated intelligence which were also among its ingredients’ (253)."
9790,后现代文化之所以尽失历史性，与詹明信所归纳的第二种风格特征密切相关，即“精神分裂症”。,"The failure to be historical relates to a second stylistic feature identified by Jameson, cultural ""schizophrenia""."
9790,这一表述来自拉康，意指语言的失序与能指之间时态关系的错乱。,"He uses the term in the sense developed by Lacan  to signify a language disorder, a failure of the temporal relationship between signifiers."
9790,在“精神分裂症”的作用下，时间并非不间断的连续体（过去-现在-未来），而是一个周而复始的在场，只有在过去或某种未来的可能性的侵人之下，方可显现自身。,"The schizophrenic experiences time not as a continuum (past–present– future), but as a perpetual present that is only occasionally marked by the intrusion of the past or the possibility of a future."
9791,而我们第一次有意识地察觉到自己乃是一个独立的个体，发生于拉康所言之“镜像阶段”。,"Our sense of being a unique individual only begins to emerge in what Lacan calls ‘the mirror stage’.As Lacan points out, we are all born prematurely."
9791,他指出，所有人都是早产的婴儿，需要花时间学会控制与协调自己的行动；而只有当婴儿第一次在镜子中看到自己的影像（大约在出生后6到18个月期间）时，这一过程才算正式完成。,It takes time to be able to control and coordinate our movements.This has not been fully accomplished when the infant first sees itself in a mirror (between the ages of 6 and 18 months).
9791,尽管婴儿“仍然处于行动不便且必须依靠哺乳存活的状态中”，但却在瞥见镜中影像的那一刻形成了某种认同感。,"The infant, ‘still sunk in his motor incapacity and nursling dependence’, forms an identification with the image in the mirror."
9792,因此，它并不像我们刚开始讨论人的研究的科学方法时显现的那样无用、无聊和自命不凡，而是现代和未来人类学对整个人文学科做出的真正贡献。,"Thus, it is not as futile, jejune, and presumptuous as it might first appear to discuss the scientific approach to the Study of Man as the real contribution of modern and future anthropology to humanism as a whole."
9792,我们需要一种文化理论，一种关于文化的过程和产物，一神关于它的特殊决定论、一种关于它与人类心理的基本事实和发生在人体内部的有机现象之间的关系，以及社会对于环境的依赖的理论。这种理论当然不是人类学家的专利。,"We need a theory of culture, of its processes and products, of its specific determinism, of its relation to basic facts of human psychology and the organic happenings within the human body, and of the dependence of society upon the environment.Such a theory is by no means the monopoly of the anthropologist."
9793,“葛兰西派”的学者认为，大众文化是一个富含冲突的场所。在这里，被统治集团之“抵抗”力量与统治集团利益对被统治集团的“收编”力量进行着斗争。,Those using this approach see popular culture as a site of struggle between the ‘resistance’ of subordinate groups and the forces of ‘incorporation’ operating in the interests of dominant groups.
9793,大众文化既不是理论家自上而下灌输给“群氓”的文化，也不是自下而上的、由“人民”创造的对抗性文化，而是两者进行交流和协商的场域，同时包括了“抵抗”与“收编”。,"Popular culture in this usage is not the imposed culture of the mass culture theorists, nor is it an emerging from below, spontaneously oppositional culture of ‘the people’ – it is a terrain of exchange and negotiation between the two: a terrain, as already stated, marked by resistance and incorporation."
9793,大众文化的文本与实践就在葛兰西所谓的“均势妥协”（compromise equilibrium)中流动（1971 : 161 )。,The texts and practices of popular culture move within what Gramsci (1971) calls a ‘compromise equilibrium’ (161).
9793,这一过程既是历时性的（在某一时期被贴上“大众文化”标签的文化，在另一时期也许就成了其他文化），又是共时性的（无论在哪个特定的历史时期，大众文化都在“抵抗”与“收编”之间游弋）。,"The process is historical (labelled popular culture one moment, and another kind of culture the next), but it is also synchronic (moving between resistance and incorporation at any given historical moment)."
9793,例如，海滨休假一度是贵族的特权，如今却成了大众文化的范例。,"For instance, the seaside holiday began as an aristocratic event and within a hundred years it had become an example of popular culture."
9794,这些研究可以追溯到仍处于石器时代的文化。在中国和印度、西亚和埃及的古老文明中，它们当然早已兴盛。,"Such contributions can be traced back to cultures still perpetuating the Stone Age; they certainly have flourished in the old civilizations of China and India, of Western Asia and Egypt."
9794,经济学和法学、政治科学和美学、语言学、考古学和比较宗教研究，则是后来加人到人文学科中的新内容。,"Economics and jurisprudence, political science and aesthetics, linguistics, archaeology, and the comparative study of religions, constitute a more recent addition to humanism."
9794,约两个世纪前，研究人类心智的心理学，随后又有探究人类关系的社会学，被列人正式的学术研究名录。,"Some two centuries ago psychology, the study of the mind, and later on, sociology, an inquiry into human relations, were added to the list of official academic studies."
9795,如果列出世界上各种文化的所有表现，我们就会明显地发现一系列详尽的边缘古怪习俗：如食人之风（cannibalism)、猎头、 产翁制（couvade)、夸富宴（potlatch)、库拉圈（kula)、火葬(cremation)、木乃伊（mummification)等。,"Were we to plot out all the manifestations of every culture in the world, we obviously would find such elements as cannibalism, head-hunting, couvade, potlatch, kula, cremation, mummification, and a vast array of detailed peripheral eccentricities."
9795,就此而论，显然没有单一的文化能够包罗许多其他文化中的所有形式的畸形和怪癖。,From this point of view obviously no single culture covers all the itemized freaks and eccentricities of many others.
9795,然而我要说，这种研究方法在本质上是不科学的。,"Yet this approach, I submit, is essentially unscientific."
9796,如果列出世界上各种文化的所有表现，我们就会明显地发现一系列详尽的边缘古怪习俗：如食人之风（cannibalism)、猎头、 产翁制（couvade)、夸富宴（potlatch)、库拉圈（kula)、火葬(cremation)、木乃伊（mummification)等。,"Were we to plot out all the manifestations of every culture in the world, we obviously would find such elements as cannibalism, head-hunting, couvade, potlatch, kula, cremation, mummification, and a vast array of detailed peripheral eccentricities."

9796,然而我要说，这种研究方法在本质上是不科学的。,"Yet this approach, I submit, is essentially unscientific."
9797,有关男性气质的意识形态让男人别无选择。,The ideology of masculinity left men no choice.
9797,他们的选择是被迫的，或者失败的。,Their options were oppression or failure.
9797,他们觉得，那两个因妻子没有回答“好，老公”而被当众“拆穿”的丈夫，要比另外两个顺从丈夫的妻子，受到更大的困窘。,"They felt that the embarrassment of the two husbands whose wives ""showed them up"" in public by not answering ""Yes, master"" was greater than that of the compliant wives who did."
9798,它普遍存在于最原始的文化直至我们现代的西方文明。在此前提下，人生的某些阶段被划定出来。而对应于这些阶段，人们对社会环境的依赖又有不同：婴儿期和一定程度的儿童期；从训练和学习期；介于性成熟和婚姻之间的青春期；部落的正式成员期（full tribal membership);以及最后的老年阶段。,"It is universal from the most primitive culture up to our modern Western civilization, in that certain stages of human life are marked out, and to these stages there correspond periods of complete dependence upon the social milieu, as in infancy and, to a certain extent, in childhood; the period of training and learning; the period of adolescence as between sexual maturity and marriage; the period of full tribal membership; and finally, the stage of senility."
9798,最后这个阶段可能会对部落或民族事务产生重要影响，因此民族志还专门有个杜撰词汇，叫老人政治（gerontocracy);但这一阶段也可能仅仅意味着老年男、女实际上处于部落生活主流之外，单调地打发时日而已。,"This latter may either be associated with great influence in tribal or national affairs, for which an ethnographic word, gerontocracy, has been coined; or else it simply means that old men and old women are allowed to vegetate virtually outside the full current of tribal life."
9798,"在一些文化中，体质或精神变态者如性倒错（sexual inversion)、癲痫或歇斯底理倾向，成为构成群体组织的基础，有时与萨满教相关,有时则部分地形成法外族(outlawed caste) 。","In some cultures physical and mental abnormalities, such as sexual inversion or epileptic or hysterical tendencies, form the basis of group organization, at times connected with shamanism, at times constituting a partially outlawed caste."
9799,利维斯主义的影响力大约持续了40年。,The work of Leavisism spans a period of some forty years.
9799,"不过，“利维斯派”关于大众文化的观点却是在20世纪30年代早期形成的，总计有三部代表性著作：利维斯的《大众文明与少数人文化》、利维斯的《小说与阅读公众》（利维斯的妻子,与其夫同为著名文学批评家,后人习惯称之为“利维斯夫人”）以及利维斯与丹尼斯•汤普森合著的《文化与环境》。","However, the Leavisite attitude to popular culture was formed in the early 1930s with the publication of three texts: Mass Civilisation and Minority Culture, by F.R. Leavis, Fiction and the Reading Public, by Q.D. Leavis and Culture and Environment, by F.R. Leavis and Denys Thompson."
9799,正是这三部著作为利维斯主义的大众文化研究奠定了基调。,Together these form the basis of the Leavisite response to popular culture.
9800,对意识形态的社会决定因素的研究，目前主要有两种方法：利益论与张力论。,There are currently two main approaches to the study of the social determinants of ideology: the interest theory and the strain theory.
9800,对前者而言，意识形态是面具和武器；对后者而言，意识形态是症状及处方。,"For the first, ideology is a mask and a weapon; for the second, a symptom and a remedy."
9800,在利益论中，意识形态见解被置于为好处进行的普遍斗争的背景之中；在张力论中，则被看成是为纠正社会心理的不平衡而进行的长期努力。,"In the interest theory, ideological pronouncements are seen against the background of a universal struggle for advantage; in the strain theory, against the background of a chronic effort to correct sociopsychological disequilibrium."
9801,"库宁海姆（Cunningham,1982)告诉我们，在整个19世纪，中产阶级是怎样一以贯之地将他们的精神风尚与组织形式，强加在体育运动上。",Cunningham (1982) shows how consistently throughout the nineteenth century the middle classes attempted to impose their ethos and forms of organization upon sport.
9801,譬如足球与板球，是从它们大众的、无秩序的起源那里“偷”来的，并被重新组织而变得体面，再被转化为塑造年青绅士的品质乃至民族国家的性格的手段。,"Football and cricket, for instance, were ""stolen"" from their popular, disorderly origins, and were organized, made respectable, and turned into the means of building the character of young gentlemen, and thus of the nation."
9801,这种策略，同其他所有的控制策略-样，只在某方面成功，其相对的失败之处在于，体育运动乃沿着阶级的界线分裂开来。,"This strategy, like all strategies of control, was successful only up to a point, and its comparative failure is evidenced by the way sport split along class lines."
9801,替如业余英式橄榄球（rugby union)的参与者是一群绅士，而联盟制橄榄球（rugby league)的球员则是出身工人阶级的职业选手。,"Rugby union, for instance, became the form played by gentlemen amateurs, rugby league by working-class professionals."
9802,如果列出世界上各种文化的所有表现，我们就会明显地发现一系列详尽的边缘古怪习俗：如食人之风（cannibalism)、猎头、 产翁制（couvade)、夸富宴（potlatch)、库拉圈（kula)、火葬(cremation)、木乃伊（mummification)等。,"Were we to plot out all the manifestations of every culture in the world, we obviously would find such elements as cannibalism, head-hunting, couvade, potlatch, kula, cremation, mummification, and a vast array of detailed peripheral eccentricities."
9802,就此而论，显然没有单一的文化能够包罗许多其他文化中的所有形式的畸形和怪癖。,From this point of view obviously no single culture covers all the itemized freaks and eccentricities of many others.
9802,然而我要说，这种研究方法在本质上是不科学的。,"Yet this approach, I submit, is essentially unscientific."
9803,弗雷泽自己提出的解决方案是：诸如婚姻、法律、财产和政府这些制度确实“满足了现实的人类需要”。,"The solution is indicated by Frazer himself.Such institutions as marriage, or law, or property, or government do ""answer real human needs."""
9803,如果弗雷泽更充分地探询这些需求的本质，他就可能最早地向我们提出了人类制度和人类文化的法律、政府、经济和社会组织等方面的真文“起源”的正确理论。,"Had Frazer inquired more fully into the nature of those needs, he might have, first and foremost, given us a correct theory of the real ""origins"" of human institutions and of such aspects of human culture as law, government, economics, and social organization."
9803,他早就会发现从最早的开端延续至今的人类组织的某些形态如家庭、亲属关系、地缘群体或领地群体(municipality)以及国家等，乃是与组织化人类生活的明确需求相对应的。,"He would have discovered that forms of human organization which have endured from the very beginnings till our times, such as the family, kinship, the local group or municipality, and the state, correspond to definite needs of organized human life."
9803,然后他就可以证明，并且是确凿和充分地证明：巫术和宗教的某些形式何以有助于协调人类活动和人类集群在某些方面的持续和发展。,"He could then show, and show convincingly and adequately, why certain forms of magic and religion have contributed towards the permanence and the development of certain aspects of concerted human activities and of human groupings."
9804,这种轮换历法是到目前为止最为重要的。,The permutational calendar is by far the most important.
9804,它由十个不同的日期名称的周期组成。,It consists of ten different cycles of daynames.
9804,这些周期的长度不同。,These cycles are of varying lengths.
9804,最长的一个周期有十个日期名称，根据固定的顺序依次相随，顺序轮完之后第一个日期名称再次出现，这个周期又开始。,"The longest contains ten day-names, following one another in a fixed order, after which the first day-name reappears and the cycle starts over."
9805,这种哲学在日本是看不到的。,Such philosophy is alien in Japan.
9805,尽管日本是一个佛教大国，但轮回和涅槃的思想从未成为日本人民佛教信仰的一部分。,"Even though Japan is a great Buddhist nation, ideas of transmigration and of nirvana have never been a part of the Buddhist faith of the people."
9805,虽有少数僧侣接受这种教义，但从未影响过民间的思想和习俗。,"These doctrines are personally accepted by some Buddhist priests, but they have never affected folkways or popular thought."
9806,马克思主义（Marxism)是一个艰深复杂且颇具争议的体系，绝不仅仅是一套旨在改天换地的革命理论。,Marxism is a difficult and contentious body of work.But it is also more than this: it is a body of revolutionary theory with the purpose of changing the world.
9806,马克思本人有句名言：“哲学家们只是 用不同方式解释世界，问题在于改变世界。”（Marx，1976b: 65),"As Marx (1976b) famously said: ‘The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point is to change it’ (65)."
9807,大众的快感以两种主要的方式运作：躲避（或冒犯）与生产力。,The work of popular pleasure takes two main forms: evasion (or offensiveness) and productivity.
9807,大众快感的抵抗活动在不同的形式中.,Its resistances are practiced differently in each form.
9807,，有不同的实践方式。将大众的快感进行这样的分类时，我们必须牢记，这仅仅是一种分析策略；而大众的快感只存在于它具体的实践、语境与生产的时刻，因此，大多数大众的快感都规避了槪括与理论所呼吁的那种结构化倾向,"In categorizing its work in such a way, we must remember that this is an analytical strategy only; popular pleasure exists only in its practices, contexts, and moments of production, and thus much of it escapes the sort of structuring that generalization and theory call for."
9808,除了少数“摩登”人物之外，一般良家子弟的婚姻对象都要由父母通过媒人来选择。,"Except in 'modan' (modern) circles it is taken for granted in respectable families that the parents select their son's wife, usually through the good offices of go-betweens."
9808,关心挑选一个好媳妇的，不是儿子本人，而是他的家庭。其原因不仅是涉及金钱，主要是因为那媳妇将载入家谱，生出男孩，传宗接代。,"The family, not the son, is chiefly concerned about the matter of a good selection, not only because of the money transactions involved but because the wife will be entered in the family genealogy and will perpetuate the family line through her sons."
9809,从很多方面看，这都不是件易事。,"This is, in many ways, a daunting task."
9809,正如托尼•本内特（Tony Bennett)所指出的那样：“从当下情况看，‘大众文化’这一概念实在无用， 它似乎把若干混沌不清乃至彼此抵触的含义塞进一个大熔炉，只会将种种对真相的探索引入理论的死胡同。,"As Tony Bennett (1980) points out, ‘as it stands, the concept of popular culture is virtually useless, a melting pot of confused and contradictory meanings capable of misdirecting inquiry up any number of theoretical blind alleys’ (18)."
9809,”（Bennett，1980: 18)此种“界定困难”一部分源自“他者”（otherness)这一概念的特殊性--当我们使用 “大众文化”这一表述时，暗示着与大众文化相对的“他者”总是缺席/在场的。,Part of the difficulty stems from the implied otherness that is always absent/ present when we use the term ‘popular culture’.
9809,在阅读后面的章节时，你也会发现我们往往有意无意地将大众文化与其他文化——民间文化、群氓文化、宰制性文化、工人阶级文化等等——进行对比，并在对比中为“大众文化”下定义。,"As we shall see in the chapters which follow, popular culture is always defined, implicitly or explicitly, in contrast to other conceptual categories: folk culture, mass culture, dominant culture, working-class culture, etc."
9810,他的忠告是：不能用武力、财力和法律强制力把我们的文化强加于其他文化。,"His advice would be that our culture must not be imposed on others by the force of arms, the power of wealth, and the stringency of law."
9810,一厢情愿式的传教士精神至少应该节制。,"The missionary spirit in the crudest form will have to be modified, at least."
9810,在保守反应和每个民族认识到自身文化的整合价值的意义上，民族主义正如火如荼地传遍整个世界。,"Nationalism, in the sense of a conservative reaction and the recognition of the integral value of its own culture by each nation, is spreading like wildfire all over the world."
9810,作为白人种族的成员，我们对此负有主要责任。我们一直在向其他种族和民族施舍我们的宗教、我们的教育和许多其他精神恩惠，并带着一个含蓄的承诺：一但他们接受了我们的文明，就能与我们平起平坐。,"We, the members of the white race, are primarily responsible for that, and we have been giving our religion, our education, and many other spiritual boons to other races and other peoples, with an implied promise that once they accept our civilization they will become our equals."
9810,这个许诺没有兑现。,This promise has not been redeemed.
9811,如果列出世界上各种文化的所有表现，我们就会明显地发现一系列详尽的边缘古怪习俗：如食人之风（cannibalism)、猎头、 产翁制（couvade)、夸富宴（potlatch)、库拉圈（kula)、火葬(cremation)、木乃伊（mummification)等。,"Were we to plot out all the manifestations of every culture in the world, we obviously would find such elements as cannibalism, head-hunting, couvade, potlatch, kula, cremation, mummification, and a vast array of detailed peripheral eccentricities."
9811,就此而论，显然没有单一的文化能够包罗许多其他文化中的所有形式的畸形和怪癖。,From this point of view obviously no single culture covers all the itemized freaks and eccentricities of many others.
9811,然而我要说，这种研究方法在本质上是不科学的。,"Yet this approach, I submit, is essentially unscientific."
9812,如尼古拉斯·马克斯韦尔所建议的：如果我们对科学的目的作出一种决定性的假设的话，那么某些范式和理论甚至在它们的实质结果被检验之前就能得到评价的这种决定性假设是，科学的总目标就是要发现宇宙中或任何一种探讨领域中固有的最大数目的秩序。,"As Nicholas Maxwell (1974a, 1974b) has suggested, if we make one crucial assumption about the purpose of science, then the possibility arises that some paradigms and theories can be evaluated even prior to the examination of their substantiveproducts.This one crucial assumption is that the overall aim of science is to discover the maximum amount of order inherent in the universe or in any field of inquiry."
9812,马克斯韦尔称此为“目标定向经验论”。,Maxwell calls this “aim-oriented empiricism.
9812,范式把它的目标简单定在发现上，而不承担任何义务去找出有秩序的关系，这比起其竞争者来就会被断定为非科学的或至少是不太科学的。,""" Paradigms that aim simply at discovering what’s there without any commitment to discovering orderly relationships would then be judged unscientific or at least less scientific than their competitors."
9812,相同的标准可以广泛应用于理论和假设。,This same criterion would be applicable to theories and hypotheses.
9813,比如说，“男性气质”是一种物质存在，我们也习惯于认为“男性气质”是一种“生物学”的特征；但实际上，在文化中有许多不同的方式来展示男性气质，来表达“什么才是有男性气质的”。,"For example, masculinity has real material conditions of existence, which we think of as ‘biological’, but there are different ways of representing masculinity in culture, different ways of ‘being masculine’."
9813,而且，这些展示与表达的方式大多不尽相同，很难确定哪一种是“真实的”或“正常的”。,"Moreover, these different ways do not all carry the same claims to ‘authenticity’ and ‘normality’."
9813,故而，尽管“男性气质”在物质上是一种生物学的存在，但“男性气质”的意义，以及人们抢夺意义的解释权的争斗，却永远存在于文化领域中。,"Masculinity, therefore, may depend on biological conditions of existence, but what it means, and the struggle over what it means, always takes place in culture."
9813,这并不是语义差异的问题，并不是对关于世界的不同阐释的简单比较，而是关涉文化与权力的关系，是一场决定究竞谁有权对社会现实加以定义的斗争。文化所关注的，就是如何以特定的方式使世界（以及世界上的存在之物）有意义。,This is not a question of semantic difference--a simple question of interpreting the world differently--it is about relations of culture and power; about who can claim the power and authority to define social reality; to make the world (and the things in it) mean in particular ways.
9814,意识形态的第四个定义与法国文化理论家罗兰•巴尔特（Roland Barthes)的早期作品有密切关联（在第六章会详细讨论）。,A fourth definition of ideology is one associated with the early work of the French cultural theorist Roland Barthes (discussed in more detail in Chapter 6).
9814,巴尔特指出，意识形态（巴尔特本人称之为“神话”）主要在内涵（connotation)层面上发挥作用，是文本或实践所承载或可能承载的、间接的、常常是无意识的含义。,"Barthes argues that ideology (or ‘myth’ as Barthes himself calls it) operates mainly at the level of connotations, the secondary, often unconscious meanings that texts and practices carry, or can be made to carry."
9814,例如，英国保守党在1990年制作播出了一期政治宣传节目，节目结束时的最后一个词是“社会主义”，而此时电视上出现了红色监狱栅栏的影像，这就暗示其竞争对手工党所鼓吹的社会主义无异于建造了社会、经济与政治的囹圄。,"For example, a Conservative Party political broadcast transmitted in 1990 ended with the word ‘socialism’ being transposed into red prison bars.What was being suggested is that the socialism of the Labour Party is synonymous with social, economic and political imprisonment."
9815,在后来的一部著作《符号学的诸要素》中，巴特通过划分外延和内涵之间的差别，重新推敲了他对能指、所指和神话之间关系的理解。,"In a later work, Elements of Semiology, Barthes refined his understanding of the relationship between the signifier, the signified and myth by drawing a distinction between denotation and connotation."
9815,在一个层面上，各神通俗文化符号的意义是自明的。,"On one level, the meaning of popular cultural signs is self-evident."
9815,它们是它们本身的样子或者它们显现的样子，一则广告，一幅黑人士兵的照片，一束玫瑰花等等。,"They are what they are or what they appear to be, an advert, a photo of a black soldier, a bunch of roses and so on."
9816,在与异文化的人打交道时，使用短路的“移情”（empathy)，即猜想其他人会有什么思想和感受，总是比较危险的。,"In dealing with people of a different culture, it is always dangerous to use the short-circuiting of ""empathy,"" which usually amounts to guessing as to what the other person might have thought or felt."
9816,实地工作者和行为论者的基本原理都认为观念、感情、意欲无论有意识或无意识，都不会在深不可测的心灵之内形成神秘和隐藏的存在。,"The fundamental principle of the field-worker, as well as of the behaviorist, is that ideas, emotions and conations never continue to lead a cryptical, hidden existence within the unexplorable depths of the mind, conscious or unconscious."
9816,所有可靠的，亦即实验的心理学都只能对外显的行为进行观察，虽然将这种观察与简单的内省解释（introspective interpretation)联系起来或许也不无用处。,"All sound, that is, experimental psychology can deal only with observations of overt behavior, although it may be useful to relate such observations to the shorthand of introspective interpretation."
9817,文化唯物主义理论把这些过程想象为狩猎—采集的成本一效益相对于农业和饲养家裔的成本—效益的根本转变。,Cultural materialist theories envision these processes as fundamental shifts in the cost-benefits of hunting-gathering as opposed to the cost-benefits of farming and stock raising.
9817,这些转变可能与标志着大约13，000年以前存在的间冰期开始的全球性气候变化有关。,"These shifts were probably related to the global imatological changes marking the onset of the present interglacial period about 13,000 yearsago."
9817,这一全球规模的事件为农业体系的同时出现提供了解释。,The global scale of this event provides an explanation for the simultaneous emergence of agricultural systems.
9817,其作用在不同的生态带的差异说明了导致新石器时代世界不同地区转交类型的差异。,And the diversity of its effects in different ecozones accounts for the diversity of scenarios leading to neolithic types of transitions in different parts of the world.
9818,在书中，作者指出：“如果说本书的主题是‘后马克思主义’的，那它同时也必然是‘后马克思主义’的。,
9818,”前者意味着超越马克思主义，去寻找一套更好的理论体系；而后者则主张对马克思主义进行修正，用女性主义、后现代主义、后结构主义和拉康精神分析学说等前沿理论成果来丰富马克思主义的内涵。,"To be post-Marxist is to leave behind Marxism for something better, whereas to be post-Marxist is to seek to transform Marxism, by adding to it recent theoretical developments from, especially, feminism, postmodernism, post-structuralism and Lacanian psychoanalysis."
9818,拉克劳和墨菲更多地属于“后马克思主义”而非“后马克思主义”，他们促进了马克思主义与“新女性主义、种族抗议运动、少数民族与反性别歧视运动、由社会边缘群体发动的反体制的生态斗争、反对核扩散运动以及外围资本主义国家发生的非典型社会斗争”之间的结合。,"Laclau and Mouffe are more post-Marxist than they are post-Marxist.They envisage a partnership between Marxism and the ‘new feminism, the protest movements of ethnic, national and sexual minorities, the anti-institutional ecology struggles waged by marginalized layers of the population, the anti-nuclear movement, the atypical forms of social struggle in countries on the capitalist periphery’"
9819,所谓法兰克福学派，指的是一个以法兰克福大学社会研究所为大本营的德国知识分子群体。,The Frankfurt School is the name given to a group of German intellectuals associated with the Institute for Social Research at the University of Frankfurt.
9819,该研究所成立于1923年，并于希特勒上台后的1933年迁至美国纽约，隶属于哥伦比亚大学。,"The Institute was established in 1923.Following the coming to power of Hitler in 1933, it moved to New York, attaching itself to the University of Columbia."
9819,1949年，研究所再度迁回德国。,In 1949 it moved back to Germany.
9819,法兰克福学派的主要研究风格混合了马克思主义和精神分析学说，常常被人们称为“批判理论”。,‘Critical Theory’ is the name given to the Institute’s critical mix of Marxism and psychoanalysis.
9820,用这一理论也可解释广泛存在的夫兄弟婚和妻姐妹婚制度。,The widespread institutions of levirate and sororate are explainable by this theory also.
9820,在夫兄弟婚中，一个人与其已故兄弟的妻子或妻子们结婚。,In the levirate a man marries the wife or wives of his deceased brother.
9820,当一个人按照习俗与其亡妻的未婚姐妹联姻时，这种做法被称之为妻姐妹婚。,When a man customarily marries the unwed sister of his deceased wife the practice is called sororate.
9821,“契约”涉及到一种协议，即一个文本将以我们所确认的各种方式对我们说话。,"A ""contract"" involves an agreement that a text will talk to us in ways we recognise."
9821,它将进入到与我们的一种对话之中。,It will enter into  a dialogue with us.
9821,而那种对话，加上它的可靠因素和形式，将同我们社会生活的某些方面联系起来……我一直在说明特殊的喜剧为其读者的社会生活的某个方面提供了一种契约……,"And that dialogue, with its dependable elements and form, will relate to some aspect of our lives in our society.… I have been illustrating the way specific comics offer a contract to some aspect of the social lives of their readers…"
9822,它是他们生存本身的前提条件。,It is a prerequisite of their very existence.
9822,但是价值的这层含义也扩散开去，并恒久地与手工能力和理论知识相联系。,"This sense of value, however, also pervades and becomes permanently attached to both manual ability and theoretical knowledge."
9822,体现在所有原始技术、原始经济组织和社会组织中的科学态度，即考虑未来活动时依靠过去的经验，是一个整体的要素。我们必须假定它从人类产生之初，从这个物种刚刚开始其作为器物制作人（homo faber)、智人（homo sapiens)、政治人（homo politcus)的生涯时，就在起作用。,"The scientific attitude, embodied in all primitive technology and also in the organization of primitive economic enterprises and social organization, that reliance on past experience with the view to future performance, is an integral factor which must be assumed as having been at work from the very beginning of mankind, ever since the species started on its career as homo faber, as homo sapiens, and as homo policus."
9822,原始共同体中，只要有一代人丧失对这种科学态度及对其价值的珍视，该群体就会沦落到动物的境地，或者更可能就此灭绝。,"Were the scientific attitude and the valuation of it to become extinct even for one generation in a primitive community, such a community would either lapse into an animal status or, more likely, become extinct."
9823,过度性与浅白性是“生产者式文本”的主要特征。,Excessiveness and obviousness are central features of the producerly text.
9823,这两种特征提供了创造大众文化的丰富和肥沃的资源。,They provide fertile raw resources out of which popular culture can be made.
9823,过度性指的是意义挣脱控制，挣脱意识形态规范的控制或是任何特定文本的要 求。,"Excessiveness is meaning out of control, meaning that exceeds the norms of ideological control or the requirements of any specific text."
9824,流行音乐展现的是“情感现实主义”（emotional realism);青年男女“认同这些集体表征，并以之指引自己的想象。对青少年来说，这些象征性的想象就如同甜美的民谣一样，部分地塑造并建构着他们心中的世界图景”（281)。,"Pop music exhibits ‘emotional realism’; young men and women ‘identify with these collective representations and . . . use them as guiding fictions. Such symbolic fictions are the folklore by means of which the teenager, in part, shapes and composes his mental picture of the world’ (281)."
9824,此外，霍尔和维诺还考察了青少年言谈的方式、常去的场所以及特殊的着装方式——正是这些让他们与成年人的世界保持着距离。,"Hall and Whannel also identify the way in which teenagers use parThe Interpretation of Culturesular ways of talking, parThe Interpretation of Culturesular places to go, particular ways of dancing, and particular ways of dressing, to establish distance from the world of adults."
9825,这个恰恰相当于文化的环境必须持续地得到再生、维持和管理。,"This environment, which is neither more nor less than culture itself, has to be permanently reproduced, maintained, and managed."
9825,这就创造出该字眼最一般意义上所谓的生活的新水准。它取决于社区文化水准，取决于环境，也取决于群体的劳动效率。,"This creates what might be described in the most general sense of the term as a new standard of living, which depends on the cultural level of the community, on the environment, and on the efficiency of the group."
9825,然而，生活的文化水准意味着新需求的出现，以及有新的驱力（imperatives)或决定因素被加之于人类行为。,"A cultural standard of living, however, means that new needs appear and new imperatives or determinants are imposed on human behavior."
9825,很明显，文化传统必须从一代传递给下一代。,"Clearly, cultural tradition has to be transmitted from each generation to the next."
9825,某种教育方法和机制必然存在于每种文化之中。,Methods and mechanisms of an educational character must exist in every culture.
9826,不过，权力并非单纯通过凝视来控制我们，而是想方设法让我们自己意识到凝视的存在，进而也就迫使我们进行自我约束。,"But it is not simply that power catches us in its gaze, rather power works when we recognize its gaze."
9826,福柯曾以剧院作比来阐述这一论点：“我们既非身处古罗马圆形剧场，亦非置身于舞台之上，但我们仍感觉自己正在被人监视……这就是全景敞视机制所产生的权力效应。从我们进人此体系那一刻起，就已被它牢牢控制住了。,"As Foucault makes clear, using a theatre metaphor, ""We are neither in the amphitheatre, nor on the stage, but in the panoptic machine, invested by its effects of power, which we bring to ourselves since we are part of the mechanism"" ."
9826,”由是，福柯指出，监视成了权力机制发挥作用的首要方式。,"In this way, then, he argues, surveillance has become the dominant mode of the operation of power."
9827,普鲁士的权威主义不仅在家庭生活中，而且在市民日常生活中根深蒂固，这就需要对德国制定某种谈和条件。,"Prussian authoritarianism, embedded as it is in the family and in the daily civic life, makes necessary certain kinds of peace terms for Germany."
9827,明智的谈和条款对日本应该不同于对德国。,Wise peace directives would differ from those for Japan.
9827,德国人不象日本人，他们不认为自己对社会和历史欠恩情，他们努力奋斗，不是为了偿还无穷的债务或恩情，而是避免沦为牺牲者。,"Germans do not regard themselves, like the Japanese, as debtors to the world and to the ages.They strive, not to repay an incalculable debt, but to avoid being victims."
9828,从很多方面看，这都不是件易事。,"This is, in many ways, a daunting task."
9828,正如托尼•本内特（Tony Bennett)所指出的那样：“从当下情况看，‘大众文化’这一概念实在无用， 它似乎把若干混沌不清乃至彼此抵触的含义塞进一个大熔炉，只会将种种对真相的探索引入理论的死胡同。,"As Tony Bennett (1980) points out, ‘as it stands, the concept of popular culture is virtually useless, a melting pot of confused and contradictory meanings capable of misdirecting inquiry up any number of theoretical blind alleys’ (18)."
9828,”（Bennett，1980: 18)此种“界定困难”一部分源自“他者”（otherness)这一概念的特殊性--当我们使用 “大众文化”这一表述时，暗示着与大众文化相对的“他者”总是缺席/在场的。,Part of the difficulty stems from the implied otherness that is always absent/ present when we use the term ‘popular culture’.
9828,在阅读后面的章节时，你也会发现我们往往有意无意地将大众文化与其他文化——民间文化、群氓文化、宰制性文化、工人阶级文化等等——进行对比，并在对比中为“大众文化”下定义。,"As we shall see in the chapters which follow, popular culture is always defined, implicitly or explicitly, in contrast to other conceptual categories: folk culture, mass culture, dominant culture, working-class culture, etc."
9829,文化是一个活生牛的、积极的过程：它只能从内郜发展出来，而不能无中生有，或从上面强加而成。,"Culture is a living, active process: it can be developed only from within, it cannot be imposed from without or above."
9829,群众文化（mass culture)理论家的担忧，并未在实践中得到证实，因为群众文化一词如此自相矛盾，以致无法存在。,The fears of the mass culture theorists have not been borne out in practice because mass culture is such a contradiction in terms that it cannot exist.
9829,一种同质性的、外部生成的文化并不能现成地卖给群众：文化完全不是那样运作的。,"A homogeneous, externally produced culture cannot be sold ready-made to the masses: culture simply does not work like that."
9830,“心理学解释并未曾使任何人在历史现象的分类方面获得很大进展，我也不能转而依赖于它。,"“Psychological explanations have not got anyone very far in reducing the phenomena of history to order, and I shall not fall back on them."
9830,”但在当前的人格研究和墨迹实验中，克鲁伯几乎成了孤家寡人。,""" But in these days of personality studies and ink-blot tests, Kroeber stands almost alone."
9830,如何解释人类学从文化学倒退到心理学和精神病学的现象呢？,How is anthropology's regression from culturology to psychology and psychiatry to be explained?
9831,因此，我们所讲的人性，就是指内在于每个文明及其中所有个体的生物决定因素，即执行诸如呼吸、睡觉、休息、营养、排泄和生殖等躯体功能。,"By human nature, therefore, we mean the biological determinism which imposes on every civilization and on all individuals in it the carrying out of such bodily functions as breathing, sleep, rest, nutrition, excretion, and reproduction."
9831,我们可以将基本需求定义为群体和个体为了生存而必须满足的环境和生物条件。,We can define the concept of basic needs as the environmental and biological conditions which must be fulfilled for the survival of the individual and the group.
9831,事实上，两者的生存都要求维持以保持为文化表演所必须的起码健康和活力，并保持为防止逐渐的人口减少所必需的最低数量。,"lndeed, the survival of both requires the maintenance of a minimum of health and vital energy necessary for the performance of cultural tasks, and for the minimum numbers necessary for the prevention of gradual depopulation."
9832,里特尔（Ritter)和拉策尔两人可能是这一思潮的先锋人物。无论举他们中哪一位的工作为例，我们都可以看到他们对旧进化论的修正在于：他们在全球场景之内考察历史过程。,"Whether we take the work of Ritter or Ratzel, who probably might be regarded as pioneers of this movement, we find that the correction of the older evolutionism consists in regarding historical processes wTithin the context of the globe."
9832,人类地理学 (anthropo-geographic)观点暗示，对每一文化的思考都必须考虑其所处的自然环境。,"The anthropo-geographic point of view implies, on the one hand, the consideration of each culture within its natural surroundings."
9832,作为一种方法，它也要求在讨论文化问题时应借助地图，并且要按文化的各组成部分来参考文化分布图。,"As a method it also demands the posing of cultural problems with reference to a map, and to a map of the distribution of cultures in terms of their component parts."
9832,正如科学总是通过采用另一套决定因素体系（system of determinants）而获益一样，这一思潮给人类学以极大助益。,"In so far as science always gains by moving into another system of determinants, this movement has rendered great services to anthropology."
9833,这个简要的概括实际上是我们以下更全面分析的蓝图。它表明科学的人类学是基于制度的理论，即对组织单位类型的具体分析。,"This brief outline, which is really a blueprint for our following fuller analysis, indicates that scientific anthropology consists in a theory of institutions, that is, a concrete analysis of the type units of an organization."
9833,作为一种关于基本需求，关于功用和整合驱力之衍生的理论，科学的人类学提供给我们功能的分析，使我们能界定习俗性观念和发明能力的形式和意义。,"As a theory of basic needs, and a derivation of instrumental and integrative imperatives, scientific anthropology gives us the functional analysis, which allows us to define the form, as well as the meaning, of a customary idea or contrivance."
9834,经济学和法学、政治科学和美学、语言学、考古学和比较宗教研究，则是后来加人到人文学科中的新内容。,"Economics and jurisprudence, political science and aesthetics, linguistics, archaeology, and the comparative study of religions, constitute a more recent addition to humanism."
9834,约两个世纪前，研究人类心智的心理学，随后又有探究人类关系的社会学，被列人正式的学术研究名录。,"Some two centuries ago psychology, the study of the mind, and later on, sociology, an inquiry into human relations, were added to the list of official academic studies."
9834,人类学，作为广义的人的科学，作为人文研究中最宽泛的学科，是一位姗姗来迟者。,"Anthropology, as the science of man at large, as the most comprehensive discipline in humanism without portfolio, was the last to come."
9835,"人类学，作为广义的人的科学，作为人文研究中最宽泛的 “无论所""学科，是一位姗姗来迟者。","Anthropology, as the science of man at large, as the most comprehensive discipline in humanism without portfolio, was the last to come."
9835,因此，它必须得在范围、 对象、方法等方面见缝插针，挤出空间。,"It had to peg out its claims as to scope, subject matter, and method as best it could."
9835,它搜罗别人的剩余，甚至要悄然挤占老学科的一些领地。,"It absorbed what was left over, and even had to encroach on some older preserves."
9836,只有群体持续而正常地更新，文化才能继续存在。,No culture can continue if the group is not replenished continually and normally.
9836,相反，文化会明显地随着群体的不断萎缩而逐渐消亡。,"Otherwise, obviously, the culture will perish through the progressive dying out of the group."
9836,因此每个人类群体以及群体内的每个个体都受某些起码最低条件的制约。,"Certain minimum conditions are thus imposed on all groups of human beings, and on all individual organisms within the group."
9836,我们可以根据一个事实来定义人性（human nature)：即无论居于何处及实践何种文明，人们都必须吃喝、呼吸、睡觉、生育，并且从机体排泄废物。,"We can define the term ""human nature"" by the fact that all men have to eat, they have to breathe, to sleep, to procreate, and to eliminate waste matter from their organisms wherever they live and whatever type of civilization they practise."
9837,后现代的另一个重要方面是文化的融合，即“新媒体与旧媒体互相碰撞，草根媒体与商业媒体互相交叠，媒体生产者与媒体消费者亦以前所未有的方式互相影响”。,"Another aspect of the postmodern is convergence culture,‘where old and new media collide, where grassroots and corporate media intersect, where the power of the media producer and the power of the media consumer interact in unpredictable ways’."
9837,所谓“融合”，指的是媒介内容在一系列不同平台间的流动。,Convergence involves the flow of media content across a range of different platforms.
9837,这并非简单的新技术问题，而是一个要求消费者更加主动地参与到传媒生产之中的过程。,This is not simply a matter of new technologies but a process that requires the active participation of consumers.
9838,如此看来，这一封面所展示的，并不是逃避现实者的幻想， 即为单调的日常生活带来不同寻常的剌激。,"This page, then, is not an escapist fantasy bringing some unusual stimulation into the drabness of the everyday."
9838,对煽情主义 (Sensationalism)进行轻蔑的“解释'会使人最终相信，那些能在当中找到乐趣的人根本上都是没有辨识能力的人；他们的感 觉是那么迟钝，只有最粗陋、最夸张的煽情主义才能在他们身上 奏效。虽然这样的观点或许有利于巩固那些赞同此观点的人的自我，但是却很难解释当下这类杂志在美国大受欢迎的原因。,"Such a dismissive ""explanation"" of sensationalism leads one finally to the belief that those who find pleasure in it are essentially undiscriminating and have such blunted sensibilities that only the crassest, most exaggerated sensationalism can get through to them at all—a view that may do much for the egos of those that hold it, but that does little to explain the popularity of such magazines in contemporary America."
9839,就阿多诺本人对现代通俗文化的理解来说，很少有什么论述能够较生动地概括马克思的商品拜物教理论的含义。处于阿多诺文化工业理论背后的，是马克思的理论。,Few statements could more graphically summarise the relevance of Marx's theory of commodity fetishism for Adorno's attempt to use the idea of the culture industry to understand modern popular culture.
9839,在阿多诺和法兰克福学派看来，马克思对商品拜物教的讨论是一种理论的基础，即像通俗音乐这样的文化形式可以起到保证资本在经济上、政治上和意识形态上持久统治的作用。,"For Adorno and the Frankfurt School, commodity fetishism is the basis of a theory of how cultural forms such as popular music can secure the continuing economic, political and ideological domination of capitalism."
9840,战争是社会有机体之间的斗争，而不是个人之间的斗争。,"Warfare is a struggle between social organisms, not individuals."
9840,因此，对战争只能从社会或文化上进行解释，而不能从心理学上加以说明。,
9840,,"Its explanation is therefore social or cultural, not psychological."
9840,靠着调查男人和女人的心理动机，我们将永远也不能理解美国为什么要参加第二次世界大战或其他任何一场战争。,We could never understand why the United States entered World War II—or any other war—by an inquiry into the psychological motives of men and women.
9841,例如，英国保守党在1990年制作播出了一期政治宣传节目，节目结束时的最后一个词是“社会主义”，而此时电视上出现了红色监狱栅栏的影像，这就暗示其竞争对手工党所鼓吹的社会主义无异于建造了社会、经济与政治的囹崮。,"For example, a Conservative Party political broadcast transmitted in 1990 ended with the word ""socialism"" being transposed into red prison bars.What was being suggested is that the socialism of the Labour Party is synonymous with social, economic and political imprisonment."
9841,这期节目就是要达到为“社会主义”一词赋予内涵的目的。,"The broadcast was attempting to fix the connotations of the word ""socialism""."
9841,此外，此举还旨在将对手置于某种二元对立关系——社会主义意味着囚禁，而保守主义倡导自由——之中。,"Moreover, it hoped to locate socialism in a binary relationship in which it connoted unfreedom, whilst conservatism connoted freedom."
9842,在每种场合下他的活动都由一系列关系决定，包括与某些商业或工业企业，与学校或宗教机构，与政治社团或娱乐组织机构的关系等。他在这些机构中或是官员或是普通职员。,"In every case his activities are determined by his relation to some commercial or industrial business, to a school or a religious institution, to a political association or a recreational organization of which he is the official or the servant."
9842,如果我们调査个人的日常行为，或男或女、或老或少、或健康或体弱，都能发现其生存的所有阶段必须都与这种或那种由我们的文化进一步细分的组织化活动系统相联系。,"If we were to survey the daily behavior of any individual, male or female, young or old, healthy or sick, we would find that all phases of his existence must be related to one or other of the systems of organized activities into which our culture can be subdivided; which, in their agglomerate, really constitute our culture."
9843,这时，他们的父亲就会教训说：“你希望的是什么？要体会人生，就必须接受一些训练；如果放弃修养，今后肯定会不愉快。如果陷入这种处境而遭受社会上议论，我是不会袒护你的。,"Their fathers may talk to them and say, 'What do you wish? Some training is necessary to savor life. If you give this up and do not train yourself at all, you will be unhappy as a natural consequence. And if these natural consequences should occur, I should not be inclined to protect you against public opinion.'"
9843,”用他们常用的说法，修养就是磨掉“身上的锈’。,"Shuyo, in the phrase they use so often, polishes away 'the rust of the body.'"
9843,它会使人变成一把锋利的刀。这当然是他们所希望的。,"It makes a man a bright sharp sword, which is, of course, what he desires to be."
9844,在整个这段时期，可以追溯出某种前后一致的文化模式。,Throughout this period a consistent cultural pattern can be traced.
9844,大众的快感被视为在社会秩序之外并因而威胁到它。,Popular pleasures were recognized to lie outside social control and thus to threaten it.
9844,这些快感粗鲁不雅、无视规矩的特征，被中产阶级描绘成不道德的、无序的以及在经济上不节俭的。,"Their unruliness was characterized by the middle classes as immoral, disorderly, and economically improvident."
9844,这些社会层面的威胁，被局部化到个人内部，无产阶级的身体成为个人的身体。,These social threats were localized within the individual; the proletarian body became the individual body.
9844,于是身体的快感与无度——酗酒、做爱、懒散、粗暴——被视为对社会秩序的威胁。,"So the pleasures and excesses of the body—drunkenness, sexuality, idleness, rowdiness—were seen as threats to the social order."
9844,个人身体的快感构成了对身体政治（body poliThe Interpretation of Cultures)的威胁。,The pleasures of the individual body constituted a threat to the body politics.
9845,列维—施特劳斯指出，神话的运行方式和语言是一样的。神话是由“神话素”构成的，就像语言是由“词素”和“音素”等单元构成的一样。,"Myths, Lévi-Strauss argues, work like language: they comprise individual ""mythemes"", analogous to individual units of language, ""morphemes"" and ""phonemes""."
9845,如词素和音素一般，神话素无法独立生成意义，而必须以某种方式被组合起来方可。,"Like morphemes and phonemes, mythemes only take on meaning when combined in particular patterns."
9846,P•P•克鲁泡特金（Prince Peter Kropotkin)正确地指出，在合作共同体中，个体之间的互助是个支配性概念，而个体间的生存竞争则不适用于整体的人类社会。,"Prince Peter Kropotkin was quite right in pointing out that mutual aid between individuals of a cooperative community is the dominant concept, while the struggle between the individuals for survival can not be applied to human societies as a whole."
9846,我们不能仅依据极少的文献证据就想当然地将物竞天择的概念应用于原始共同体，当然更不能把战争、弱者群体灭绝和强者以弱者、胜者以败者为代价的扩张假定为一种常态。,"We could not intelligently and with any chance of documentary evidence apply the concept of struggle for existence to primitive communities, certainly not in the sense of assuming a perpetual state of warfare, of extermination of weaker groups and the expansion of 'stronger ones at the expense of those defeated or destroyed."
9846,不过，我们可以将生存价值的概念应用于文化。,"We can, however, apply the concept of survival value to cultures."
9846,在此它或许不应与文化内或文化间斗争（struggle)的任何概念，而应与竞争（competition)的概念相搭配。,"This probably would not be coupled here with any concept of struggle, but rather with that of competition, within cultures and between cultures."
9846,我们能肯定，任 何文化在功用效能、人工制品、合作或符号精确性等方面的失败，都会不可避免地导致整个文化器物层的逐渐消失。,"We could affirm that the failure within any culture as regards instrumental efficiency, artifacts, cooperation, or symbolic accuracy, would inevitably lead to the gradual extinction of the whole cultural apparatus."
9847,为了构拟这份清单，我们最好先考虑将人们聚集整合为永久性群体的普同性原理。,In order to construct such a list it might be best to consider the general principles which bind human beings together and integrate them into permanent groups.
9847,我们首先看到的事实当然就是生育。,"We have, of course, first and foremost, the fact of reproduction."
9847,在所有人类社会中，生育，即夫妻关系和亲子关系，导致规模虽小却极其重要的群体的产生。,"In all human societies, reproduction, that is, the relationship between husband and wife, and parents and children, leads to the formation of small yet exceedingly important groups."
9847,因此，我们可以讨论生育的整合原理即亲属关系原理，亦即血亲关系和姻亲关系。,"We can, therefore, speak about the reproductive principle of integration or the principle of kinship, that is, relationship by blood and relationship by marriage."
9848,《摇滚与摔跤》节目拒绝“公正”。,"Rock 'n' Wrestling refuses ""fairness."""
9848,它就是不公正。,It is unfair.
9848,没有人被给予“胜负均等的机会”（sporting chance)，而且任何人如果想要“公平比赛”，就会被占便宜，且最终会受到惩处。,"Nobody is given a ""sporting chance"" and anyone who attempts to ""play fair"" is taken advantage of and suffers as a result."
9848,不过评论员倒是一次又一次把我们带回到这个被拒绝的标准，作为理解这场动作的出发点。,Yet the commentators return us again and again to this rejected standard as a point from which to make sense of the action.
9849,文化也是一种实践（praxis)，或是在某一社会中分配日用品、导引生产流向的一种方式；就生产方式最宽泛的意义而言，文化是……有关生产的观念（notion)，而生产则因人的存在而获得充足的涵义。,"A culture is also a praxis or a means of distributing supplies in a society and thus directing the flow of production; it is, in the widest sense a means of production, . . . the notion of production then acquires its full significance as production by a human being of his own existence."
9849,……这首先暗示了文化不是 无用的，也不仅仅是一种过剩的玩意儿，而是内在于某一存 在模式中的特定行为。其次，它暗示了阶级利益（在结构的意义上，联系着生产和财产关系）并不能确保整个社会的生产劳动仅靠自己的力量便可以存在。,". . .This implies first that culture is not useless, a mere exuberance, but a specific activity inherent in a mode of existence, and second that class interests (structurally connected to production and property relations) cannot ensure the totality of society's operative existence unaided."
9850,文化工业经营各种谎言，而不是真理，经营各种虚假需求和虚假解决办法，而不是现实的需求和现实的解决办法。,"The culture industry deals in falsehoods not truths, in false needs and false solutions, rather than real needs and real solutions."
9850,它“仅仅在表面上”解决各种问题，不是按照在现实世界中应当解决它们的那样去做。,"It solves problems ‘only in appearance’, not as they should be resolved in the real world."
9850,"它提供解决各种问题的伪装,而不是实质，把对各种虚假需求的虚假满足当作对各种现实问题的现实解决办法的替代物。","It offers the semblance not the substance of resolving problems, the false satisfaction of false needs as a substitute for the real solution of real problems."
9850,它在这么做时将大众的意识接管了。,"In doing this, it takes over the consciousness of the masses."
9851,"奥萨治人由亲属团体组成,在这种氏族中，世系血统通过父系相传，对母系则置之不理。",The Osage are organized in kinship groups in which descent is traced through the father and disregards the mother's line.
9851,这些氏族团体继承一个共同的超自然的福赐。,These clan groups have a common inheritance of supernatural blessing.
9851,"每个氏族的传说都讲着其祖先如何寻求一种幻象，并且怎样得到某一动物的祝福,该氏族的姓氏正是这种动物的名称。","The legend of each clan tells how its ancestor sought a vision, and was blessed by the animal whose name the clan has inherited."
9852,当然，这种创造力的另一面是“事后的再书写”（retrospective rewriting)，即假设剧本书与本来应该发生什么，能像前文本那么富有创造性。,"The flip-side of this creativity of course is retrospective ""rewriting""—the what-would-have-happened if script can be just as productive as the predictive one."
9852,以这种方式，书迷闲聊填补了文本的裂隙。,"In this way, fan gossip fills in the gaps in the text."
9852,它说明了文本中省略或掩埋了的动机和结果，它扩展了解释的空间，提供了另一种或者额外的洞见；它再诠释，再表现，再创造。,"It explains motivations and consequences omitted from or buried in the text itself; it expands explanations, offers alternative or extended insights; it reinterprets, re-presents, reproduces."
9852,原初的文本是一种文化资源，从中可以生产出无数的新文本。,The original text is a cultural resource out of which numerous new texts are made.
9852,前者的结构可能会限制或决定新文本的范围，但是永远不可能限制使用它的“书迷”的创造力和“生产者的特性”。,"Its structure may limit or determine the range of new texts that can be produced from it, but it can never limit the creativity, the ""producerliness"" of the fans that use it."
9853,“这一至关重要且格外敏感的互文性折射出受众的能力与叙事技巧的变迁，而构成娱乐与文化素养的种种因素亦在后现代文化的图景中变得面目全非。,"He argues that “This foregrounded, hyperconscious intertextuality reflects changes in terms of audience competence and narrative technique, as well as a fundamental shift in what constitutes both entertainment and cultural literacy in post- modern culture”."
9853,”其结果就是“叙事行为如今在两个层面上同时运作：一是人物的历险，二是文本的历险。两者共同构成了当代文化产品的循环系统”。,"As a consequence of this, Collins argues, ‘Narrative action now operates at two levels simultaneously--in reference to character adventure and in reference to a text’s adventures in the array of contemporary cultural production.’"
9854,但是，说巴厘人的宗教在方法上没有条理，并不是说它完全没有秩序。,"Yet, again, to say that Balinese religion is not methodically ordered is not to say that it is not ordered at all."
9854,"它不仅有着连续一致的、极有特点的格调(一种只有大量的描述才能引发的刻意的戏剧性）,而且组成它的因素形成一系列明确的仪式复合体(complex),它反过来又对含蓄但不乏合理性的适当的宗教问题显示出明确的态度。","Not only is it pervaded with a consistent, highly distinctive tone (a kind of sedulous theatricalism which only extended description could evoke), but the elements which comprise it cluster into a number of relatively well-defined ritual complexes which exhibit, in turn, a definite approach to properly religious issues no less reasonable for being implicit."
9854,其中有三方面最重要：（1)寺庙体系；（2）社会不平等的神圣化;（3）死亡和巫术崇拜。,"Of these, three are of perhaps greatest importance: (I) the temple system; (2) the sanctification of social inequality; and (3) the cult of death and witches."
9855,从很多方面看，这都不是件易事。,"This is, in many ways, a daunting task."
9855,正如托尼•本内特（Tony Bennett)所指出的那样：“从当下情况看，‘大众文化’这一概念实在无用， 它似乎把若干混沌不清乃至彼此抵触的含义塞进一个大熔炉，只会将种种对真相的探索引入理论的死胡同。,"As Tony Bennett (1980) points out, ‘as it stands, the concept of popular culture is virtually useless, a melting pot of confused and contradictory meanings capable of misdirecting inquiry up any number of theoretical blind alleys’ (18)."
9855,”（Bennett，1980: 18)此种“界定困难”一部分源自“他者”（otherness)这一概念的特殊性--当我们使用 “大众文化”这一表述时，暗示着与大众文化相对的“他者”总是缺席/在场的。,Part of the difficulty stems from the implied otherness that is always absent/ present when we use the term ‘popular culture’.
9855,在阅读后面的章节时，你也会发现我们往往有意无意地将大众文化与其他文化——民间文化、群氓文化、宰制性文化、工人阶级文化等等——进行对比，并在对比中为“大众文化”下定义。,"As we shall see in the chapters which follow, popular culture is always defined, implicitly or explicitly, in contrast to other conceptual categories: folk culture, mass culture, dominant culture, working-class culture, etc."
9856,但是，很多古典学派在一个要点上是犯了有意为之而不是疏忽遗漏之过。,"There is, however, one point on which the various older schools have committed a sin of commission, rather than omission."
9856,人类文化“死物”或文化化石这一概念缺乏批判力，有时甚至是反科学的。,"This is the uncritical and, at times, even anti-scientific concept of ""dead-weights"" or cultural fossils in human culture."
9856,我这里指的是那种认为文化范围广泛，即使脱离了其所处背景的观念、信仰、组织、风俗、器物也具有十分重要地位的信条。,"By this I mean the principle that cultures harbor to a considerable extent, and in positions of strategic importance, ideas, beliefs, institutions, customs, and objects which do not really belong in their context."
9856,在进化理论中，这种死物在“遗存”的伪装下出现。,"In evolutionary theories, such dead-weights appear under the guise of ""survivals""."
9856,播化论把它们叫做“借来特质”或特质丛。,"The diffusionist speaks of them as ""borrowed traits"" or ""trait complexes."""
9857,最近，特质分析法（trait analysis）在加利福尼亚大学得到了一种新的和当之无愧的复兴。,Quite recently a new and very competent revival of trait analysis has been undertaken at the University of California.
9857,这一研究的牵头人是A•L•克罗伯教授。他正确地认识到，特质分析以及用特质或特质丛进行文化特征概括，都取决于他们能否作为现实而加以离析，并因而能在实际观察和理论上变得可以比较。,"Professor A. L. Kroeber, the leader of this inquiry, quite rightly recognizes that trait analysis and the characterization of culture by traits or trait complexes depends on the question whether they can be isolated as realities, and thus made comparable in observation and theory."
9858,实际上，日本人关于天皇的概念是太平洋诸岛上一再被发现的那种概念。,The truth is that Japan's conception of her Emperor is one that is found over and over among the islands of the Pacific.
9858,他是神圣首领，可以参与政治，也可以不参与。,He is the Sacred Chief who may or may not take part in administration.
9858,在一些太平洋岛屿上，他自己行使权力；在另一些岛屿上，则将权力委托给别人。,In some Pacific islands he did and in some he delegated his authority.
9858,但他的人身则是神圣的。,But always his person was sacred.
9859,弗雷泽认为，巫术来源于原始人的一种基本观念。,Magic to Frazer is due to an essential conception of primitive man.
9859,它是观念联动原理（the principles of association of ideas)的应用--或误用--以及这些原理向一种自然过程理论的转移（transposition)。,"It is the application, or rather misapplication, of the principles of association of ideas, and their transposition into a theory of natural processes."
9859,巫术的两大原理是：同类相生（like produces like)和相互接解过的事物在远距离内继续相互作用。,"The two principles of magic are that like produces like, and that things which have been once in contact with each other continue to act on each other at a distance."
9859,弗雷泽称这两条原理为原始巫术自然观法则（the laws of primitive magical outlook)。,Frazer designates these two principles as the laws of primitive magical outlook.
9859,“虽然这些法则未经言语阐明，甚至蛮人也不这样抽象地考虑它们。但蛮人潜在地相信它们很能独立人类意志而调节自然过程。”,"""Though these laws are certainly not formulated in so many words, nor even conceived in the abstract by the savage, they are nevertheless implicitly believed by him to regulate the course of nature quite independently of human will."""
9860,上学之前以及上学后的头二、三年内，男孩与女孩一起结伴玩。但多数是同性之间最亲近，特别是同年龄的孩子最易结为密友。,"Girls and boys play together until they go to school, and for two or three years after, but closest ties are likely to be between children of the same sex and especially between children of the same chronological age."
9860,这样的同年集团，特别是在农村可以持续终生，其持续性超过其它集团。,"These age-groups (donen), especially in the villages, are lifelong and survive all others."
9860,在须惠村，上了年纪的人，“随着性关系的逐渐减退，同年人的集会便成为人生的真正乐趣。须惠村俗话说：‘同年比老婆还要近’。”,"In the village of Suye Mura, “as sexual interests decrease parties of donen are the true pleasures left in life. Suye (the village) says, ‘Donen are closer than a wife.’”"
9861,1944年，西奥多•阿多诺和马克斯•霍克海默用“文化工业”这个概念来描述流氓文化的产品及其生产过程。,In 1944 Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer coined the term ‘culture industry’ to designate the products and processes of mass culture.
9861,他们声称，文化工业生产出来的产品具有两个特征：第一，同质性电影、广播和杂志构成了一个体系，生产出来的东西从整体到局部都是千篇一律的……所有的流氓文化都差不多”。第二，可预见性。,"The products of the culture industry, they claim, are marked by two features: homogeneity, ‘film, radio and magazines make up a system which is uniform as a whole and in every part...all mass culture is identical’; and predictability:"
9862,很明显，后现代主义已经成了近年来引起日益增长的兴趣和注意的一个问题。,Postmodernism has attracted increasing interest and attention in recent years.
9862,单是根据已出版的书名所使用的术语或它们的对应词语来判断，或者根据它们阐明自己对后现代主义的关注来判断，就很容易看出这一点。,"This can readily be seen by the book titles published using the term or its equivalents, or making clear their concern with postmodernism."
9862,《已出版图书》的索引显示，1978年到1981年期间，没有出版书名与后现代主义有关的任何图书，但在1988年出版了14种，1989年出版了22种，1990年出版了29种。,"The Books in Print index shows no book titles published on postmodernism between 1978 and 1981, but 14 published in 1988, 22 in 1989 and 29 in 1990."
9863,考虑一下图腾制度。,Consider totemism.
9863,图腾制度长期被认为是一个自发的、一元化的社会习俗，一种原始的自然崇拜，被以这一种或是那一种机械论——进化论、功能主义、精神分析法、功利主义——来加以解释。对莱维‑斯特劳斯来说，这仅仅是从特殊的形象中建立起概念结构的倾向的一个特例。,"Long regarded as an autonomous, unitary institution, a kind of primitive nature worship to be explained in terms of mechanical theories of one sort or another-evolutionist, functionalist, psychoanalytic, utilitarian-it is for Levi-Strauss only a special case of this overall tendency to build conceptual schemes out of particular images/"
9864,有一些有关的问题与对通俗文化的符号学分析有联系。,
9864,大多与巴特对外延和内涵的区分有关。,Barthes's distinction between denotation and connotation.
9864,有人论证说，神话之所以起作用，是因为我们看见了一个特定符号或神话的外延，但它的内涵仍然隐藏着，直到符号学家把它们向我们揭示出来。,It is argued that myth works because we see the denotations of a particular sign or myth but its connotations remain hidden until they are revealed to us by a semiologist.
9864,然而，有纯粹的外延这种东西吗？,Yet is there such a thing as pure denotation?
9864,一个符号的各种内涵即使有时不那么清晰，也没有它的外延清晰吗？,"Are not the connotations of a sign as clear as, if not sometimes more clear than, its denotations?"
9865,强大的外样大名成了倒幕派的先锋，他们想通过“王政复古”取代德川氏而统治日本，只要求换一下当权者。,"The great Outside Lords, the daimyo of Japan's strongest fiefs who spearheaded the overthrow of the Shogunate, thought of the Restoration as a way in which they, instead of the Tokugawa, could rule Japan.They wanted a mere change of personnel."
9865,农民们盼望多保留一些自己收获的稻米，却讨厌“改革”。,The farmers wanted to keep more of the rice they raised but they hated 'reforms.'
9865,武土阶层则希望保持俸禄，并能挥刀上阵建立功勋。,The samurai wanted to keep their pensions and be allowed to use their swords for greater glory.
9865,在财政上支持王政复古派军队的商人们，希望推行重商主义，却从未指责过封建制度。,"The merchants, who financed the Restoration forces, wanted to expand mercantilism but they never arraigned the feudal system."
9866,人类长期以来抱有万能的幻觉。,Man has long cherished the illusion of omnipotence.
9866,这种幻觉是人的自我感到满足和舒适。,
9866,,It is flattering and comforting to his ego.
9866,在过去人相信能够控制天气，无数的原始民族为祈求雨水、平息大风和预防暴风雪而举行各种仪式。,"In days gone by, man has believed that he could control the weather; countless primitive peoples have had rituals for making rain, stilling high winds, or averting storms."
9867,“王政复古”使天皇位居顶峰，废除了将军，简化了等级制。,The Restoration had simplified the hierarchal order by placing the Emperor at its apex and eliminating the Shogun.
9867,王政复古后的政治家又废除了藩，稍除了忠于藩主和忠于国家之间的矛盾。,"The post-Restoration statesmen, by abolishing the fiefs, eliminated the conflict between loyalty to one's own seigneur and to the State."
9867,这些变化并没有从根本上否定等级制的习惯，只是赋予了一个新的位置。,These changes did not unseat hierarchal habits.They gave them a new locus.
9868,从他出生之时起，他生于其中的风俗就在塑造着他的经验与行为。,From the moment of his birth the customs into which he is born shape his experience and behaviour.
9868,到他能说话时。他就成了自己文化的小小的创造物，而当他长大成人并能参与这种文化的活动时，其文化的习惯就是他的习惯，其文化的信仰就是他的信仰，其文化的不可能性亦就是他的不可能性。,"By the time he can talk, he is the little creature of his culture, and by the time he is grown and able to take part in its activities, its habits are his habits, its beliefs his beliefs, its impossibilities his impossibilities."
9869,我首先要说，我自己对此也不敢太武断。,I would like first to say that here I am not too dogmatic myself.
9869,我宁愿说，功能的 概念在这层意义上——即作为理解更紧密联系的社会结构，理解更广泛更深的服务和用品的分配，以及理解观念和信仰的一个新角度，作为循着某些社会现象的生命力和文化功效（cultural utility) 这一线路研究的一种重新定向，它可能会有用。,"I would rather suggest that a concept of function in this sense, that is, as a contribution towards a more closely knit social texture, towards the wider and more penetrating distribution of services and goods, as well as of ideas and beliefs, might be useful as a reorientation of research along the lines of the vitality and cultural utility of certain social phenomena."
9869,我还认为，在文化进化中，我们可以引进保全斗争（struggle for maintenance ) 的概念，不是保全个体机体，也不是保全人类群体，而是保全文化形态作为一条原理，这也许有助于估量传播的概率（chances)。,"I would also suggest that in cultural evolution we might introduce the concept of the struggle for maintenance, not of individual organisms nor yet of human groups, but rather of cultural forms.This also might be useful as a principle in assessing the chances of diffusion."
9870,在消费社会中，所有的商品既有实用价值，也有文化价值。,"In a consumer society, all commodities have cultural as well as functional values."
9870,倘若将这一要点模式化，我们必须扩展原有的经济概念，把文化经济容纳进去。在文化经济中，流通过程并非货币的周转，而是意义和快感的传播。,"To model this we need to extend the idea of an economy to include a cultural economy where the circulation is not one of money, but of meanings and pleasures."
9870,于是此处的观众，乃从一种商品转变成现 在的生产者，即意义和快感的生产者。,"Here the audience, from being a commodity, now becomes a producer, a producer of meanings and pleasures."
9871,第二章里提到过，利维斯主义者在英国为大众文化打开了教育的空间，而霍加特和威廉斯便占领了这一空间；他们一方面继承了利维斯主义的某些观点，另一方面也对其理论体系的某些基本假设提出了挑战一这多少有些自相矛盾。,"As we noted in Chapter 2, the Leavisites opened up in Britain an educational space for the study of popular culture.Hoggart and Williams occupy this space in ways that challenge many of the basic assumptions of Leavisism, whilst also sharing some of these assumptions."
9871,在重温“文化与文明”传统之余，霍加特和威廉斯向前迈了一大步，不仅开创了文化主义的传统，更为大众文化研究的文化研究路径奠定了基调。而《识字的用途》（The Uses of Literacy)、《文化与社会》与《漫长的革命》(The Long Revolution)三部著作则标志着文化主义和利维斯主义的决裂，被视为“左派利维斯主义”（left-Leavisism)的代表作（Hall，1996a)。,"It is this contradictory mixture – looking back to the ‘culture and civilization’ tradition, whilst at the same time moving forward to culturalism and the foundations of the cultural studies approach to popular culture – which has led The Uses of Literacy, Culture and Society and The Long Revolution to be called both texts of the ‘break’ and examples of ‘left-Leavisism’ (Hall, 1996a)."
9872,尽管上述几位作者的观点不尽相同，但他们的著作共同构成了文化主义的经典文本。,"This body of work, despite certain differences between its authors, constitutes the founding texts of culturalism."
9872,诚如霍尔所言：文化主义始终是英国文化研究领域内最具活力、最有特色的一支。,"As Hall was later to observe, ‘Within cultural studies in Britain, “culturalism” has been the most vigorous, indigenous strand’."
9872,在本章末尾，我们还将对文化主义在伯明翰大学当代文化研究中心的建制过程展开讨论。,The chapter will end with a brief discussion of the institutionalization of culturalism at the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies.
9873,由于在阿尔都塞看来意识形态是一个封闭的系统，所以意识形态并不是无所不能的。也就是说，为了让自己老老实实地待在专属的领地（那是一片无比和谐的神奇疆域）内，意识形态必须小心翼翼地回避那些自己无法解答的问题。,"Because ideology is for Althusser a closed system, it can only ever set itself such problems as it can answer; that is, to remain within its boundaries (a mythic realm without contradictions), it must stay silent on questions which threaten to take it beyond these boundaries."
9873,于是，阿尔都塞又提出了“问题域”①（problematic)这个概念。,This formulation leads Althusser to the concept of the ‘problematic’.
9873,他先用这一概念去解释“认识论上的断裂。”他宣称马克思1845年的著作中就存在断裂。,"He first uses the concept to explain the ‘epistemological break’, which he claims occurs in Marx’s work in 1845."
9873,所谓问题域，指的是“客观的内部指向系统……也就是确定了哪些问题需要被回答的系统”（67)。马克思的问题域不仅仅决定了他可以提出哪些问题并对其作出解答，还指明了其著作中缺失了什么问题或概念。,"Marx’s problema, ‘the objective internal reference system . . . the system of questions commanding the answers given’ (67), determines not only the questions and answers he is able to bring into play, but also the absence of problems and concepts in his work."
9874,"乌托邦作为一种至善至美的结构——在这结构中，人类生活将达到无暇的繁荣昌盛,是无法实现的。",Utopia cannot be achieved as a final and perfect structure within which human life will reach a faultless flowering.
9874,这种乌托邦只能被视为是纯然的白日梦。,Utopias of this sort should be recognized as pure day-dreaming.
9874,社会秩序的真正改善取决于更谨慎而又是更艰难的辨别力。,Real improvements in the socialorder depend upon more modest and more difficult discriminations.
9875,如其他大量情境一样，普韦布洛人的巫技是一种焦虑情结（anxiety complex）。,"Witchcraft among the Pueblos, like so many of their situations, is an anxiety complex."
9875,他们不明确地互相猜疑;假如某人极其令人讨厌，巫技就必定会施用在他身上。,"They vaguely suspect one another; and if a man is sufficiently disliked, witchcraft is sure to be attributed to him."
9875,一般的死亡与巫技断言毫无关系。,There is no concern with witchcraft allegations at an ordinary death.
9876,类似的例子不胜枚举。正是为人们所共享的、有意识或无意识的“感知结构”通过虚构文本化解了19世纪社会中的冲突与矛盾。,"All these (and more) are presented as examples of a shared structure of feeling, the unconscious and conscious working out in fictional texts of the contradictions of nineteenth-century society."
9876,文化分析就是要通过这些记录性的档案——“从诗歌到建筑，再到服饰风尚”——来对感知结构进行解读。,"The purpose of cultural analysis is to read the structure of feeling through the documentary record, ""from poems to buildings and dress-fashions""."
9877,我们的整个分析一直在强调一个重要的事实：所有组织都始终基于物质环境场景并与之紧密相联。,An important fact has been registered throughout our analysis: all organization is invariably based upon and intimately associated with the material environmental setting.
9877,没有任何制度悬于空中或以模糊不定的方式在空间中漂荡。,"No institution is suspended in the air or floating in a vague, indefinite manner through space."
9877,它们都拥有一个物质底层 (material substratum)，即以财富、器具形式而存在的环境装置特定部分，还有一个产生于活动的增益部分。,"One and all have a material substratum, that is, a reserved portion of the environmental outfit in wealth, in instruments, and also a portion of the profits accruing from concerted activities."
9877,依据宪纲而组织起来，通过社会化和组织化协作而行动，遵循他们特定行业的规则，使用他们手中的物质装备，群体从事其为之而组织的活动。,"Organized on the charter, acting through their social and organized cooperation, following the rules of their specific occupation, using the material apparatus at their disposal, the group engages in the activities for which they have organized."
9878,对戴尔来说，娱乐的乌托邦色彩是文本的特有属性。,"For Dyer, entertainment’s utopian sensibility is a property of the text."
9878,"斯戴西拓展了此一论断,将人们体验娱乐的社会情境也囊括至讨论的范畴。",Stacey extends his argument to include the social context in which entertainment is experienced.
9878,相关的通信内容和问卷调査显示，工人阶级女性从电影中获取的绝不仅仅是视觉愉悦和听觉快感，她们同时还体验到一种“共映”的仪式，分享着一个专属于电影观众的“想象共同体”，并享受到影院建筑的美妙与奢华。,"The letters and completed questionnaires by the women made it clear to her that the pleasures of cinema expressed by them were always more than the visual and aural pleasures of the cinema text--they included the ritual of attending a screening, the shared experience and imagined community of the audience, the comfort and comparative luxury of the cinema building."
9878,这可不单单是“沉醉于好莱坞的魔力”这样简单。,It was never a simple matter of enjoying the glamour of Hollywood.
9879,不过，济慈是在他那句名言里说明艺术家的人格的：“消极能力……能暗处于不定、神秘、怀疑之中而不烦躁企求实事与理智”。,"But the account of the artist's personality which Keats then gives is, in his famous phrase, that of ""Negative Capability...when a man is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason."
9879,或者：天才人物的伟大之处，非常像某些作用于中性智力的微妙化学物。不过，他们不具备个性、没有确定的性格——具有适当自我的人，其高明者，我称为有力的人。,"' Or again: Men of Genius are great as certain ethereal Chemicals operating on the Mass of neutral intellect-but theu have not any individuality, any determined Character-I would call the top and head of those who have a proper self, Men of power."
9880,我们必须将文化的理论建立在所有人类属于同一动物物种这个事实之上。,We have to base our theory of culture on the fact that all human beings belong to an animal species.
9880,人作为机体必须存在于不仅能保障其生存，亦能使其进行健康和正常的新陈代谢的状态之下。,"Man as an organism must exist under conditions which not only secure survival, but also allow of healthy and normal metabolism."
9880,只有群体持续而正常地更新，文化才能继续存在。,No culture can continue if the group is not replenished continually and normally.
9880,相反，文化会明显地随着群体的不断萎缩而逐渐消亡。,"Otherwise, obviously, the culture will perish through the progressive dying out of the group."
9881,这一概念还极大地妨碍了我们对所谓的“新娘身价”的逐步理解。它从来不是一种商业交换，而是一种复杂，但却有着相当清楚、一目了然的经济、法律以及宗教功能的合法机制。,"Here also this concept has retarded very much our gradual understanding that the so-called bride-price is never a commercial transaction, but a legal device with complex but perfectly clear and fully obvious economic, juridical, and religious functions."
9881,考察每一个“遗存”的例子，我们都能首先看到，所谓的文化“残留”的遗存性质主要来自于对事实所作的不充分分析。,"Take any example of ""survival.""You will find, first and foremost, that the survival nature of the alleged cultural ""hangover"" is due primarily to an incomplete analysis of the facts."
9881,我们还会看到，大多数“遗存”，尤其是被预测为重要的制度、基本要素或用法的遗存，正在逐步和无可挽回地从人类学理论中消失。,"You will also find that most survivals, especially those which have been predicated about important institutions, fundamental elements or usages, have gradually and progressively faded out of anthiopological theory."
9881,这一概念的真正危害是妨碍有效的田野工作。,The real harm done by this concept.was to retard effective field-work.
9881,它使研究者们不去寻求任何文化事实的当今功能，而仅仅满足于建成一个僵固的、自足的实体。,"Instead of searching for the present-day function of any cultural fact, the observer was merely satisfied in reaching a rigid, self-contained entity."
9882,赞许精神分析一点也不会减低行为理论(behaviorism)所宣称的要将社会与文化过程纳入基础心理学的重要性。,The approval of psychoanalysis does not in any way detract from the great importance which behaviorism promises to acquire as the basic psychology for the study of social and cultural processes.
9882,"我说的行为理论是指由耶鲁大学的 C·哈尔 (C·Hull),哥伦比亚大学的桑代克(Thorndike)，康奈尔大学的里德尔(H·S·Liddell)三位教授在“刺激--反应”(stimulus-- response)心理学方面做出的新发展。","By behaviorism I mean the newer developments of stimulus-and-response psychology as elaborated by Professor C. Hull at Yale, Thorndike at Columbia, or H. S. Liddell at Cornell."
9882,行为理论的价值首先在于其研究方法的局限和长处都与人类学实地考察工作相似这一事实。,"The value of behaviorism is due, first and foremost, to the fact that its methods are identified as regards limitations and advantages with those of anthropological field-work."
9882,在与异文化的人打交道时，使用短路的“移情”(empathy)，即猜想其他人会有什么思想和感受，总是比较危险的。,"In dealing with people of a different culture, it is always dangerous to use the short-circuiting of ""empathy,"" which usually amounts to guessing as to what the other person might have thought or felt."
9882,实地考察工作者和行为论者的基本原理都认为观念、感情、意欲无论有意识或无意识，都不会在深不可测的心灵之内形成神秘和隐藏的存在。,"The fundamental principle of the field-worker, as well as of the behaviorist, is that ideas, emotions and conations never continue to lead a cryptic, hidden existence within the unexplorable depths of the mind, conscious or unconscious."
9883,离开了为社会成员所共享的代码（无论是有意识的还是无意识的），内涵将会一无是处。,Without access to this shared code (conscious or unconscious) the operations of connotation would not be possible.
9883,当然，这种知识既是历史的，又是文化的，这就意味着在不同的文化传统下、在不同的历史时期内，人们所共享的社会知识体系也是不尽相同的。,"And of course such knowledge is always both historical and cultural.That is to say, it might differ from one culture to another, and from one historical moment to another."
9883,此外，造成差异的其他因素还包括阶级、种族、性别、代际和性取向等等。,"Cultural difference might also be marked by differences of class, race, gender, generation or sexuality."
9884,上述论点比较接近于霍尔（1986）晚期的“言传理论”（theory of arThe Interpretation of Culturesulation)。在这—理论中，霍尔说明了文本在大众文化中运作的双重方式。其一为文本中心的方式，其二为读者中 心的方式。,"This accords better with Hall's (1986) later theory of articulation, in which he accounts for the double way in which texts work in popular culture: a text-centered way, and a reader-centered way."
9885,让我就此试举一例—这是一个假定的例子，但有经验研究为基础。这是拉德薇（1984)对言情小说读者的研究。,"Let me take an example of this—a hypothetical one, but one based on an empirical study—Radway's (1984) study of romance readers."
9885,后文我还会再次回到这一研究，因为它是研究大众文化运作过程的一部重要的民族志著作。,I shall return to this study again because it is a major ethnographic study of the processes of popular culture at work.
9886,文本所“言说”（utter)的东西决定、限制并影响 着它和读者之间可能建立起来的关联，但是文本本身并不能建立或者控制这些联系。,"What a text ""utters"" determines, limits, and influences the links that can be made between it and its readers, but it cannot make them or control them."
9886,只有读者能够这样做。,Only readers can do that.
9886,一个文本要成为大众的，就必须“言说”读者想要说的东西，并民必须允许读者在 建构和发现文本与他们的社会情境具有的相关点时，同时参与选择文本所言说的东西（因为文本所言说的东西必然是多元的）。,"For a text to be popular, it must “utter"" what its readers wish to say, and must allow those readers to participate in their choice of its utterances (for texts must offer multiple utterances) as they construct and discover its points of pertinence in their social situation."
9887,相比之下，“言语”要受“语言体系”的限制和决定。,Parole is defined and determined by langue.
9887,它是“语言体系”才能造成的语言的实际显现，并且源于“语言体系”。,"It is the use of language made possible by, and deriving from, langue."
9887,“言语”是涉及说话和写作的各种语言单位的总和。,Parole is the sum of the linguistic units involved in speaking and writing.
9888,让我们先讲衍生文化驱力的严格性和制约性。,Let us start with the stringency and determinism of the derived imperatives of culture.
9888,整个人类，以及每个社会中的个体，在初生之际都是赤裸的机体。他们没有武器，没有防护，亦没有装备。,"Humanity as a whole, and each individual in every society, start as naked organisms, unarmed, unprotected, and unequipped."
9888,与其他动物相比，人的构造禀赋颇为有限。,"Man's anatomical endowment, compared with other animals', is somewhat limited."
9888,他缺少天然武器如利爪、尖牙、毒囊之类。,"It lacks any natural weapons, such as claws, fangs, poison receptacles."
9888,"人的牙齿不足以锯木凿石,双手不利于掘地或杀牲。","Man's teeth are not good enough for sawing wood, breaking stone, nor are his hands useful to dig the soil or to kill his prey."
9888,但作为替代，人制造出锋利而沉重的武器，能够击中远处的目标；他发明和改进工具用以掘土，用以杀死或诱捕地面、空中和水里的猎物；他借用动物的毛皮或以植物的纤维制作纺织品。,"Instead of that, man produces sharp and heavy weapons, capable of attaining even a distant aim.He invents and develops instruments to dig, to kill or trap the prey on the ground, in the air, and in the water.He borrows animal furs and prepares textiles from vegetable fiber."
9889,"库宁海姆（Cunningham,1982)告诉我们，在整个19世纪，中产阶级是怎样一以贯之地将他们的精神风尚与组织形式，强加在体育运动上。",Cunningham (1982) shows how consistently throughout the nineteenth century the middle classes attempted to impose their ethos and forms of organization upon sport.
9889,譬如足球与板球，是从它们大众的、无秩序的起源那里“偷”来的，并被重新组织而变得体面，再被转化为塑造年青绅士的品质乃至民族国家的性格的手段。,"Football and cricket, for instance, were ""stolen"" from their popular, disorderly origins, and were organized, made respectable, and turned into the means of building the character of young gentlemen, and thus of the nation."
9889,这种策略，同其他所有的控制策略-样，只在某方面成功，其相对的失败之处在于，体育运动乃沿着阶级的界线分裂开来。,"This strategy, like all strategies of control, was successful only up to a point, and its comparative failure is evidenced by the way sport split along class lines."
9889,替如业余英式橄榄球（rugby union)的参与者是一群绅士，而联盟制撤揽球（rugby league)的球员则是出身工人阶级的职业选手。,"Rugby union, for instance, became the form played by gentlemen amateurs, rugby league by working-class professionals."
9890,孩子们称正式夫人为“母亲”，不承认生母与孩子的关系。,"The child calls the legal wife 'mother,' and ties between the real mother and her child are not acknowledged."
9890,中国那种显然已成为传统习惯的东方式一夫多妻制与日本迥然不同。,"The whole Oriental arrangement of polygamy, which is so pronounced a traditional pattern in China, is thus quite un-Japanese."
9890,日本人对家庭义务与“人情”，甚至在空间上也是径渭分明的。,The Japanese keep family obligations and 'human feelings' even spatially apart.
9891,行为论的价值首先在于其研究方法的局限和长处都与人类学实地工作相似这一事实。,"The value of behaviorism is due, first and foremost, to the fact that its methods are identical as regards limitations and advantages with those of anthropological field-work."
9891,在与异文化的人打交道时，使用短路的“移情”（empathy)，即猜想其他人会有什么思想和感受，总是比较危险的。,"In dealing with people of a different culture, it is always dangerous to use the short-circuiting of ""empathy,"" which usually amounts to guessing as to what the other person might have thought or felt."
9891,实地工作者和行为论者的基本原理都认为观念、感情、意欲无论有意识或无意识，都不会在深不可测的心灵之内形成神秘和隐藏的存在。,"The fundamental principle of the field-worker, as well as of the behaviorist, is that ideas, emotions and conations never continue to lead a cryptic, hidden existence within the unexplorable depths of the mind, conscious or unconscious."
9892,伊索普关注的焦点是他所谓之“宰制性男性气质”（将异性恋的男性气质视为不言自明的核心之物，认为其坚强、专断、泰然自若、无所不知，且始终具有自我控制的能力，等等）。,"Easthope’s focus is on what he calls dominant masculinity (the myth of heterosexual masculinity as something essential and self-evident which is tough, masterful, self-possessed, knowing, always in control, etc.)."
9892,从一开始，他就指出男性气质乃是文化建构的结果，绝非“自然”、“正常”或“普适”之物。,"He begins from the proposition that masculinity is a cultural construct; that is, it is not ‘natural’, ‘normal’ or ‘universal’."
9892,宰制性的异性恋男性气质如同一套性别规范，任何与之相抵的“活的男性气质”（包括同性恋男性气质）都不得不依照其标准来自我约束。,"He argues that dominant masculinity operates as a gender norm, and that it is against this norm that the many other different types of ‘lived masculinities’ (including gay masculinities) are invited to measure themselves."
9893,列维一施特劳斯指出，神话的运行方式和语言是一样的。神话是由“神话素”构成的，就像语言是由“词素”和“音素”等单元构成的一样。,"Myths, Lévi-Strauss argues, work like language: they comprise individual ""mythemes"", analogous to individual units of language, ""morphemes"" and ""phonemes""."
9893,如词素和音素一般，神话素无法独立生成意义，而必须以某种方式被组合起来方可。,"Like morphemes and phonemes, mythemes only take on meaning when combined in particular patterns."
9894,似乎并不遵循经济决定论逻辑的媒介机构的一种典型，是公共扇形广播。,One type of media institution which does not appear to obey the logic of economic determinism is public sector broadcasting.
9894,这在英囯以英国广播公司为代表，它被期望提供一种启蒙、教育以及娱乐的媒介文化。,"This is represented in Britain by the BBC, which is supposed to provide a media culture which enlightens and educates as well as entertains."
9894,由于这种服务要由许可证费提供资金，而不是靠其产品在市场上所能要求的价格提供资金，所以它显然不会受到资本主义经济的各种压力。,"Because this service is funded primarily by a licence fee and not by the prices its products can command on the market, it is not obviously subject to capitalist pressures."
9895,1.营养补给。从这里的营养需求的直接满足人手，我们将看到人类吃、喝并非直接诉诸自然，亦非孤立状态，甚至也不是单纯的解剖学或生理学表现。,"1. Commissariat.Starting here with the direct satisfaction of the nutritive need, we would find that human beings eat and drink not by direct resort to nature, nor yet in isolation, nor yet in terms of mere anatomical or physiological performance."
9895,如果考察最初级的原始人，如澳洲土著部落、火地岛民的小群体，或者考察髙度发达的美国或欧洲杜区，我们会碰到共餐的事实。,"Were we to turn to the lowest primitives, to an Australian aboriginal tribe, to a small group of Firelanders, or to a highly sophisticated American or European community, we would come upon facts of commensalism."
9896,在那些将大众文化视为群氓文化的人们心中，曾经存在过一个“黄金 时代”；那时的文化与现在的文化有本质的不同。,Those working within the mass culture perspective usually have in mind a previous ‘golden age’ when cultural matters were very different.
9896,这一论断通常包含下述两种表述方式：有机社区（organic community)的逝去或民间文化（folk culture)的消亡。,This usually takes one of two forms: a lost organic community or a lost folk culture.
9896,"但是，正如费斯克指出的那样：“在资本主义社会里，不存在所谓的‘本真’民间文化，自然也就无法用‘本真与否’去衡量群氓文化的价值。故而，对‘本真’的哀悼注定只是沉浸在浪漫怀旧中的一种徒然无功的行为。”（Fiske, 1989a: 27)这一观点同样适用于对“逝去的有机社区”的分析。","But as Fiske (1989a) points out, ‘In capitalist societies there is no so-called authentic folk culture against which to measure the “inauthenticity” of mass culture, so bemoaning the loss of the authentic is a fruitless exercise in romantic nostalgia’ (27).This also holds true for the ‘lost’ organic community."
9896,在第四章中，我们会发现法兰克福学派（The Frankfurt School)将消逝的“黄金时代”置于未来而非过去。,"The Frankfurt School, as we shall see in Chapter 4, locate the lost golden age, not in the past, but in the future."
9897,在另一些时刻，他辩称文化产业将成年人变成孩子。他用幼稚病的比喻说法来刻画倒退听众和倒退倾听的现象。,"At other times he argues that adults are turned into children by the culture industry, using the metaphor of infantilism to characterise the regressive listener and regressive listening."
9897,他的论点是这些现象都是长时间消费文化产业产品的结果。,His case is that this results from consuming the products of the culture industry.
9898,这种理论明确地对大众社会概念的含义作了界定，并论证说工业化和都市化帮助造成了所谓的“原子化”。,"The theory argues that industrialisation and urbanisation serve to create what is called ""atomisation"".This defines precisely what is meant by a mass society."
9898,这意味着大众社会是由这样的人们构成的：他们只能像物理或化学复合物中的原子一样相互联系。,A mass society consists of people who can only relate to each other like atoms in a physical or chemical compound.
9898,大众社会由原子化的人们组成，他们相互之间缺乏任何有意义的或者在道德上的紧密联系。,"Mass society consists of atomised people, people who lack any meaningful or morally coherent relationships with each other."
9899,诚然，狗、猿、马、鸟等等，也许还应包括处于较低进化等级上的那些动物，可被教会以某种特殊方式对人的口头指令做出反应。这一情况完全属实。,"It is perfectly true, of course, that dogs, apes, horses, birds, and perhaps creatures even lower in the evolutionary scale, can be taught to respond in a specific way to a vocal command."
9899,凯洛格试验中一只名叫“小呱“的幼年黑猩猩，在一段时间内对人的语言反映大大超过了婴儿。,"Little Gua, the infant chimpanzee in the Kelloggs' experiment, was, for a time, ""considerably superior to the child in responding to human words."""
9900,第三种叙事范式是“战争的美国化”。,"The third narrative paradigm is ""the Americanization of the war""."
9900,这一表述的意味是：在好莱坞越战影片（当然还有其他美国文化产品）中，越南战争已经演变成一个纯粹的美国现象，与越南无关——我们可称之为“帝国式自恋”。,What I want to indicate by this term is the way in which the meaning of the Vietnam War has become in Hollywood's Vietnam (and elsewhere in US cultural production) an absolutely American phenomenon.
9900,在此种情结作祟下，美国成了世界的中心，越南和越南人民只不过作为美国悲剧的语境而存在，而越南人的粗蛮则最终导致了美国式纯真的迷失。,"This is an example of what we might call ""imperial narcissism"", in which the United States is centred and Vietnam and the Vietnamese exist only to provide a context for an American tragedy, whose ultimate brutality is the loss of American innocence."
9901,从很多方面看，这都不是件易事。,"This is, in many ways, a daunting task."
9901,正如托尼•本内特（Tony Bennett)所指出的那样：“从当下情况看，‘大众文化’这一概念实在无用， 它似乎把若干混沌不清乃至彼此抵触的含义塞进一个大熔炉，只会将种种对真相的探索引入理论的死胡同。,"As Tony Bennett (1980) points out, ‘as it stands, the concept of popular culture is virtually useless, a melting pot of confused and contradictory meanings capable of misdirecting inquiry up any number of theoretical blind alleys’ (18)."
9901,”（Bennett，1980: 18)此种“界定困难”一部分源自“他者”（otherness)这一概念的特殊性--当我们使用 “大众文化”这一表述时，暗示着与大众文化相对的“他者”总是缺席/在场的。,Part of the difficulty stems from the implied otherness that is always absent/ present when we use the term ‘popular culture’.
9901,在阅读后面的章节时，你也会发现我们往往有意无意地将大众文化与其他文化——民间文化、群氓文化、宰制性文化、工人阶级文化等等——进行对比，并在对比中为“大众文化”下定义。,"As we shall see in the chapters which follow, popular culture is always defined, implicitly or explicitly, in contrast to other conceptual categories: folk culture, mass culture, dominant culture, working-class culture, etc."
9902,古典人类学家并未根据有关原始民族的第一手认识撰写著述。,The classical anthropologists did not write out of first-hand knowledge of primitive people.
9902,他们是那些随心所欲利用旅行家、传教士说的逸闻趣事和早期民族学家外在的、图解式说明的书斋学者。,They were armchair students who had at their disposal the anecdotes of travellers and missionaries and the formal and schematic accounts of the early ethnologists.
9902,从这些琐事细节，追溯敲牙或者内脏占卜风俗的分布是可能的，但要理解这些特质如何根植于那些给予这种过程以形式与意义的特殊结构里的不同部落之中，则是不可能的。,"It was possible to trace from these details the distribution of the custom of knocking out teeth, or of divination by entrails, but it was not possible to see how these traits were embedded in different tribes in characteristic configurations that gave form and meaning to the procedures."
9903,对意识形态的社会决定因素的研究，目前主要有两种方法：利益论与张力论。,There are currently two main approaches to the study of the social determinants of ideology: the interest theory and the strain theory.
9903,对前者而言，意识形态是面具和武器；对后者而言，意识形态是症状及处方。,"For the first, ideology is a mask and a weapon; for the second, a symptom and a remedy."
9903,在利益论中，意识形态见解被置于为好处进行的普遍斗争的背景之中；在张力论中，则被看成是为纠正社会心理的不平衡而进行的长期努力。,"In the interest theory, ideological pronouncements are seen against the background of a universal struggle for advantage; in the strain theory, against the background of a chronic effort to correct sociopsychological disequilibrium."
9904,我们力图表明，有可能发展一套理论。该理论可将基本需求及其文化满足与新的文化需求的衍生挂钩。而且，这些新的文化需求又将一套次生型的决定机制强加于人与社会。,We shall attempt to show that a theory can be developed in which the basic needs and their cultural satisfaction can be linked up with the derivation of new cultural needs; that these new needs impose upon man and society a secondary type of determinism.
9904,我们将能把产生于诸如经济、道德、教育和政治等活动类型的功用性驱力 (instrumental imperatives)整合驱力（integrative imperatives) 区分开。,"We shall be able to distinguish between instrumental imperatives—arising out of such types of activity as economic, normative, educational and political—and integrative imperatives."
9904,后者可以知识、宗教和巫术为例。,"Here we shall list knowledge, religion, and magic."
9904,我们将能把艺术和娱乐活动与人类机体的特定生理特征直接联系，并表明它们对协作行为方式，对巫术、工业和宗教信仰等等的影响和依赖。,"Artistic and recreational activities we shall be able to relate directly to certain physiological characteristics of the human organism, and also to show their influence and dependence upon modes of concerted action, magical, industrial, and religious belief."
9905,它是他们生存本身的前提条件。,It is a prerequisite of their very existence.
9905,但是价值的这层含义也扩散开去，并恒久地与手工能力和理论知识相联系。,"This sense of value, however, also pervades and becomes permanently attached to both manual ability and theoreThe Interpretation of Culturesal knowledge."
9905,体现在所有原始技术、原始经济组织和社会组织中的科学态度，即考虑未来活动时依靠过去的经验，是一个整体的要素。我们必须假定它从人类产生之初，从这个物种刚刚开始其作为器物制作人（homo faber)、智人（homo sapiens)、政治人（homo politcus)的生涯时，就在起作用。,"The scientific attitude, embodied in all primitive technology and also in the organization of primitive economic enterprises and social organization, that reliance on past experience with the view to future performance, is an integral factor which must be assumed as having been at work from the very beginning of mankind, ever since the species started on its career as homo faber, as homo sapiens, and as homo politicus."
9905,原始共同体中，只要有一代人丧失对这种科学态度及对其价值的珍视，该群体就会沦落到动物的境地，或者更可能就此灭绝。,"Were the scientific attitude and the valuation of it to become extinct even for one generation in a primitive community, such a community would either lapse into an animal status or, more likely, become extinct."
9906,我们感兴趣的是大众化生产的都市文化，包括电影、广告、科幻小说和流行音乐。,"The area of contact was mass produced urban culture: movies, advertising, science fiction, pop music."
9906,我们感觉到大多数知识分子非但未曾对商业文化标准产生抵触情绪，反而能够坦然接受现实、讨论细节，并成为商业文化的狂热消费者。,"We felt none of the dislike of commercial culture standard among most intellectuals, but accepted it as a fact, discussed it in detail, and consumed it enthusiastically."
9906,这场运动的一个成果即是将波普文化与“逃避现实”、“纯粹娱乐”以及“消遣放松”剥离开来，进而赋予其艺术的严肃性。,"One result of our discussions was to take Pop culture out of the realm of ‘escapism’, ‘sheer entertainment’, ‘relaxation’, and to treat it with the seriousness of art."
9907,如果我们认为意识形态是一个非系统性的指意的集合，那么批评家的工作就是通过将这些指意整合为符号的方式来解读文本。,"If ideology is thought of as a non-systematic ensemble of significations, the work proposes a reading of these significations, by combining them as signs."
9907,文化批评教会了我们分析符号的方法。,
9907,,"Criticism teaches us to read these signs""."
9907,在这个意义上，马施立的批评实践试图说明：文学文本是如何通过赋予意识形态以具体形式的方式，在自相矛盾之中对意识形态加以呈现的。,"In this way, Machereyan critical practice seeks to explain the way in which, by giving ideology form, the literary text displays ideology in contradiction with itself."
9908,至于我们所要探讨的“大众文化”，则需灵活运用文化的第二个和第三个定义。,To speak of popular culture usually means to mobilize the second and third meanings of the word ‘culture’.
9908,定义之二--文化作为一种特别的生活方式——要求我们去研究人类的某些具体活动，诸如海滨度假、圣诞庆典、青年亚文化等。,"The second meaning – culture as a particular way of life – would allow us to speak of such practices as the seaside holiday, the celebration of Christmas, and youth subcultures, as examples of culture."
9908,我们通常称此类活动为“活的” (lived)文化或实践。,These are usually referred to as lived cultures or practices.
9908,而定义之三——文化作为指意实践——则将肥皂剧、流行音乐、连环漫画等纳入了文化研究的范畴，我们称其为“文本”(text)。,"The third meaning – culture as signifying practices – would allow us to speak of soap opera, pop music, and comics, as examples of culture.These are usually referred to as texts."
9908,甚少人会在思考大众文化相关问题时想到威廉斯为文化所下的第一个定义。,Few people would imagine Williams’s first definition when thinking about popular culture.
9909,它是他们生存本身的前提条件。,It is a prerequisite of their very existence.
9909,但是价值的这层含义也扩散开去，并恒久地与手工能力和理论知识相联系。,"This sense of value, however, also pervades and becomes permanently attached to both manual ability and theoretical knowledge."
9909,体现在所有原始技术、原始经济组织和社会组织中的科学态度，即考虑未来活动时依靠过去的经验，是一个整体的要素。我们必须假定它从人类产生之初，从这个物种刚刚开始其作为器物制作人（homo faber)、智人（homo sapiens)、政治人（homo politcus)的生涯时，就在起作用。,"The scientific attitude, embodied in all primitive technology and also in the organization of primitive economic enterprises and social organization, that reliance on past experience with the view to future performance, is an integral factor which must be assumed as having been at work from the very beginning of mankind, ever since the species started on its career as homo faber, as homo sapiens, and as homo politicus."
9909,原始共同体中，只要有一代人丧失对这种科学态度及对其价值的珍视，该群体就会沦落到动物的境地，或者更可能就此灭绝。,"Were the scientific attitude and the valuation of it to become extinct even for one generation in a primitive community, such a community would either lapse into an animal status or, more likely, become extinct."
9910,"在科贝特论著中表现出的另一而是,19世纪社会批评的一大特色是把中世纪理想化，他在这件事上应负重要责任。",The other aspect of Cobbett's work is his surprising share of responsibility for that idealization of the Middle Ages which is so characteristic of nineteenth-century social criticism.
9910,"作为一个文学运动,中世纪主义自18世纪中叶以来即不断发展。","As a literary movement, mediaevalism had been growing since the middle of the eighteenth century."
9910,对科贝特来说，中世纪主义最重要的一个方面是以修道院作为社会机构的标准:另行建立一个公社式的社会以取代个人主义。,"Its most important aspect, for Cobbett, was its use of the monasteries as a standard for social institutions: the image of the working of a communal society as a welcome alternative to the claims of individualism."
9911,在对那种与我们邻人不同的行为（不论这种不同是多么细微）予以担忧的方面，中型城镇则是我们都市的典型例子。,Middletown is a typical example of our usual urban fear of seeming in however slight an act different from our neighbours.
9911,在反常与阿谀之间，人们更害怕前者。,Eccentricity is more feared than parasitism.
9911,为了使家人一个都不背上任何分裂的污名，人们为此在时间和平静方面都做出了极大牺牲。,Every sacrifice of time and tranquillity is made in order that no one in the family may have any taint of nonconfomity attached to him.
9912,什么是“种族遗传特性”？,For what is ‘racial inheritance'?
9912,从父亲到儿子，我们大概就可知道什么是遗传了。,We know roughly what heredity is from father to son.
9912,在家族血统中，遗传的重要性无比巨大，但它仅是家族血统的事。,Within a family line the importance of heredity is tremendous.But heredity is an affair of family lines.
9912,超越此界，它便是神话。,Beyond that it is mythology.
9913,首先，有人认为，葛兰西的理论只不过代表了主导意识形态命题的另一个变种。,"There is, first, the claim that Gramsci's theory represents merely another variant of the dominant ideology thesis."
9913,在霸权概念的出现及其历史变化方面，葛兰西所提的矛盾斗争极为重要。,Gramsci stresses the importance of conflict for the emergence of hegemony and historical changes.
9913,还有，人们一般都会证明这一事实：统治集团实际能够获得确保其统治某种霸权形式。,"None the  less, it is usual for dominant groups to assert hegemony to secure their rule."
9913,霸权可能是阶级矛盾的结果，但它也是一种以牺牲各种从属集团一方为代价、一直有利于斗争的统治集团一方的结果。,"Hegemony is a consequence of class conflict, but it continually favours one side of the struggle rather than the other: the dominant group at the expense of the subordinate groups."
9914,在我们自己的主导特质尚是一个活着的问题的时候，对它进行评价就为时过早。,Appraisal of our own dominant traits has so far waited till the trait in question was no longer a living issue.
9914,宗教也不会得到客观的讨论，除非它已不再是深深影响我们文明的文化特质。,Religion was not objectively discussed till it was no longer the cultural trait to which our civilization was most deeply committed.
9914,今天，我们对宗教的比较研究，才能自由地探索该问题的各个方面。,Now for the first time the comparative study of religions is free to pursue any point at issue.It is not yet possible to discuss capitalism in the same way.
9914,同理，讨论资本主义在今天仍不可能；在战时，战争和国际关系问题也同样成为禁忌。,"And during wartime,welfare and the problems of international relations are similarly tabu."
9915,该学派对资本主义的分析，似乎设想了一个找到了永恒稳定之秘诀的社会。,"The School""s analysis of capitalism appears to be of a society which has discovered the secret of eternal stability."
9915,资本主义在文化工业中找到了各种手段，它们可以有效地遏制各种激进的与替代的社会力量对它构成的威胁。,The culture industry provides capitalism with the means by which it can effectively contain any threats posed to it by radical and alternative social forces.
9915,资本主义的确越来越有能力压制所有此类的社会力量。,"Indeed, it is increasingly capable of suppressing such social forces altogether."
9915,这种稳定和一致的程度，很难与社会学和资本主义社会的历史相吻合。,This degree of stability and consensus is hardly consistent with the sociology and history of capitalist societies.
9916,他论证说，正是较广泛的社会力量和阶级利益，才支配着各种写作风格的形成和变化。,He argues that it is wider social forces and class interests which govern the formation and transformation of writing styles.
9916,19世纪各种新的阶级利益和冲突的出现，结果便是古典风格的崩溃。,The emergence of new class interests and conflicts in the nineteenth century results in the breakdown of the classical style.
9916,这种风格尽管很做作，巴特还是把它解释为资产阶级霸权崛起的一个方面，因而是一种“阶级特色”。,"Barthes interprets this style, despite its pretensions, as an aspect of the rise of bourgeois hegemony, and thus as a ""class idiom""."
9917,根据巴特的观点，资产阶级意识形态的特征是要否认资产阶级的存在。,"According to Barthes, bourgeois ideology characteristically denies the existence of a bourgeois class."
9917,他写道：“作为一种意识形态事实，它完全消失了：资产阶级已把它的名字顺便从现实到表现、从经济上的人到心理上的人抹掉了”。,"He writes: ""as an ideological fact, it completely disappears: the bourgeoisie has obliterated its name in passing from reality to representation, from economic man to mental man""."
9917,这是一个没有名字的阶级，因为神话起到了意识形态的作用以确保它不被命名。,This is a class with no name because myth functions as ideology to ensure that it is not named.
9918,例如，下雨是由其它气象现象为先导的，并伴随着降水现象；化石不过是古生物学诸事件之链条中的一个环节。,"Thus, rain falls because other meteorologic phenomena precede and accompany rainfall; a fossil is merely a link in a chain of paleontologic events."
9918,在这种哲学类型中，解释是由对相关事件的详尽说明而构成的，科学解释因而成为简要的描述。,Explanation in this type of philosophy consists of a recitation of relevant events; scientific explanation is thus condensed description.
9918,这是自然主义的哲学。,This is the philosophy of naturalism.
9919,最终，弗洛伊德通过三个术语对人类的精神世界作出了划分：自我、超我和本我。三者间的相互关系。,"Freud’s final model of the psyche introduces three new terms: the ego, the super-ego, and the id."
9919,本我是人类存在中的最原始的部分，是“我们只遵循自然法则的非人格化的天性”，是“我们人性之中最黑暗、最艰于触摸的部分……无比混乱，仿佛是充满沸腾的刺激的巨大汽锅……尽管始终激发着蠢蠢欲动的本能之力，却不服从任何既定规则和集体意愿……它的一切目的就是遵循快乐原则，想尽办法满足本能的需求”。,"The id is the most primitive part of our being.It is the part of ‘our nature [which] is impersonal, and, so to speak, subject to natural law’; it‘is the dark, inaccessible part of our personality...a chaos, a cauldron full of seething excitations....It is filled with energy reaching it from the instincts, but it has no organization, produces no collective will, but only a striving to bring about the satisfaction of the instinctual needs subject to the observance of the pleasure principle’."
9920,自由泰国运动此时看似死寂，但是它可能因为泰国的外交政策发生变化，或者甚至是巴特寮在老挝取得胜利而死灰复燃。,"The Free Thai movement seems dead at the moment, but it could revive with a change in Thailand's foreign policy or even with Pathet success in Laos."
9920,伊拉克的库尔德人表面上已经几次平息下去，但是持续显示着不平静的迹象。诸如此类的现象不胜枚举。,"Iraq's Kurds, several times ostensibly mollified, continue to show signs of restlessness."
9920,,And so on.
9921,两个因素决定了国家的必要性。,Two factors make the State necessary.
9921,首先，昔日稳居权力中心的贵族集团已经衰落；其次，民主制度正在冉冉升起。,"First, the decline of the aristocracy as a centre of authority; second, the rise of democracy."
9921,两者的结合为无政府状态提供了肥沃的土壤。,Together they create a terrain favourable to anarchy.
9921,要想解决这个问题，必须以文化和强权为武器来“抢占地盘”。,The solution is to occupy this terrain with a mixture of culture and coercion.
9922,流行音乐的第二个特征是：它使得听音乐变成了一个消极被动的过程。,Adorno’s second claim is that popular music promotes passive listening.
9922,前文曾经提到过，资本主义制度下的劳动是极为枯燥的，因此每个人都在想方设法逃避现实。但是，由于这种劳动使人非常疲惫，所以没有人真正有本事“逃出去”。,"As already noted, work under capitalism is dull and therefore promotes the search for escape, but, because it is also dulling, it leaves little energy for real escape--the demands of ‘authentic’ culture."
9923,霸权的“均势妥协”还可被用来分析大众文化内部及大众文化所折射出的其他类型的冲突。,The compromise equilibrium of hegemony can also be employed to analyse different types of conflict within and across popular culture.
9923,本内特强调的是阶级冲突，除此之外，族裔、“种族”、性别、代际、性征、身体缺陷等范畴内的冲突也同样适用，因为所有这些冲突都在不同的情况下参与到了旨在对抗主流或宰制性力量之收编的文化斗争之中。,"Bennett highlights class conflict, but hegemony theory can also be used to explore and explain conflicts involving ethnicity, ‘race’, gender, generation, sexuality, disability, etc.– all are at different moments engaged in forms of cultural struggle against the homogenizing forces of incorporation of the official or dominant culture."
9923,在对霸权理论的应用中，尤其是在后马克思主义的文化研究范式中（参见第四章），最关键的概念是“接合”①(arThe Interpretation of Culturesulation;此处本词同时表达了两层意思，一是“表达自己的观点”，二是“与对方建立临时的关联”）。,"The key concept in this use of hegemony theory, especially in post-Marxist cultural studies (see Chapter 4), is the concept of ‘arThe Interpretation of Culturesulation’ (the word being employed in its double sense to mean both to express and to make a temporary connection)."
9924,大众文化的文本与实践就在葛兰西所谓的“均势妥协”中流动。,The texts and practices of popular culture move within what Gramsci calls a ‘compromise equilibrium’.
9924,这一过程既是历时性的（在某一时期被贴上“大众文化”标签的文化，在另一时期也许就成了其他文化），又是共时性的（无论在哪个特定的历史时期，大众文化都在“抵抗”与“收编”之间游弋）。,"The process is historical (labelled popular culture one moment, and another kind of culture the next), but it is also synchronic (moving between resistance and incorporation at any given historical moment)."
9924,例如，海滨休假一度是贵族的特权，不到一百年却成了大众文化的范例。,"For instance, the seaside holiday began as an aristocratic event and within a hundred years it had become an example of popular culture."
9924,黑色电影起初只是一种广遭贬斥的大众电影类型，但不到三十年就摇身一变，顶上了艺术电影的光环。,Film started as despised popular cinema and within thirty years had become art cinema.
9924,大体上，霸权理论认为大众文化毋宁说是统治阶级与被统治阶级、统治者文化与被统治者文化进行意识形态斗争的力场。,"In general terms, those looking at popular culture from the perspective of hegemony theory tend to see it as a terrain of ideological struggle between dominant and subordinate classes, dominant and subordinate cultures."
9925,而且，流行音乐还反映了青少年在处理情感问题与性纠结时所遭遇的困境，让他们体会到了热情拥抱生活的需要。,"Moreover, pop songs reflect adolescent difficulties in dealing with a tangle of emotional and sexual problems.They invoke the need to experience life directly and intensely."
9925,在充满不确定性和可变性的情感世界里，流行歌曲仿若一种安全的驱动力。,They express the drive for security in an uncertain and changeable emotional world.
9925,尽管商业市场的背景决定了流行音乐缺乏某种本真性，但它却以戏剧化的方式表达了真实可触的感受，几乎就是青少年情感世界的写照。,The fact that they are produced for a commercial market means that the songs and settings lack a certain authenticity.Yet they dramatize authentic feelings.They express vividly the adolescent emotional dilemma.
9926,弗雷泽是人类学一个时代的代表。这个时代随着他的去世而结束。,Frazer is the representative of an epoch in anthropology which ends with his death.
9926,纵观他所有直接的理论贡献，可以说他是一名对“原始人”（primitive）感兴趣的进化论者，不论这是指广义的人类，还是指当代“野蛮人”的特殊信仰、习俗和实践。,"In all his directly theoreThe Interpretation of Culturesal contributions he is an evolutionist, interested in the ""primitive,"" whether this refers to mankind at large, or to specific beliefs, customs and pracThe Interpretation of Cultureses of contemporary ""savages."""
9926,他用比较方法进行研究，收集和检验从世界各地、处在所有发展水平上和所有文化中的证据。,"He works by the comparative method, collecting and examining evidence from all parts of the world, at all levels of development, and in all cultures."
9926,比较方法与进化方式的结合就意味着特定的普遍假设：人在本质上相似；他们从原始水平经过各个进化阶段而逐步发展。,The comparative method combined with the evolutionary approach implies certain general assumptions.Men are substantially similar.They develop gradually from a primitive level and pass through various stages of evolution.
9927,在文章中，阿多诺指出流行音乐具有三个主要特征。,In the essay he makes three specific claims about popular music.
9927,第一，流行音乐是“标准化”的音乐。,"First, he claims that it is ""standardised""."
9927,“标准化”使得“那些即使是最独特的东西也变得乏善可陈”。,"""Standardisation"" as Adorno points out, ""extends from the most general features to the most specific ones""."
9927,"一旦某种音乐或歌词风格受到欢迎,那么这种风格就会遭到商业的滥用，造成的结果就是“标准的结晶化”。","Once a musical and/or lyrical pattern has proved successful it is exploited to commercial exhaustion, culminating in ""the crystallisation of standards""."
9928,当然，在此还有必要引入时间要素，即变迁要素。,"It will also be necessary, of course, to introduce the element of time, that is, of change."
9928,我们在此试图证明，所有文化进化或传播过程都首先以制度变迁的形式发生。,"Here we shall attempt to show that all evolutionary or diffusion processes happen, first and foremost, in the form of institutional change."
9928,无论是以发明的形式还是以传播的行动，新的技术装置总要被结合到业已确立的组织化行为系统之中，并逐渐对原有制度产生全部的重塑。,"Whether in the form of invention, or as an act of diffusion, a new technical device becomes incorporated into an already established system of organized behavior, and produces gradually a complete remolding of that institution."
9928,另外，根据功能分析，我们可以证明，除非有新的需求被创造出来，任何发明、任何革命、任何社会或知识的变迁都不会发生。因而技术、知识或信仰方面的新装置都要适合于文化过程或某种制度。,"Again, in terms of our functional analysis, we will show that no invention, no revolution, no social or intellectual change, ever occurs except when new needs are created; and thus new devices in technique, in knowledge, or in belief are fitted into the cultural process or an institution."
9929,然而，即使在有记载的历史领域里，那些能让我们构拟一段真正科学的历史的资料都很薄弱。它们通常至多允许一种知识性、描述性的片面构拟，就像我们在泰恩、兰普雷克特和马克斯•韦伯的著作中所读到的那样。,"Even within the realm of recorded history, however, data which would allow us to reconstruct a really scientific history are very scanty, and usually allow, at best, such intelligent and illuminating partial reconstructions as we find in the writings of Taine, Lamprecht, or Max Weber."
9929,而且，就如我们批评比较或播化论方法时指出的：结果的价值取决于我们对所研究的制度的枓学定义。,"Once more, as in our criticism of the comparative or diffusionist methods, the value of the results depends on the really scientific definition of the institution which we follow in our inquiry."
9929,在人类学用语中，“历史”或“历史的”这两词，就我所能看到的而言，还从未能够被令人满意地定义过。,"In anthropological parlance, the terms ""history"" and ""historical"" have, so far as I can see, never been satisfactorily defined."
9930,播化作为一种文化过程，和进化一样，是真实存在和无可攻击的。,Diffusion as a cultural process is as real and unassailable as evolution.
9930,这两种过程之间看来也实在难觅其异。,It seems certain that no distinction can be made between the two processes.
9930,况且，尽管两个学派的支持者有些不肯妥协和敌视态度，但他们都从不同角度研究了文化成长问題，并为说明这个问题独立地做出了各自的贡献。,"The votaries of either school, however, in spite of their somewhat intransigent and hostile attitude to each other, have approached the problem of culture growth from different angles and have contributed to its illumination independently."
9930,播化学派的真正功绩在于，他们更加注重具体实在的事物，历史感更强，尤其是他们对环境和地理影响的认识。,"The real merit of the diffusionist school consists in their greater concreteness, fuller historical sense, and, above all, in their realization of environmental and geographical influences."
9931,运动战是指以迅速、决定性地取胜为目的，对敌人进行快速的、正面的和直接的攻击。,"War of movement refers to a swift, frontal and direct attack on the enemy with the aim of winning quickly and decisively."
9931,这类似于政治上的起义行动。,This is comparable to insurrectionary political action.
9931,它可以描述1917年的布尔什维克革命，这场革命涉及到一场运动战，针对的是由不受市民社会保护的、集中化的国家统治政权所提供的目标。,"It describes the bolshevik revolution of 1917 in Russia, which involved a war of movement against the political target provided by a centralised and dominant state power left unprotected by civil society."
9931,"市民社会中的霸权是软弱的，而国家则是强大的和极其明显的,所以反对这个国家的一场革命运动战便可以进行下去。","Hegemony in civil society was weak while the state was strong and highly visible, so a revolutionary war of movement against the state could be mounted and concluded successfully."
9932,假若超级真实主义真有道理，那也绝不像许多鲍德里亚主义者妄图表明的那样，意味着人们已经失去分辨虚构世界与真实世界的能力——事实是，在很大程度上，虚构与真实之间的界限已经变得越来越无足轻重了。,"If hyperrealism means anything, it cannot with any credibility signal a decline in people’s ability to distinguish between fiction and reality.It is not, as some Baudrillardians seem to want to suggest, that people can no longer tell the difference between fiction and reality: it is that in some significant ways the distinction between the two has become less and less important."
9932,为何会出现此种状况？这本身就是个耐人寻味的问题。,Why this has happened is itself an important question.
9932,不过我认为，单凭“超级真实主义”这个概念，我们很难找到答案。,But I do not think that hyperrealism really supplies us with the answer.
9933,这种观点对他们是陌生的。,The idea is foreign to them.
9933,更确切地说他们认为，超自然物喜人之所喜，人喜欢跳舞，它亦喜欢跳舞。,"They reckon, rather, that the supernaturals like what men like, and if men like dancing so will the supernaturals."
9933,因此，在祖尼，人们用戴面具的方式把超自然物引入舞蹈，然后取出药束，使它们 “起舞”。,"Therefore they bring the supernaturals back to dance in Zuni by donning their masks, they take out the medicine bundles and 'dance' them."
9933,这会给它们以愉悦。,It gives thempleasure.
9933,甚至还必须使仓里的玉米跳舞。,Even the corn in the storeroom must be danced.
9934,大名在每个藩中居于等级制的最高地位，对其属下可以行使特权。,The daimyo stood at the apex of the hierarchy in each fief and he was allowed to exercise his prerogatives over his dependents.
9934,将军在行政上最主要的任务就是控制大名。,The Shogun's great administrative problem was to control the daimyo.
9934,他采取一切手段防止大名之间结盟或推行侵犯计划。,In every way he prevented them from forming alliances or from carrying out schemes of aggression.
9935,文化的第三个含义与结构主义者以及后结构主义者所声称的“指意实践”（signifying practices)大体相同（参见第六章）。,Culture in this third definition is synonymous with what structuralists and post-structuralists call ‘signifying practices’ (see Chapter 6).
9935,如果用第三种定义来看待文化，那么诗歌、小说、芭蕾、歌剧和美术都将被纳人考察的范畴。,"Using this definition, we would probably think of examples such as poetry, the novel, ballet, opera, and fine art."
9935,至于我们所要探讨的“大众文化”，则需灵活运用文化的第二个和第三个定义。,To speak of popular culture usually means to mobilize the second and third meanings of the word ‘culture’.
9935,定义之二——文化作为 一种特别的生活方式——要求我们去研究人类的某些具体活动，诸如海滨度假、圣诞庆典、青年亚文化等。,"The second meaning – culture as a particular way of life – would allow us to speak of such practices as the seaside holiday, the celebration of Christmas, and youth subcultures, as examples of culture."
9935,我们通常称此类活动为“活的” (lived)文化或实践。,These are usually referred to as lived cultures or practices.
9936,过去，工人就生活在自己创造的文化中；而现在，工人已完全置身于文化之外。,"Whereas in the past a worker lived in his or her work, he or she now works in order to live outside his or her work."
9936,工业化造成的后果之一就是工人们已经“被自己的作品搞得疲弱无力”。,"But as a result of industrialization, the experience of work has deteriorated to such an extent that workers are actually ‘incapacitated by their work’."
9936,休闲娱乐带给工人们的并不是“再创造”（再创造劳动中失去的东西），而是“创造无力”（劳动过程中失去的东西的混合体）。,"Therefore, instead of recreation (re-creating what is lost in work), leisure provides workers with only ‘decreation’ (a compounding of the loss experienced through work)."
9936,情况如此，难怪人们会向群氓文化寻求情感补偿和被动娱乐。毒品开始大行其道，每个人都成了沉溺于“生活替代品”中的瘾君子。,"Given such a situation, it is little wonder that people turn to mass culture for compensation and passive distraction; the drug habit develops and they become junkies addicted to ‘substitute living’."
9936,田园牧歌的世界不复存在，取而代之的是乏味平庸的“近郊主义”。,A world of rural rhythms has been lost to the monotony and mediocrity of ‘suburbanism.’
9937,群体形成的分群（grouping)的另一条通则是接近（propinguity)和接触（contiguity)。,Another general principle of grouping is that of propinquity and contiguity.
9937,社会生活的本质是合作。,The essence of social life is cooperation.
9937,"当人们相互近在咫尺时,只能交换服务、一同工作以及在任务和才干上彼此依赖互补。","People can only exchange services, work together, and rely on supplementing each other as regards task and ability, when they are within reach."
9938,在日本，等级制一直是日本有文字历史以来生活中的准则，甚至可以追溯到公元七世纪。那时，日本已经从无等级的中国吸取生活方式，使之适应其自身的等级制文化。,In Japan caste has been the rule of life through all her recorded history and even back in the seventh century A.D. she was already adapting the ways of life she borrowed from casteless China to suit her own hierarchal culture.
9938,在七到八世纪时，日本的天皇及其宫廷已经着手进行要用中国那种使日本使节赞叹不已的高度文明习俗来充实日本的事业。,"In that era of the seventh and eighth centuries, the Japanese Emperor and his court set themselves the task of enriching Japan with the customs of the high civilization that had greeted the amazed eyes of their envoys in the great kingdom of China."
9939,斯戴西的观点对大多数电影精神分析的普适主义论调提出了指责。,Stacey’s work represents something of a rebuke to the universalistic claims of much cine-psychoanalysis.
9939,经由细致的受众研究，“女性的观影行为理应被视作与好莱坞电影宰制性意义进行的协商，而非仅仅被动受制于后者的过程”。,"By studying the audience, ‘female spectatorship might be seen as a process of negotiating the dominant meanings of Hollywood cinema, rather than one of being passively positioned by it’."
9939,由此视角出发，一度牢不可破、天衣无缝的好莱坞父权力量开始动摇，其意识形态上的成功亦绝非天经地义。,"From this perspective, Hollywood’s patriarchal power begins to look less monolithic, less seamless, its ideological success never guaranteed."
9940,要成为大众的，一个大众的文本必须能够在各式各样的社会语境中，对于各式各样的读者具有相关点。因此，它本身必须 具有多元的意义，任何一种解读方式必须是有条件的，因为它必须被它解读的社会条件所决定。,"A popular text, to be popular, must have points of relevance to a variety of readers in a variety of social contexts, and so must be polysemic in itself, and any one reading of it must be conditional, for it must be determined by the social conditions of its reading."
9940,相关性要求意义的多元性与相对性，拒绝封闭性、绝对性和普遍性。,"Relevance requires polysemy and relativity—it denies closure, absolutes, and universals."
9941,因此，列维-斯特劳斯根据这样的假设建立了一个二元对立的和可能的置换格栅：图腾崇拜现象是各种社会中较为基本的和普遍的倾向在经验上的一种显现，即根据事物的性质（如动物或植物）来划分社会文化事物（如群体或部落）。图腾崇拜提供了一种包含个体和集体的社会（文化）事物的非社会（自然）体现。自然事物包括物类和特殊者。文化事物包括群体和个体。,"Lévi- Strauss constructs a grid of binary oppositions and possible permutations based on two assumptions: that totemism provides a nonsocial (natural) representation of the social (cultural) which is both individual and collective; and that the natural consists of categories and particulars, and the cultural of groups and persons."
9942,所谓法兰克福学派，指的是一个以法兰克福大学社会研究所为大本营的德国知识分子群体。,The Frankfurt School is the name given to a group of German intellectuals associated with the Institute for Social Research at the University of Frankfurt.
9942,该研究所成立于1923年，并于希特勒上台后的1933年迁至美国纽约，隶属于哥伦比亚大学。,"The Institute was established in 1923.Following the coming to power of Hitler in 1933, it moved to New York, attaching itself to the University of Columbia."
9942,1949年，研究所再度迁回德国。,In 1949 it moved back to Germany.
9942,法兰克福学派的主要研究风格混合了马克思主义和精神分析学说，常常被人们称为“批判理论”。,‘Critical Theory’ is the name given to the Institute’s critical mix of Marxism and psychoanalysis.
9943,于是，杰斐逊飞机乐队反资本主义政治理念的传播反而为其所属的资本主义唱片公司带来了滚滚财源。这也是一个体现了接合过程的例子。社会中的统治阶级通过与反抗者的声音“协商”的方式将其引至某个安全地带，从而确保自身的领导权得以维系。反传统文化并非一无是处（毫无疑问，这种音乐产生了特定的文化效应和政治效应），但它终究还是成了支持战争且唯利是图的资本主义音乐工业的同谋。,"""The proliferation of Jefferson Airplane’s anti-capitalist politics increased the profits of their capitalist record company. Again, this is an example of the process of articulation: the way in which dominant groups in society attempt to ‘negotiate’ oppositional voices on to a terrain which secures for the dominant groups a continued position of leadership. The music of the counterculture was not denied expression (and there can be little doubt that this music produced particular cultural and political effects), but what is also true is that this music was articulated in the economic interests of the war-supporting capitalist music industry."""
9944,在日本，分娩与性交一样隐秘。产妇在阵痛时不能大声呻吟以避免让人知道。,Childbirth is as private in Japan as sexual intercourse and women may not cry out in labor because this would publicize it.
9944,母亲要提前给婴儿准备新被褥和小床，因为，新生婴儿不睡新床不吉利。,A little pallet bed has been prepared for the baby with its own new mattress and bedcover.
9944,贫苦家庭买不起新床，也要把被料和棉花洗净，作成“新”被。,"It would be a bad omen for the child not to have its own now bed, even if the family can do no more than have the quilt covers and the stuffing cleaned and renovated to make them 'new.'"
9944,小被褥也不象大人的那样板硬，而且很轻。,The little bed quilt is not as stiff as grown-ups' covers and it is lighter.
9945,要表明食品生产及其分配是组织化的行为体系，并证明它们构成部落或国家营养补给的一部分就更容易。,"It is less difficult to show that production of food and its distribution are organized behavior systems, and that they form part of the tribal or national commissariat."
9945,说到对大型企业的控制、征税，有时甚至是组织，部落或国家也时常插手其事。,"Very often the tribe or the state enters into this, insofar as large-scale enterprise is controlled, taxed, and occasionally even organized."
9945,一方面，在某些文化状态下，食品生产、分配、制作和消费是在同一制度——即家户内实现。,"There are, on the one hand, cultural conditions in which production, distribution, preparation, and consumption of food are carried out within the same institution, that is, the household."
9946,在以后的五年中，又从法律上废除了等级间的不平等及作为等级、地位的服饰、徽章等外观标志，甚至下令“散发”（指“散发脱刀今”，1871年公布。准许自由剪发，废除佩刀，以破除旧习，提倡“文明开化”。）。贱民被解放了。,"Within the next five years all legal inequality among the classes was summarily abolished, insignia and distinctive dress of caste and class were outlawed—even queues had to be cut,—the outcasts were emancipated, the laws against alienation of land withdrawn, the barriers that had separated fief from fief were removed and Buddhism was disestablished."
9946,废除了禁止土地转让的法令。,
9946,撤除了各藩之间的关卡。,
9946,取消了佛教的国教地位。,
9947,弗洛伊德称：“我要郑重提醒大家，绝不可过分强调意象分析在释梦过程中的重要性，不能将对梦境的阐释简化为对象征符号的分析。要想充分解读梦的含义，就必须深人考察做梦者与梦境之间发生缔合的机制。,"As he warns: ""I should like to utter an express warning against overestimating the importance of symbols in dream-interpre-tation, against restricting the work of translating dreams merely to translating symbols and against abandoning the technique of making use of the dreamer's associations""."
9947,”尤其是，同一个象征符号“往往具有多重含义……要想作出正确的解读，就必须结合情境，做到具体问题具体分析”；而所谓“情境”，则是由做梦者自己构建的。,"Moreover, symbols ""frequently have more than one or even several meanings, and . . . the correct interpretation can only be arrived at on each occasion from the context"".Again, context will be something established by the dreamer."
9948,诸多困难源自他者的缺失。不管使用何种释义，他者这一概念一直困扰着我们。,A great deal of the difficulty arises from the absent other which always haunts any definition we might use.
9948,大众文化是一个说不完、道不尽的话题，而我们总是在对比之中来理解大众文化。,It is never enough to speak of popular culture; we have always to acknowledge that with which it is being contrasted.
9948,无论与大众文化相对的“他者”是什么——是群氓文化、高雅文化，还是工人阶级文化、民间文化，等等——概念本身都会因之而发生理论或政治意义上的变化。,"And whichever of popular culture’s others we employ, mass culture, high culture, working-class culture, folk culture, etc., it will carry into the definition of popular culture a specific theoretical and political inflection."
9948,"正如本内特所指出的：“对此问题，绝无‘万无一失’的解决方法;却有一系列互不相同的解决途径，每一种途径都会带来不同的释义、产生不同的影响。""（Bennett, 1982a: 86)本书的主要意图在于：在文化理论与大众文化之错综复杂的关系中，为各种各样的问题及其纷繁的解决路径绘制一个学科地图。","‘There is’, as Bennett (1982a) indicates, ‘no single or “correct” way of resolving these problems; only a series of different solutions which have different implications and effects’ (86).The main purpose of this book is to chart the many problems encountered, and the many solutions suggested, in cultural theory’s complex engagement with popular culture."
9949,例如，人们可能坚信文化应当是“复杂的”；也就是说，“真正的”文化必须是很难被人理解的。,"For example, we might want to insist on formal complexity.In other words, to be real culture, it has to be difficult."
9949,只有这样，所谓的“髙雅文化”才具有排他性。,Being difficult thus ensures its exclusive status as high culture.
9949,文化的这种排他性是真实存在的，它同时决定了髙雅文化的受众也具有相应的排他性。,"Its very difficulty literally excludes, an exclusion that guarantees the exclusivity of its audience."
9950,最后有人找到了摆脱这个绝境的捷径。,Finally some one broke a way out of the impasse.
9950,他用简单明了的语言宣布：全部“戈尔索克”问题从始至终都不过是些“传闻、传闻、传闻”而已，几个世纪以来，智者们一直追踪着这些传闻的踪迹，而结果是“并不比过去更接近于找到答案。”,"He declared in plain language that the whole Golshok business, from start to finish, was nothing but ""words, words, words,"" that the wise men had been chasing their tails for centuries, with ""the solution no nearer now than then."""
9951,那些被称为“阁下”的新领导人为了向国民推行他们的卓越政纲，甚至加强了中央集权的统治。,"‘Their Excellencies,' the new leaders of Japan, even strengthened centralized rule in order to 'impose their own workmanlike programs upon the people."
9951,他们交替使用施加压力和给予恩惠的办法，思威并施，以求贯彻目的。,They alternated demands from above with gifts from above and in this way they managed to survive.
9951,但是，在公共舆论不赞成改用太阳历、设立公共学校及废除对贱民的不平等待遇等等时，他们丝毫也没想要去迎合。,But they did not imagine that they had to cater to a public opinion which might not want to reform the calendar or to establish public schools or to outlaw discrimination against the outcasts.
9952,阿诺德未曾给大众文化下一个明确的定义。,Popular culture is never actually defined.
9952,然而，在通读阿诺德的著作之后我们不难发现：所谓的“无政府状态”在一定程度上成了大众文化的代名词，阿诺德正是用这个词来描述工人阶级的活文化先天具有的某种破坏性的特质的。他尤其坚信，从1867年城市中的男性工人阶级成员正式参与到政治生活之中开始，政治上的危险便已不可避免了。,"However, it becomes clear when reading through Arnold""s work that the term ""anarchy"" operates in part as a synonym for popular culture. Specifically, anarchy/popular culture is used to refer to Arnold""s conception of the supposedly disruptive nature of working-class lived culture: the political dangers that he believes to be inevitably concomitant with the entry of the male urban working class into formal politics in 1867."
9953,诸多困难源自他者的缺失。不管使用何种释义，他者这一概念一直困扰着我们。,A great deal of the difficulty arises from the absent other which always haunts any definition we might use.
9953,大众文化是一个说不完、道不尽的话题，而我们总是在对比之中来理解大众文化。,It is never enough to speak of popular culture; we have always to acknowledge that with which it is being contrasted.
9953,无论与大众文化相对的“他者”是什么——是群氓文化、高雅文化，还是工人阶级文化、民间文化，等等——概念本身都会因之而发生理论或政治意义上的变化。,"And whichever of popular culture’s others we employ, mass culture, high culture, working-class culture, folk culture, etc., it will carry into the definition of popular culture a specific theoretical and political inflection."
9953,"正如本内特所指出的：“对此问题，绝无‘万无一失’ 的解决方法;却有一系列互不相同的解决途径，每一种途径都会带来不同的释义、产生不同的影响。""（Bennett, 1982a: 86)本书的主要意图在于：在文化理论与大众文化之错综复杂的关系中，为各种各样的问题及其纷繁的解决路径绘制一个学科地图。","‘There is’, as Bennett (1982a) indicates, ‘no single or “correct” way of resolving these problems; only a series of different solutions which have different implications and effects’ (86).The main purpose of this book is to chart the many problems encountered, and the many solutions suggested, in cultural theory’s complex engagement with popular culture."
9954,反功能论者会抗议说，毕 竟有些文化根本不用羹匙、餐叉或餐刀，因此，功能什么也没有解释。对此我们只需指出，对科学的思想家来说，解释只不过是对个复杂事实的最恰当描述。,"When an anti-functionalist remonstrates that, after all, there are cultures where neither spoons nor forks nor knives are used, and that, therefore, function explains nothing, we simply have to point out that explanation to the scientific thinker is nothing else but the most adequate description of a complex fact."
9954,针对功能论的这种批评派生于对于前科学第一因或“真正原因”的渴求，这使它根本不能证明为什么一种特殊形式的鼓或喇叭、餐具或神学概念在一个文化中的流行。,"The type of criticism levelled against functionalism, to the effect that it never can prove why a specific form of drum or trumpet, of table implement or theological concept, is prevalent in a culture, derives from the prescientific craving for first causes or ""true causes."""
9954,在对“起源”和“历史原因”的持续搜求中，即在无文献、无记载的朦胧王国中对既无历史又未留下任何先前进化痕迹的民族的历史过去和进化开端的搜索中，这些弊端更为显而易见。,"These can be more readily seen in the persistent search for ""origins"" and ""historic causes,"" in the nebulous realms of the undocumented, unrecorded historic past or evolutionary beginnings of a people who neither have a history nor have left any traces of their previous evolution."
9955,举一个身边的例子，关于主要的功能解释是否必须考虑“社会密度”（social density)、群体团结及其整合、欣快与沮丧等现象，这在功能学派内部也存在争议。,"Within the functional school, to take an example nearer home, there is dispute as to whether the principal functional explanation must revolve about the fact of ""social density,"" the solidarity of the group, its integration, and such phenomena as euphoria and disphoria, which are held to be unidentifiable by one branch of functionalists and real by the other."
9955,某些功能论者认为这都不可识別，其他人则认为这是真实存在。,
9955,尽管多数人类学家认为家庭至少是现实中的一个真实单元，它可以识别并遍布于整个人类，是所有文化中的一个普同现象。但仍有为数不少的人类学家否认这个文化形貌（configuration)或制度的确定性。,"Whereas most anthropologists agree that the family, at least, is a real isolate of cultural reality that can be identified and traced throughout humanity, and is a universal of all culture, there are still not a few anthropologists who dispute the identity of this cultural configuration or institution."
9956,因此，宪纲的形成和规范的程序化都意味着文化中的象征角色的全部理解。这一点我们很快还会转回来讲。,"Hence, the formulation of the charter, as well as the codification of norms, implies a full understanding of the role of symbolism in culture, a point to which we will soon have to turn."
9956,至于功能，我们已将其定义为需求的满足。,"As regards function, we have defined it as the satisfaction of needs."
9956,至此，我们只是全面分析了生物或基本的需求，也间接指出了衍生、次生、功用性驱力或文化需求的不可避免性。,"So far we have only fully analyzed the biological or basic needs, and indicated the inevitability of the derived, secondary or instrumental imperatives or cultural needs."
9956,然而很显然，这个概念指的不过是科学分析的类型，人类行为的另一种类型，尤其是当我们把它应用于一个完整的制度时。,"It is clear, however, that this concept refers rather to the type of scientific analysis, the other type to human behavior, especially when we apply it to an institution as a whole."
9957,这种进程的一个方面是，艺术日益与经济相结合，这既是因为通过扩大艺术在广告中所起的作用而被用来鼓励人们消费，也是因为艺术本身变成了一种商品。,"Another aspect of this process is that art becomes increasingly integrated into the economy because it is used to encourage people to consume through the expanded role it plays in advertising, and because it becomes a commercial good in its own right."
9957,另一个方面是，后现代通俗文化拒绝尊重艺术的权利和特色。,"Also, postmodern popular culture refuses to respect the pretensions and distinctiveness of art."
9957,"因此，艺术与通俗文化之间差别的崩溃,以及二者之间的交叉，己变得越发普遍。","Therefore, the breakdown of the distinction between art and popular culture, as well as crossovers between the two, become more prevalent."
9958,这种事情是“决然”不会发生的，因此李维斯牛仔裤也就“决然”不可能利用果酱乐队的歌来为自己促销。然而，没有“决然”。,"As this was not going to happen, Levi jeans would never use a song by The Jam to sell its products."
9958,事实是，与果酱乐队具有同样政治信念的撞击乐队早已开始用自己的歌来为牛仔裤的销售服务。,"But this had already happened to The Clash, a band with equally sound political credentials."
9958,原有的循环转变戛然而止了，而文化研究即将用“霸权”的概念来为进一步的讨论提供理论支撑（参见第四章）。,"This circular exchange stalled to a stop.The cultural studies use of the concept of hegemony would have, at the very least, fuelled further discussion (see Chapter 4)."
9959,微观政治与宏观政治之间的关系是多样而散乱的。,The relationships between micropolitics and macropolitics are diverse and dispersed.
9959,最微观的微观政治是幻想的内在世界（见《解读大众》，第5b章）。,"The most micro of micropolitics is the interior world of fantasy (see Reading the Popular, Chapter 5b)."
9959,将幻 想保留在内在空间，处于意识形态的殖民势力范围之外，具有想 像自己在不同的环境中有不同行为的能力，等等，这些并不一定导致无论是在微观或宏观层面上的社会行动，但却构成诸如此类行动的基础。,"The preservation of fantasy as an interior place beyond the reach of ideological colonization, and the ability to imagine oneself acting differently in different circumstances, may not in itself result in social action, whether at the micro or macro level, but it does constitute the ground upon which any such action must occur."
9960,“话语”这个概念在后马克思主义的发展过程中扮演了中心角色。,The concept of discourse is central to the development of post-Marxism.
9960,"诚如拉克劳所言：“这一论断的基本假设是，很有可能人们的一切感知、思维和行动都依赖于某一特定的意义领域的结构化形成, 而这一领域先于一切即刻事实存在。”","As Laclau explains, ""The basic hypothesis of a discursive approach is that the very possibility of perception, thought and action depends on the structuration of a certain meaningful field which preexists any factual immediacy""."
9961,由于1866—1867年英国发生了关于投票权的政治动乱，于是才有了阿诺德的这番言论。,The context of all this is the suffrage agitation of 1866–7.
9961,引文中的“令我们困惑”一句清晰地表明了其话语的阶级属性。,Arnold’s employment of the phrase ‘beginning to perplex us’ is a clear indication of the class nature of his discourse.
9961,阿诺德曾将英国人划分为野蛮人（Barbarians，指代贵族）、非利士指代中产阶级和群氓（Populace，指代工人阶级），表面上看似乎不偏不倚；还似乎就像阿诺德本人声称的那样，“无论哪个阶级的人，都有一种共同的人性基础”（同上）。,"His division of society into Barbarians (aristocracy), Philistines (middle class) and Populace (working class) would seem at first sight to defuse the class nature of this discourse.This seems to be supported by his claim that under all ‘our class divisions, there is a common basis of human nature’ (ibid.)."
9962,与“戏仿”一样，“混仿”也是对某种独特假面或某种僵化语言的模拟，不过这种模拟是一种中立的实践，并不似“戏仿”一般基于某种隐秘的动机。“混仿”既无讽刺挖苦之意，更无诱人发笑之功；它认为人们偶然说出的反常言语中并不隐含着任何既定的惯例，而某些正常的语言规范依旧存在。,"Pastiche is, like parody, the imitation of a peculiar mask, speech in a dead language: but it is a neutral practice of such mimicry, without any of parody's ulterior motives, amputated of the satiric impulse, devoid of laughter and of any conviction that alongside the abnormal tongue you have momentarily borrowed, some healthy linguistic normality still exists."
9962,故而，“混仿”乃是一种空白的戏仿。,Pastiche is thus blank parody
9963,虽然对意识形态的这种看法与《德意志意识形态》所提出的看法之间存在着明显的差别，但默多克和戈尔丁仍然把它并入了他们有关大众媒介的政治经济学的概念之中。,"Despite differences between this perspective on ideology and that offered in The German Ideology, Murdock and Golding incorporate it into their conception of a political economy of the mass media."
9963,既然马克思作出的这种陈述是对市民社会的政治经济学的一种概括，那么就可以用它来概括现代媒介。,"Since Marx offers this statement as an outline of a political economy of civil society, it can be taken to include the modern media."
9963,因而，默多克和戈尔丁把马克思关于占统治地位的观念与意识形态的基础—上层建筑模式结合起来时，没有遇到任何困难。,Murdock and Golding combine Marx's ruling ideas and base—superstructure models of ideology.
9964,贝洛克认为这种社会从两个方面崩溃:一方面是国家采取福利行动(纯粹的资本主义无法体现的行动）；另一方面是垄断并限制交易。,Belloc sees it breaking down in two ways: on the one hand into State action for welfare (which pure capitalism cannot embody); on the other hand into monopoly and the restraint of trade.
9964,资本主义制度既然崩溃，只有两条路可供选择:社会主义——贝洛克称之为集体主义；以及大规模重新分配财产——贝洛克称之为分产主义。,"There are only two alternatives to this system: socialism, which Belloc calls collectivism; and the redistribution of property on a significant scale, which Belloc calls distributivism."
9964,如果把我们的社会困境视为工业革命的产物，那就不能了解这种困境，因为现代社会并不是由于工业的发展而形成的事实上英囯在工业制度以前就有资本主义。,"Our social difficulties will not be understood if they are regarded as the product of the Industrial Revolution: modern society was not formed by the growth of industry, but by the fact that capitalism was here in England before the Industrial System..."
9964,……在一连串重大发现之前，工业制度的策源地英国，就已经被一种有钱人的寡头政治所控制。,"England, the seed-plot of the Industrial System, was already captured by a wealthy oligarchy before the series of great discoveries began."
9965,建筑中的后现代主义拒绝这种元叙事。,Postmodernism in architecture rejects this metanarrative.
9965,它的标志是装饰极其华美的、精心设计的、语境化的和色彩明快的建筑，突出虚构性和嬉笑顽皮，用几乎任意的和折中的方式，混合了从不同历史时期吸取来的各种风格。,"Its hallmarks are: highly ornate, elaborately designed, contextualised and brightly coloured buildings; a stress on fictionality and playfulness; and the mixing of styles drawn from different historical periods in almost random and eclectic designs."
9965,后现代主义把建筑变成了对风格和外表的赞颂，用建筑来对已建成的空间幵玩笑。,"Postmodernism turns buildings into celebrations of style and surface, using architecture to make jokes about built space."
9966,根据阿尔都塞的看法，经济决定论并不是一个可以从经验上来解决的问题，尽管他提到了社会的物质史和阶级斗争。,"According to Althusser, economic determinism is not a problem which can be resolved empirically, despite his references to the material history of societies and to the class struggle."
9966,真正科学的解决办法必定是理论上的。,Real scientific solutions must be theoretical.
9966,阿尔都塞承认马克思主义理论可以相应地被解释为经济决定论的，但坚持认为经济决定论仅仅在“最终”起作用。,"Althusser knows that Marxism was and is a theory of economic determinism.However, he insists that, scientifically speaking, economic determinism works only in ""the last instance""."
9967,在1880年到1990年间，在人类学方面，社会科学已经开始开掘出通向决定论哲学的道路。泰勒说：“如果某个领域中有其规律，那么，全部领域就都有其规律。”,"Social science had won its way to the philosophy of determinism in the anthropology of the 1880's and '90's: ""If law is anywhere it is everywhere."" said Tylor."
9968,霸权的“均势妥协”还可被用来分析大众文化内部及大众文化所折射出的其他类型的冲突。,The compromise equilibrium of hegemony can also be employed to analyse different types of conflict within and across popular culture.
9968,本内特强调的是阶级冲突，除此之外，族裔、“种族”、性别、代际、性征、身体缺陷等范畴内的冲突也同样适用，因为所有这些冲突都在不同的情况下参与到了旨在对抗主流或宰制性力量之收编的文化斗争之中。,"Bennett highlights class conflict, but hegemony theory can also be used to explore and explain conflicts involving ethnicity, ‘race’, gender, generation, sexuality, disability, etc.– all are at different moments engaged in forms of cultural struggle against the homogenizing forces of incorporation of the official or dominant culture."
9968,在对霸权理论的应用中，尤其是在后马克思主义的文化研究范式中（参见第四章），最关键的概念是“接合”①(articulation;此处本词同时表达了两层意思，一是“表达自己的观点”，二是“与对方建立临时的关联”）。,"The key concept in this use of hegemony theory, especially in post-Marxist cultural studies (see Chapter 4), is the concept of ‘articulation’ (the word being employed in its double sense to mean both to express and to make a temporary connection)."
9969,最近，史密斯教授和佩利先生提出文化源于埃及并向世界传播的学说。这是本应该归入其他被拋弃的假说之列，或者是否属于对文化史的持久贡献，还有待观察。,Whether the doctrines recently propounded by Prof. Elliot Smith and Mr. Perry about the universal spread of culture from Egypt will have to be classed with other discarded hypotheses or whether they contain a permanent contribution to the history of culture remains to be seen.
9969,他们对人类学资料的利用不能令人满意，而且他们的争论实属考古学范畴，而他们在那里已经遇到反对的批判。,"Their use of anthropological data is unsatisfactory and their argument really belongs to archaeology, in which field their views have met with adverse criticism."
9970,"由是，二人宣称：“酷儿理论并非仅仅""关于""同性恋者，正如女性研究也并非仅仅""关于""女人一样。事实上，酷儿理论所要攻击的乃是……性别之分的""理所当然性""，及其所竭力维护的异性恋霸权。“","In this way, they contend, ""Queer Theory is no more “about” lesbians and gay men than women's studies is “about” women. Indeed, part of the project of Queer is to attack . . . the very “naturalness” of gender and, by extension, the fictions supporting compulsory heterosexuality""."
9971,利维斯主义的基本立场是：“文化始终是少数人的专利。”纵观历史，我们不难发现，社会因少数人的杰出经验而获益；是他们让传统中的那些细微而易碎的部分保持生机。衡量一个时代的生活优质与否的潜在的标准，也要依托于少数人。,Leavisism is based on the assumption that‘culture has always been in minority keeping’:Upon the minority depends our power of profiting by the finest human experience of the past; they keep alive the subtlest and most perishable parts of tradition.
9971,正因有了他们，我们才知道何物有价值、何路通彼岸、何处是中心。,"Upon them depend the implicit standards that order the finer living of an age, the sense that this is worth more than that, this rather than that is the direction in which to go, that the centre is here rather than there."
9972,利益论的基本观点众所周知，毋需多讲。这些基本观点已被马克思主义传统发展到完善的地步，是普通人标准的知识装备。他们对政治争论很明白：输贏已定。,"The fundamentals of the interest theory are too well known to need review; developed to perfection of a sort by the Marxist tradition, they are now standard intellectual equipment of the man-in-the-street, who is only too aware that in political argumentation it all comes down to whose ox is gored."
9973,其实，《心灵的任务》四章由的每一章，虽然确有启发性和激励性，都以一个问号结尾。,"As it is, every one of the four chapters of Psyche's Task, suggestive and stimulating as it is, ends on a questionmark."
9973,在讨论过巫术对政府的贡献之后，我们被告知“许多人怀着迷信的畏惧，将其统治者——酋长或国 王——视为超人并拥有天赋的、大于凡人的力量。,"After discussing the contributions of magic to government, we are told ""that many peoples have regarded their rulers, whether chiefs or kings, with superstitious awe as beings of a higher order and endowed with mightier powers than common folk."""
9973,”这里正如我们指出的，弗雷泽自己的证据表明，作为秩序和规则支柱的权威，在家户、领地群体和部落中都不可或缺。,"Here Frazer's own evidence shows, as we have indicated, that authority, as the backbone of order and regulation, is indispensable in household, municipality, and tribe."
9973,原始人对自己酋长的敬畏是一种信念的副产品：即领导者凭其能力、专门知识和灵力或德行来作首领,"The superstitious awe and respect given by the primitives to their chiefs is the byproduct of the conviction that the leader leads in virtue of his power, his expert knowledge, and his mana or sanctity."
9974,这使得马克思主义呈现出一种独特的政治性。,This makes Marxist analysis political in a quite specific way.
9974,当然，这并不意味着其他理论体系和研究方法就与政治绝缘；只不过，马克思主义强调世间万物归根结蒂都是政治的。,"But this is not to suggest that other methods and approaches are apolitical; on the contrary, Marxism insists that all are ultimately political."
9974,正如美国马克思主义文化批评家弗雷德里克•詹明信 (Fredric Jameson)所言：“政治的视角乃是一切阅读和解释行为的地平线。”（ Jameson，1981: 17),"As the American Marxist cultural critic Fredric Jameson (1981) puts it, ‘the political perspective [is] the absolute horizon of all reading and all interpretation’ (17)."
9975,很多19世纪的文化批评家都关心美国化问题，因为他们把它等同于大众民主的平民主义，因而担心它会让大众管理政府，降低文化标准。,"Many nineteenth-century cultural critics were concerned about Americanisation because they identified it with mass democratic populism, and thus feared it would allow the masses to run the government and lower cultural standards."
9975,不过，另一些人则把美国与民主、现代性、合理性和科学联系起来。,"Others, however, associated America with democracy, modernity, rationality and science."
9975,例如，科学家T.H.赫胥黎认为，美国代表着科学的、合理的未来的前途。,"The scientist T.H.Huxley, for example, saw America as representing the promise of a scientific and rational future."
9976,诸多问题都是由于他者的缺席引起的。不管使用何种释义，这总让我们觉得棘手。,A great deal of the difficulty arises from the absent other which always haunts any definition we might use.
9976,大众文化是一个说不完、道不尽的话题，而我们总是在对比之中来理解大众文化。,It is never enough to speak of popular culture; we have always to acknowledge that with which it is being contrasted.
9976,无论与大众文化相对的“他者”是什么——是群氓文化、高雅文化，还是工人阶级文化、民间文化，等等——概念本身都会因之而发生理论或政治意义上的变化。,"And whichever of popular culture’s others we employ, mass culture, high culture, working-class culture, folk culture, etc., it will carry into the definition of popular culture a specific theoretical and political inflection."
9976,"正如本内特所指出的：“对此问题，绝无‘万无一失’ 的解决方法;却有一系列互不相同的解决途径，每一种途径都会带来不同的释义、产生不同的影响。""（Bennett, 1982a: 87)本书的主要意图在于：在文化理论与大众文化之错综复杂的关系中，为各种各样的问题及其纷繁的解决路径绘制一个学科地图。","‘There is’, as Bennett (1982a) indicates, ‘no single or “correct” way of resolving these problems; only a series of different solutions which have different implications and effects’ (86).The main purpose of this book is to chart the many problems encountered, and the many solutions suggested, in cultural theory’s complex engagement with popular culture."
9977,再以政府问题和政治强力在一个相对于文化组织的社区（community）内部的运用问题为例。,Take the problems of government and the use of political force within a community as opposed to cultural organization.
9977,这是一个国家相对于民族的问题。,This is the problem of the state versus the nation.
9977,人类学分析能为我们更全面地理解相对于公民身份的所谓民族性——过去一个半世纪的人类历史证明，它是民族主义(nationalism)的本质要素——提供一个背景。,"A full understanding of what we mean by nation-ality as opposed to citizenship, which is the essence of nationalism as it has appeared during the last century and a half in human history, can also be supplied by a background of anthropological analysis."
9977,这种分析能揭示出：在进化中，民族感(nationhood)是一条比政治制度、部落国家和帝国之类政治组织更古老和更基本的原理。,"This would reveal that nationhood is a much older and more fundamental principle in evolution than the political organization of a police system, a tribe-state, or an empire."
9977,这也表明，我们现代民族的文化自治，可以通过限制政治主权——特别是国家在军事方面的自决权——面得到丰富和复兴。,"This would also show that the cultural autonomy of our modern nations would be enriched and revitalized by the limitation of political sovereignty, especially as regards the military self-determination of the state."
9978,文化与权力的关系是后马克思主义文化研究所关注的首要议题。,Culture and power is the primary object of study in post-Marxist cultural studies.
9978,霍尔解释道意义（也就是文化）……控制和组织着我们的行为和实践；它设定了规则、标准与惯例，而社会生活也因意义的存在而井井有条。,"As Hall explains, ‘Meanings [i.e.cultures] . . . regulate and organize our conduct and practices--they help to set the rules, norms and conventions by which social life is ordered and governed."
9978,于是，意义就成了那些想要操纵他人行为和思想的人竭尽全力抢占的‘必争之地”。,"They are . . . , therefore, what those who wish to govern and regulate the conduct and ideas of others seek to structure and shape’."
9978,意义是一种“物质的”存在，正因如此它才能够指导实践；此外，从前文提到的“男性气质”和“在中国递名片”的例子中我们也可以看到，正是意义为人们的日常行为设立了规范。,"Meanings have a ‘material’ existence, in that they help organize practice; they establish norms of behaviour, as we recognized in the examples of different masculinities and the passing of a business card in China."
9979,例如，英国保守党在1990年制作播出了一期政治宣传节目，节目结束时的最后一个词是“社会主义”，而此时电视上出现了红色监狱栅栏的影像，这就暗示其竞争对手工党所鼓吹的社会主义无异于建造了社会、经济与政治的囹圄。,"For example, a Conservative Party political broadcast transmitted in 1990 ended with the word ‘socialism’ being transposed into red prison bars.What was being suggested is that the socialism of the Labour Party is synonymous with social, economic and political imprisonment."
9979,这期节目就是要达到为“社会主义”一词赋予内涵的目的。,The broadcast was attempting to fix the connotations of the word ‘socialism’.
9979,此外，此举还旨在将对手置于某种二元对立关系——社会主义意味着囚禁，而保守主义倡导自由——之中。,"Moreover, it hoped to locate socialism in a binary relationship in which it connoted unfreedom, whilst conservatism connoted freedom."
9979,"在巴尔特看来，这期节目是意识形态操控的经典案例，电视文本试图将原本具有特殊性的事物普世化、合法化,让观众误将文化之物（人类创造的）当作自然之物（先天存在的）。","For Barthes, this would be a classic example of the operations of ideology, the attempt to make universal and legitimate what is in fact partial and particular; an attempt to pass off that which is cultural (i.e.humanly made) as something which is natural (i.e."
9979,,just existing).
9980,巴尔特指出，为人们所消费的神话是在次级指意系统或内涵的层面上被生产出来的。,He claims that it is at the level of secondary signification or connotation that myth is produced for consumption.
9980,在他看来，神话就是包含了一整套观念与实践的意识形态，其功能在于积极推行统治阶级的利益与价值观，维护既存的社会权力结构。,"By myth he means ideology understood as a body of ideas and practices, which by actively promoting the values and interests of dominant groups in society, defend the prevailing structures of power."
9980,若想深入理解巴尔特的上述观点，需首先认清符号的多义性特征，意即，一个符号具有指向多重意义的潜能。,"To understand this aspect of his argument, we need to understand the polysemic nature of signs, that is, that they have the potential to signify multiple meanings."
9981,然而，符号学的任务是要超越这些外延，达到符号的内涵。,But the task of semiology is to go beyond these denotations to get to the connotations of the sign.
9981,这么做揭示了神话如何通过特定的各种符号起作用。在这个方面，可以发现神话建构的、虚构的和历史的定位。,"Doing this reveals how myth works through particular signs, and shows how the constructed, manufactured and historical location of the myth can be discovered."
9981,因时，神话的种种内涵可以得到确认：这看起来是一束玫瑰花，但它表示激情；这看起来是一幅黑人士兵向法国国旗敬礼的照片，但它的确表示了法帝主义的伟大和公正。,"The connotations of myths can thus be identified: this may appear to be a bunch of roses but it connotes passion; or this may appear to be a photo of a black soldier saluting the French flag, but it really connotes the grandeur and impartiality of French imperialism."
9982,在英国，种族主义最早是为维护奴隶制与奴隶贸易的合法性而出现的。,Racism first develops in England as a defence of slavery and the slave trade.
9982,彼得•弗莱尔指出：“当英国的奴隶贸易、英国的种植园奴隶制和英国的制造业三者开始联手追逐髙额利润，那些古老的神话碎片与人种偏见便有了强悍的经济基础，逐渐转化为一套牢固的种族主义意识形态，也就是一系列关于种族的神话。,"As Peter Fryer points out, ""Once the English slave trade, English sugar-producing plantation slavery, and English manufacturing industry had begun to operate as a trebly profitable interlocking system, the economic basis had been laid for all those ancient scraps of myth and prejudice to be woven into a more or less coherent racist ideology: a mythology of race""."
9982,”换言之，种族主义起初是一种防御性意识形态，其传播意图在于维护奴隶制与奴隶贸易所带来的经济利益。,"In other words, racism first emerges as a defensive ideology, promulgated in order to defend the economic profits of slavery and the slave trade."
9983,毫无疑问，若无肇始于20世纪70年代早期的第二波女性主义浪潮，肖沃特决计说不出此番话来。,There can be no doubt that without the emergence of feminism (the second wave) in the early 1970s this sentence could not have been written.
9983,性别问题得以添列学术议程，皆系女性主义之功。,It is feminism that has placed gender on the academic agenda.
9983,不过，种种议题的特质亦于女性主义内部引发了激烈争论。,"However, the nature of the agenda has provoked a vigorous debate within feminism itself."
9983,由是，女性主义作为一个研究、写作和行为的整体性思潮如今已不复存在，而是发生了分裂并产生了若干变种。今日我们所要讨论的，与其说是单数的女性主义，不如说是复数的女性诸主义。,"So much so that it is really no longer possible, if it ever was, to talk of feminism as a monolithic body of research, writing and activity; one should really speak of feminisms."
9984,在下一部分，我将讨论浅白是对“有深度的” 真理的拒绝。归根到底，真理是一种控制性的话语，而浅白并不 提供有洞见卓识的解释，而是让它本身悬而未决。,"In the next section I argue that the obvious refuses the ""in-depth"" truth, which is finally a controlling discourse—the obvious offers no insightful explanation, and leaves itself open."
9984,不过，浅白不仅是指文本处理的事物是浅露的，而且其处理方式本身也具有浅露的特征。浅白与陈词滥调是同一件事物的两面。,"But obviousness is not just a characteristic of what is dealt with, it lies also in the way it is handled—the obvious and the cliched are two sides of the same coin."
9985,人类婴儿需要父母保护的时间比最髙等的类人猿还要长。,The human infant needs parental protection for a much longer period than does the young of even the highest anthropoid apes.
9985,因此，如任何文化中的生殖，即交媾、怀孕和生产的行为，如果不与基于法律的亲子关系的事实相联系就不能延续。这种亲子关系规定父母必然照顾孩子很长一段时间，并应该由于付出照顾和心血而获得某些益处。,"Hence, no culture could endure in which the act of reproduction, that is, mating, pregnancy, and childbirth, was not linked up with the fact of legally-founded parenthood, that is, a relationship in which the father and the mother have to look after the children for a long period, and, in turn, derive certain benefits for the care and trouble taken."
9985,我们已经讨论过长期的生殖循环相对应的种种制度。,We have already discussed the various institutions corresponding to the long-drawn-out reproductive cycle.
9986,我就认识一个像JR那样的讨厌鬼，尽管他只是个普通的建筑工人而已。,"In real life I know a horror like JR, but he’s just an ordinary builder’ (43)."
9986,”（43)正因电视观众有能力将自己的日常生活与屏幕上那个德州豪门联系起来，我们才可言称《豪》剧体现了“情感现实主义”。,It is this ability to make our own lives connect with the lives of a family of Texan millionaires that gives the programme its emotional realism.
9986,也许我们并不是有钱人，但我们和剧中的富家子弟之间存在着共通之处:悲欢离合，生老病死，诸如此类。,"We may not be rich, but we may have other fundamental things in common: relationships and broken relationships, happiness and sadness, illness and health."
9986,那些认为该剧现实的观众，将注意力从叙事的独特性（“外延”）上移开，转而关心剧情主题的普遍性（“内涵”）。,Those who find it realisict shift the focus of attention from the particularity of the narrative (‘denotation’) to the generality of its themes (‘connotation’).
9987,政治组织和它的防御、侵略或大型部落集会之类的活动，当然都要求有饮食、居住和气候等某种形式的保护。,"Political organization and such of its activities as defence, aggression, or large tribal gatherings, demand of course some form of feeding, housing, and climate protection."
9987,因此，无论考察的是氏族、年龄级，还是军事力童或一个部落的议事会，我们都必须确定需求和驱力的整个范围。在成功的操作过程中它们必须得到满足。,"Hence, whether we consider the clan, the age-grade, or the military force or deliberative council of a tribe, we would have to determine the whole range of needs and imperatives which have to be satisfied in the course of a successful performance."
9987,即使转而考虑最高级文化中的高度成形的制度，即以职业分工为基础的制度，我们也会发现它们很少能以一个简单和特定的功能来定义。,"Even if we turned to very highly crystallized institutions on the highest level of culture, that is, institutions on the occupational basis, we would find that they seldom can be defined in terms of a simple and specific function."
9987,银行系统显然是首先关心提供信贷和进行投资以及企业的资本化。,The banking system is obviously concerned primarily with the supply of credit and the handling of investments and the capitalization of enterprise.
9988,围绕着各种差异轴（譬如阶级、性别、种族、年龄等等）所组成的一种复杂的基质，社会得以结构成形，其中每一个差异轴都有一个权力向度。,"Society is structured around a complex matrix of axes of difference (class, gender, race, age, and so on), each of which has a dimension of power."
9988,如果没有权力差异，就没有社会差异。所以，正如霍尔所言，界定“大众”的方式之一，便是通过它与“权力集团”的对抗性来识别它。,"There is no social difference without power difference, so one way of defining the popular is, as Hall does, to identify it by its oppositionality to “the power-bloc."
9988,,""""
9989,诸多问题都是由于他者的缺席引起的。不管使用何种释义，这总让我们觉得棘手。,A great deal of the difficulty arises from the absent other which always haunts any definition we might use.
9989,大众文化是一个说不完、道不尽的话题，而我们总是在对比之中来理解大众文化。,It is never enough to speak of popular culture; we have always to acknowledge that with which it is being contrasted.
9989,无论与大众文化相对的“他者”是什么——是群氓文化、高雅文化，还是工人阶级文化、民间文化，等等——概念本身都会因之而发生理论或政治意义上的变化。,"And whichever of popular culture’s others we employ, mass culture, high culture, working-class culture, folk culture, etc., it will carry into the definition of popular culture a specific theoretical and political inflection."
9989,"正如本内特所指出的：“对此问题，绝无‘万无一失’ 的解决方法;却有一系列互不相同的解决途径，每一种途径都会带来不同的释义、产生不同的影响。""（Bennett, 1982a: 86)本书的主要意图在于：在文化理论与大众文化之错综复杂的关系中，为各种各样的问题及其纷繁的解决路径绘制一个学科地图。","‘There is’, as Bennett (1982a) indicates, ‘no single or “correct” way of resolving these problems; only a series of different solutions which have different implications and effects’ (86).The main purpose of this book is to chart the many problems encountered, and the many solutions suggested, in cultural theory’s complex engagement with popular culture."
9990,驱力的概念最好从人类行为分析里略去，除非我们明白我们对它的用法必须与动物心理学或生理学不同。由于概念的差异最好能用术语的差异来区分，所以我就用动机来代表在特定文化里确实存在的欲求。,"The concept of drive is better omitted from any analysis of human behavior,unless, that is, we understand that we have to use it differently from the animal psychologists or physiologists.Since a conceptual differentiation is always best terminologically differentiated, we shall speak henceforth of motive, meaning by this the urge as it actually is found in operation within a given culture."
9990,此外，我们必须重新界定生理学最低限度的概念，即生理动机能够从中得到调整但又不至于迫使一个文化里的文化成员机体退化或人口枯竭。,"We have, however, to reformulate our concept of that physiological minimum, the limits within which physiological motivations can be refashioned so that they still do not force organic degeneration or depopulation upon the members of a culture."
9990,因此，相对于动机时，我们使用需求。,"As opposed to motive, therefore, we speak of needs."
9991,"人类学，作为广义的人的科学，作为人文研究中最宽泛的“无论所""学科，是一位姗姗来迟者。","Anthropology, as the science of man at large, as the most comprehensive discipline in humanism without portfolio, was the last to come."
9991,因此，它必须得在范围、对象、方法等方面见缝插针，挤出空间。,"It had to peg out its claims as to scope, subject matter, and method as best it could."
9991,它搜罗别人的剩余，甚至要悄然挤占老学科的一些领地。,"It absorbed what was left over, and even had to encroach on some older preserves."
9991,它现在的研究包括史前史、民俗学、体质人类学和文化人类学这使它危险地接近其他社会和自然科学，如心理学、历史学、考古学、社会学和解剖学的合法研究领域。,"It consists now of such studies as prehistory, folklore, physical anthropology, and cultural anthropology.These come dangerously near other legitimate fields of social and natural sciences: psychology, history, archaeology, sociology and anatomy."
9992,于是，在撰写人的研究的科学方法时，人类学家就有了一项虽不甚轻松，但颇为重要的任务。,"Thus, in writing about the scientific approach to the Study of Man, an anthropologist has a task which, though perhaps not easy, is of some importance."
9992,他有责任界定人类学现存各分支之间实际存在何种关系。,It is his duty to define in what relation to one another the various branches of anthropology really stand.
9992,他必须确定人类学在人文研究众多学科中应占据的位置，他也不得不重新讨论一个老问题，即人文学科在何种意义上才算是科学？,"He has to determine the place which anthropology ought to occupy in the wider fraternity of humanistic studies.He has also to reopen the old question, in what sense humanism can be scientific."
9993,我首先要说明，科学方法明显不是人文学科领域中惟一的关注点和灵感源泉。,I would like to state first that the scientific approach is obviously not the only interest or inspiration in the domain of humanism.
9993,道德或哲学的观点；美学的、人道的或神学的热忱或灵感；因过去以一种既无需证实又无法否认，而使人神往，产生要知其为何物的欲望——这些都是所有人文学科的合法动机，如此等等。,"Moral or philosophical points of view; aesthetic, humanitarian, or theological zeal or inspiration; the desire to know what the past was because the past appeals to our sentiments in a manner which need not be vindicated but cannot be gainsaid— all these are legitimate motivations in all humanities."
9993,但科学至少作为一种工具，一种达到目的的手段，还是必不可少的。,"Science, however, as a tool at least, as a means to an end, is indispensable."
9994,因此，我们所讲的人性，就是指内在于每个文明及其中所有个体的生物决定因素，即执行诸如呼吸、睡觉、休息、营养、排泄和生殖等躯体功能。,"By human nature, therefore, we mean the biological determinism which imposes on every civilization and on all individuals in it: the carrying out of such bodily functions as breathing, sleep, rest, nutrition, excretion, and reproduction."
9994,我们可以将基本需求定义为群体和个体为了生存而必须满足的环境和生物条件。,We can define the concept of basic needs as the environmental and biological conditions which must be fulfilled for the survival of the individual and the group.
9994,事实上，两者的生存都要求维持以保持为文化表演所必须的起码健康和活力，并保持为防止人口逐渐减少所必需的最低数量。,"Indeed, the survival of both requires the maintenance of a minimum of health and vital energy necessary for the performance of cultural tasks, and for the minimum numbers necessary for the prevention of gradual depopulation."
9995,如本书中讨论过的大多数大众文化形式一样，融合文化也是一个斗争与协商的场所。,"Convergence culture, like most popular culture discussed in this book, is a site of struggle and negotiation."
9995,我们不可将其孤立地理解为自上而下的强加的文化或自下而上的自发的文化，而需始终视其为两股力量之间复杂的冲突性共融的产物。,"It cannot be explained and understood as something imposed from ‘above’ or as something spontaneously emerging from ‘below’, but as a complex and contradictory combination of both forces."
9995,诚如亨利詹金斯所言：融合……既是一个自上而下的商业驱动过程，又是一个自下而上的消费驱动过程，是商业融合与草根融合的共存体。,"As Jenkins observes, Convergence...is both a top--down corporate-driven process and a bottom--up consumer-driven process."
9996,此外别无犯罪。,There are no other crimes.
9996,偷窃很少发生，而且属于私事。,Theft rarely occurs and is a private matter.
9996,通奸不箅犯罪，由此引起的紧张可通过他们的婚姻安排得到顺利解决，杀人也可通过双方家庭之间的赔偿而迅速得到处理。,"Adultery is no crime and the strain that arises from such an act is easily taken care of under their marriage arrangements.Homicide, in the one case that is remembered, was settled quickly by payments between the two families."
9997,霍皮人随蛇而舞并非故弄危险和制造恐怖，在我们的文明中，对蛇有着一种普遍的恐惧，以致造成我们对蛇舞的误解。,Nor is the dancing with snakes a courting of the dangerous and the terrible in Hopi.There is current in our civilization so common a horror of snakes that we misread the Snake Dance.
9997,我们会轻而易举地将在类似情形下感受到的情绪归罪于跳舞人。,We readily attribute to the dancers the emotions we should feel in like case.
9997,但美洲印第安人并不常把蛇与恐惧相联系。,But snakes are not often regarded with horror by the American Indians.
9998,但是，就这个事实而言，多布中的无政府状态可以说是无与伦比了。他们以同心圆形式构成社会组织，每一组织内部，允许存在特殊的传统敌意形式。,"Nothing could be further from the truth, however, than to see in Dobu a state of anarchy.Dobuan social organization is arranged in concentric circles, within each of which specified traditional forms of hostility are allowed."
9998,除开在相应的特殊团体之内贯彻这些文化上认可的敌意外，任何人都不操握法律。,No man takes the law into his own hands except to carry out these culturally allowed hostilities within the appropriate specified group.
9999,男性会社，即各种秘密社团、俱乐部、未婚男子会所以及类似的团体，都能包括进制度的概念而毫无困难。,"Male associations, that is, secret societies, clubs, bachelors' houses, and such like, can be included in the concept of institutions without difficulty."
9999,我要提醒你们的是，每种这样的分群也有其法律的和神话的宪纲，而这又意味着其人事及其行为规范的定义，它们每个都有一种物质体现、一个聚会地点、一些财产以及一些特定仪式和功用性的器物。,"Let me remind you that each such grouping has also its legal and mythological charter, and that this implies a definition of its personnel and its norms of behavior, and that each of them has a material embodiment, a place of reunion, some wealth, and some specific ritual and instrumental apparatus."
9999,大多制度都能被包括在个更宽泛的类别里，我们可以称其为职业或专业类别。,"A large group of institutions can be included in a wide class, which we might label occupational or professional."
9999,文化的各个方面，即教育、经济、法律的管理、巫术表演和宗教崇拜等各类行为，可能会也可能不会在具体的制度中得到体现。,"The various aspects of culture, that is, the various types of activity such as education, economics, the administration of law, magical performance and religious worship, may or may not be embodied in specific institutions."
10000,,They pay much closer attention to behaving competently and they allow themselves fewer alibis than Amer- icans.
10000,他们远比美国人更加注意力能胜任的行为，而不为自己找借口，也不象我们那样经常把生活的不满归咎于别人。他们也不会由于没有得到美国人所谓的平均幸福（average happiness）而常常沉湎于自怜。,"They do not so often project their dissatisfactions with life upon scapegoats, and they do not so often indulge in self-pity because they have somehow or other not got what Americans call average happiness."
10000,他们已被训练得比美国人更加注意自己“身上的锈”。,They have been trained to pay much closer attention to the 'rust of the body' than is common among Americans.
10001,全部数学概念都绝没有脱离了人类物种的存在和有效性。用爱因斯言表述物理学基本原则和概念的短语来说，它们乃是“人类理智的自由创造。”,"Far from having an existence and a validity apart from the human species, all mathematical concepts are ""free inventions of the human intellect,"" to use a phrase with which Einstein characterizes the concepts and fundamental principles of physics."
10002,在近年的劳工意识形态中，塔夫脱‑哈特莱法案一直是“奴隶劳工法”。,"In recent labor ideology the Taft-Hartley Act has been a ""slave labor act ."""
10002,公正地说，这个法案不配这个标签。,By no dispassionate exami nation does the Act merit this label.
10002,对该法案任何不带偏见的评价都应分别考虑这个法的许多条款。,Any detached assessment of the Act would have to consider its many provisions individually.
10002,用任何价值准则，甚至是那些工会自己的准则，这类评价也是复杂的。,"On any set of values, even those of trade unions themselves, such an assessment would yield a mixed verdict."
10003,他们对于破解的过程本身并没有什么兴趣。,The process itself interested them less.
10003,这与《査理的天使》一片的女观众的选择行为，或者 说是偷袭战术，正好相反。《査理的天使》的女观众所选中的是 叙述过程，而不是父权制符码的显现与疑窦的解答。,"This was quite the reverse selective practice, or poaching raid, from that of the women viewers of Charlie's Angels, who watched the narrative process rather than the patriarchal posing or resolution of the enigma."
10004,在一个层面上，各神通俗文化符号的意义是自明的。,"On one level, the meaning of popular cultural signs is self-evident."
10004,它们是它们本身的样子或者它们显现的样子，一则广告，一幅黑人士兵的照片，一束玫瑰花等等。,"They are what they are or what they appear to be, an advert, a photo of a black soldier, a bunch of roses and so on."
10004,换句话说，它们向我们表示了某种东西，它们将自身向我们呈现为一个事实：这是一幅士兵的照片，一则广告，一束玫瑰花。,"They denote something to us, they present it to us as a matter of fact: this is a photo of a soldier, an advert, a bunch of roses."
10004,外延是指那些对我们显现为自然的东西和我们认为理所当然的东西。,Denotation refers to those things which appear to us as natural and which we can take for granted.
10005,强大的外样大名成了倒幕派的先锋，他们想通过“王政复古”取代德川氏而统治日本，只要求换一下当权者。,"The great Outside Lords, the daimyo of Japan's strongest fiefs who spearheaded the overthrow of the Shogunate, thought of the Restoration as a way in which they, instead of the Tokugawa, could rule Japan.They wanted a mere change of personnel."
10005,农民们盼望多保留一些自己收获的稻米，却讨厌“改革”。,The farmers wanted to keep more of the rice they raised but they hated 'reforms.'
10005,武土阶层则希望保持俸禄，并能挥刀上阵建立功勋。,The samurai wanted to keep their pensions and be allowed to use their swords for greater glory.
10005,在财政上支持王政复古派军队的商人们，希望推行重商主义，却从未指责过封建制度。,"The merchants, who financed the Restoration forces, wanted to expand mercantilism but they never arraigned the feudal system."
10006,对不同文化的研究对当今的思想、行为还具有另一种重要的影响。,The study of different cultures has another important bearing upon present-day thought and behaviour.
10006,现代生活已将许多文明置于紧密的联系之中；目前，对这种情形的最强烈的反应是民族主义和种族主义的势利眼。,"Modern existence has thrown many civilizations into close contact, and at the moment the overwhelming response to this s1tuation is nationalism and racial snobbery."
10006,从未有这样一个时代：文明更需要真正具有文化意识的人，能够客观地、毫不畏惧地、公正地理解其他民族在一定社会条件下的行为方式的人。,"There has never been a time when civilization stood more in need of individuals who are genuinely culture-conscious, who can see objectively the socially conditioned behaviour of other peoples without fear and recrimination."
10007,至于汤普森，则始终声称自己的作品是马克思主义的。,"Thompson, on the other hand, would describe his work, then and always, as Marxist."
10007,当代文化研究中心前主任理查德•约翰逊（Richard Johnson)用“文化主义”这个表述来为汤普森、霍加特和威廉斯三人的著作定性（Johnson，1979)。,"The term ‘culturalism’ was coined to describe his work, and the work of Hoggart and Williams, by one of the former directors of the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies, Richard Johnson (1979)."
10007,约翰逊认为，上述三位理论家的观点奉行一套共同的理论预设，每一个人都对前人的成果提出了一些质疑，取得了一定突破。,"Johnson uses the term to indicate the presence of a body of theoretical concerns connecting the work of the three theorists.Each, in his different way, breaks with key aspects of the tradition he inherits."
10008,阿尔都塞认为，问题域中包含了假设、动机、潜在的观念，等等；而文本（比如说一则广告）就是通过这些要素被制造出来的。,"According to Althusser a problematic consists of the assumptions, motivations, underlying ideas, etc., from which a text (say, an advert) is made."
10008,这就是说，文本是由被呈现出来的（表达出来的）东西和缺席的（未表达出来的）东西共 同结构的。,"In this way, it is argued, a text is structured as much by what is absent (what is not said) as by what is present (what is said)."
10008,因此，若想对某个文本的意义进行充分的解读，不但要发现文本中有些什么，还需弄清楚文本背后潜藏的种种假设（这些假设可能在文本之中全无任何痕迹，而仅仅存在于文本的问题域之中）。,"Althusser argues that if we are to fully understand the meaning of a text, we have to be aware of not only what is in a text but also the assumptions which inform it (and which may not appear in the text itself in any straightforward way but exist only in the text’s problematic)."
10008,只有当一个文本试图去回答自身力所不及的问题时，它的问题域才会显现出来。,One way in which a text’s problematic is supposedly revealed is in the way a text may appear to answer questions which it has not formally posed.
10008,而这些问题，也被包含在了问题域之中。,"Such questions, it is argued, have been posed in the text’s problematic."
10008,阿尔都塞试图通过批评实践来解构文本，揭示问题域；而所采取的具体方法，就是他所谓的“症候式解读” (symptomaThe Interpretation of Cultures reading) 。,The task of an Althusserian critical practice is to deconstruct the text to reveal the problematic.To do this is to perform what Althusser calls a ‘symptomatic reading’.
10009,只有当一个文本试图去回答自身力所不及的问题时，它的问题域才会显现出来。,One way in which a text's problematic is supposedly revealed is in the way a text may appear to answer questions which it has not formally posed.
10009,而这些问题，也被包含在了问题域之中。,"Such questions, it is argued, have been posed in the text's problematic."
10009,阿尔都塞试图通过批评实践来解构文本，揭示问题域；而所采取的具体方法，就是他所谓的“症候式解读”。,"The task of an Althusserian critical practice is to deconstruct the text to reveal the problematic.To do this is to perform what Althusser calls a ""symptomatic reading""."
10010,在阿诺德看来，只要外部环境稍稍发挥一点作用，“乌合之众”的“幽灵”就会成功占领“野蛮人”和“非利士人”的心灵。,"According to Arnold, it takes only a little help from ‘circumstances’ to make this ‘eternal spirit’ triumph in both Barbarian and Philistine."
10010,在这一问题上，文化具有两方面的功能。,Culture has two functions in this scenario.
10010,第一，文化必须小心翼翼地指引贵族和中产阶级，使其免受外部环境的影响。,"First, it must carefully guide the aristocracy and the middle class from such circumstances."
10010,第二，对于那些心中仍然存留着所谓“人性”的工人阶级，文化必须为他们提供“一种不可或缺的道德标准……使他们尊重权威，克服自身的无政府倾向，不再对我们构成威胁”。,"Second, it must bring to the working class, the class in which this so-called human nature is said to reside, ‘a much wanted principle... of authority, to counteract the tendency to anarchy that seems to be threatening us’."
10010,而要想建立这种权威的道德标准，就必须有一个强大的、中央集权的国家。,"The principle of authority, as we shall see, is to be found in a strong centralized State."
10011,武士道这个正式名称是近代才有的。它不象“迫于情义”、“完全出于情义”、“为情义而竭尽全力”等格言那样有深厚的民族感情背景。,"Bushido is a modern official term which has not the deep folk-feeling behind it that 'cornered with giri,' 'merely for giri', 'working strongly for giri' have in Japan."
10011,它也不能包罗“情义”的复杂性和多样性。,Nor does it cover the complexities and the ambivalences of girli.
10011,它是评论家出于灵感的创作。,It is a publicist's inspiration.
10012,与“戏仿”一样，“混仿”也是对某种独特假面或某种僵化语言的模拟，不过这种模拟是一种中立的实践，并不似“戏仿”一般基于某种隐秘的动机。“混仿”既无讽刺挖苦之意，更无诱人发笑之功；它认为人们偶然说出的反常言语中并不隐含着任何既定的惯例，而某些正常的语言规范依旧存在。,"Pastiche is, like parody, the imitation of a peculiar mask, speech in a dead language: but it is a neutral practice of such mimicry, without any of parody's ulterior motives, amputated of the satiric impulse, devoid of laughter and of any conviction that alongside the abnormal tongue you have momentarily borrowed, some healthy linguistic normality still exists."
10012,故而，“混仿”乃是一种空白的戏仿。,Pastiche is thus blank parody
10013,但是，孝道的性质则不可避免地有所改动，以适应日本家庭的不同结构。,"The character of filial piety, however, was inevitably modified to suit the different structure of the family in Japan."
10013,在中国，甚至现在，一个人仍然必须对其大宗族尽忠。,"In China, even today, one owes loyalty to one's vast extended clan."
10013,这个大宗族可能有成千上万个成员，宗族对全体成员拥有裁决权，并受到这些成员的支持。,It may number tens of thousands of people over whom it has jurisdiction and from whom it receives support.
10014,“新陈代谢”一项指进食、消化、相关分泌、营养吸收和废物排泄的过程。它以几种方式与环境因素以及机体与外部世界的互动相关。这种互动由文化所限定。,"Thus, the entry metabolism means that the processes of food intake, digestion, the collateral secretions, the absorption of nutritive substances, and rejection of waste matter are related in several ways to environmental factors and the interaction between the organism and the outside world, an interaction culturally framed."
10014,也就是说，我们在此把前表中分别陈述的几种要素压缩成类。,"We have, thus, condensed here the several drives which were separately stated in our previous table."
10014,固体食物、饮料和氧气的供给均由新陈代谢过程决定，排泄过程也不例外，个体在此过程中再次依靠环境。,"The supply of solid foods, of liquids, and of oxygen is all determined by the metabolic processes, and so are the processes of excretion, in which the individual once more resorts to the environment."
10015,大众文化的政治是日常生活的政治。,The politics of popular culture is that of everyday life.
10015,这意味着大众文化在 微观政治的层面，而非宏观政治的层面，进行运作，而且它是循序渐进式的，而非激进式的。,"This means that it works on the micropolitical level, not the macro level, and that it is progressive, not radical."
10015,它关注的是发生在家庭、切身的工作环境、教室等结构当中，日复一日与不平等权力关系所进行的防商。,"It is concerned with the day-to-day negotiations of unequal power relations in such structures as the family, the immediate work environment, and the classroom."
10016,顺便可以提到，葛兰西的理论有一些次要的但依然有意义的问题。,There are a number of secondary but still significant problems with Gramsci's theory.
10016,例如，把霸权同压制清楚地分开，存在着困难，因为霸权本身就可能是压制。,"For example, there is the difficulty with separating hegemony from coercion, since hegemony can itself be coercive."
10016,霸权还是一种统治形式，而压制可以用一种霸权的方式来运用。,"Hegemony is about domination, while coercion can be used in a hegemonic fashion."
10017,"上述论点比较接近于霍尔(1986)晚期的“言传理论""（theory of articulation )。在这 —理论中，霍尔说明了文本在大众文化中运作的双重方式。其一为文本中心的方式，其二为读者中心的方式。","This accords better with Hall's (1986) later theory of articulation, in which he accounts for the double way in which texts work in popular culture: a text-centered way, and a reader-centered way."
10018,考沃德之所以对言情小说产生兴趣，在很大程度上缘于“过去十年间(20世纪70年代），女性主义和雨后春笋般风靡的言情小说几乎是同步发展的”。,"Coward's interest in romantic fiction is in part inspired by the intriguing fact that ""over the past decade [the 1970s], the rise of feminism has been paralleled almost exactly by a mushroom growth in the popularity of romantic fiction""."
10018,关于言情小说，她提出了两个观点。,She believes two things about romantic novels.
10018,第一，所有小说必定满足着某些特定的需求”；第二，这些小说为“某个无比强大的共同幻景”提供佐证、作出贡献。,"First, that ""they must still satisfy some very definite needs""; and second, that they offer evidence of, and contribute to, ""a very powerful and common fantasy""."
10019,尤其是，“该理论体系将注意力从‘在异性恋文化中做一个同性恋者意味着什么’转移到‘文化是如何创造出异性恋的种种表现形式的’，旨在于一向严苛的异性恋文化中为‘反常性’找到相应的位置”（同上）。,"Moreover, ‘by shifting the focus away from the question of what it means to be lesbian or gay within the culture, and onto the various performances of heterosexuality created by the culture, Queer Theory seeks to locate Queerness in places that had previously been thought of as strictly for the straights’ (ibid.)."
10019,由是，二人宣称：“酷儿理论并非仅仅‘关于’同性恋者，正如女性研究也并非仅仅‘关于’女人一样。事实上，酷儿理论所要攻击的乃是……性别之分的‘理所当然性’，及其所竭力维护的异性恋霸权。”（同上）,"In this way, they contend, ‘Queer Theory is no more “about” lesbians and gay men than women’s studies is “about” women. Indeed, part of the project of Queer is to attack...the very “naturalness” of gender and, by extension, the fictions supporting compulsory heterosexuality’."
10020,据说，是公共服务，而不是私利，才决定了所生产的东西。,"Public service, not private profit, is said to determine what gets produced."
10020,然而，默多克和戈尔丁却论证说，像英国广播公司这样的国家媒介机构，实际上运作起来就像是商业企业，而不是公共服务机构。,"However, Murdock and Golding argue that state media institutions such as the BBC have in practice to operate as if they were commercial enterprises and not public services."
10020,他们不得不去议会，以便说服政府维持或者提高他们的许可证费。,The BBC has to persuade governments to maintain or raise its licence fee.
10021,从文化上说，人类中的一小部分脱离原始状态不过是昨天的事情。,"It is only yesterday, culturologically speaking, that a small portion of mankind began to emerge from a condition of savagery."
10021,迄今为止，人的大部分生计是完全依赖于野生食物的。实际上，自农业产生开始，人类历史不过流逝了2%的时间。,"For most of his career thus far man has subsisted wholly upon wild foods; less than two per cent of human history, as a matter of fact, has elapsed since the origin of agriculture."
10022,解剖学家还未能发现，为什么人能使用符号，而类人猿却不能。,The anatomist has not been able to discover why men can use symbols and apes cannot.
10022,已知的人脑和猿脑的唯一区别是量的区别。如卡尔逊所评论过的那样：“……人并没有某种新的脑细胞或脑细胞网络”。,"So far as is known the only difference between the brain of man and the brain of an ape is a quantitative one: "". . . man has no new kinds of brain cells or brain cell connections,"" as A. J. Carlson has remarked."
10023,对“外来”之含义的第二个误解在于人们常常将“本土的”等同于“国家的”，却不知即使在一个国家内部也会存在许多个本土文化。,"Another problem with this very limited notion of the foreign is that it is always assumed that the ‘local’ is the same as the national.But within the national, there may well be many ‘locals’."
10023,而且，本土文化之间及其与宰制性文化（“国家文化”）之间还存在着不容忽视的矛盾冲突。,"Moreover, there may be considerable conflict between them, and between them and the dominant culture (i.e.‘the national’)."
10023,因此，全球化既能强化本土文化，又可破坏本土文化；既能让个体安于某地，又可使之产生远离某地的感觉。,Globalization can therefore both help confirm and help undo local cultures; it can keep one in place and it can make one suddenly feel out of place.
10024,这个简要的概括实际上是我们以下更全面分析的蓝图。它表明科学的人类学是基于制度的理论，即对组织单位类型的具体分析。,"This brief outline, which is really a blueprint for our following fuller analysis, indicates that scientific anthropology consists in a theory of institutions, that is, a concrete analysis of the type units of an organization."
10024,作为一种关于基本需求，关于功用和整合驱力之衍生的理论，科学的人类学提供给我们功能的分析，使我们能界定习俗性观念和发明能力的形式和意义。,"As a theory of basic needs, and a derivation of instrumental and integrative imperatives, scientific anthropology gives us the functional analysis, which allows us to define the form, as well as the meaning, of a customary idea or contrivance."
10024,显而易见，这样一种科学的研究方法在任何意义上都不排斥或否认进化或历史研究的有效性，它只是给它们提供一个科学的基础。,It can easily be seen that such a scientific approach does not by any means override or deny the validity of evolutionary or historical pursuits.It simply supplies them with a scientific basis.
10025,史蒂文•康纳认为，《后现代状况》可被视为“对学术知识与学术机构在当下世界中的状况的隐秘寓言”。,Steven Connor suggests that The Postmodern Condition may be read ‘as a disguised allegory of the condition of academic knowledge and institutions in the contemporary world’.
10025,"在某种意义上,利奥塔“‘诊断’的并非所谓后现代状况，而是徒劳无益的当代知识分子”（同上）。","Lyotard’s ‘diagnosis of the postmodern condition is, in one sense, the diagnosis of the final futility of the intellectual’ (ibid.)."
10025,在他看来，当代知识分子身上充满了“消极英雄主义”的色彩。,Lyotard is himself aware of what he calls the contemporary intellectual’s ‘negative heroism’.
10025,“整个20世纪60年代对学术界的粗暴攻击和猛烈批评”导致知识分子丧失了原本的权威性。,"Intellectuals have, he argues, been losing their authority since ‘the violence and critique mounted against the academy during the sixties’."
10026,罗兰•巴尔特写于早年的大众文化研究著作关注指意的过程，以及意义的生产和流通机制。,"Roland Barthes's early work on popular culture is concerned with the processes of signification, the mechanisms by which meanings are produced and put into circulation."
10026,《神话学》—书就以法国的大众文化为考察的对象。,Mythologies is a collection of essays on French popular culture.
10026,在这部著作中，巴尔特对诸多文化形态进行了讨论，包括角斗、肥皂粉与清洁剂、玩具、牛排与薯片、旅游，以及公众对科学的态度，等等。,"In it he discusses, among many things, wrestling, soap powders and detergents, toys, steak and chips, tourism and popular attitudes towards science."
10027,比如说“黑”与“白”是一种二元对立结构，当我们对“黑”作出界定的时候，总是意味着“白”作为一种缺席而存在。,"Black and white, it could be argued, exist in a binary opposition, one always existing as the absent other when one of the terms is defined."
10027,然而不难发现，在很多权力话语中，“白”是正面的、积极的，相对于“黑”而言具有优越性。,"But it is not difficult to see how in many powerful discourses, white is the positive term, holding priority and privilege over black."
10027,拋开种族主义话语不说，在历史中始终存在着“白”优“黑”劣的思维模式。,"Even leaving aside racism, there is a long history of black connoting negatively and white connoting positively."
10028,一方面，有争议的是，资本主义不如法兰克福学派所认为的稳定。另一方面，它并没有不断面临革命工人阶级运动绝对的或明确的威胁。,"Capitalism is arguably less stable than the Frankfurt School theory recognises, but neither has it been continually confronted by the implicit or explicit threat of a revolutionary working-class movement."
10028,如果这种推论似乎有理的话，那么通俗文化就不可能按照它确保资本主义持续稳定的基本作用来理解。,"If this is the case, popular culture cannot be seen as playing a functional role in ensuring the continued stability of capitalism."
10029,在巴特看来，撇开法国古典主义的做作不论，它既不是中立的和普遍的，也不是自然的和必然的。,"For Barthes, French classicism, irrespective of its pretensions, is neither neutral and universal nor natural and inevitable."
10029,相反，必须把它置于它的历史语境和社会语境之中。,"Instead, it has to be located in its historical and social contexts."
10029,照此，极为重要的是17世纪和19世纪之间资产阶级霸权的崛起，以及从1850年代以来出现的对这一霸权的挑战。,"As such, it is central to the rise of bourgeois hegemony between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries, and to the emergence of challenges to this hegemony from the 1850s onwards."
10030,普韦布洛人不知道什么是自设苦刑。,The Pueblos do not understand self-torture.
10030,每个人的手都有五个指头，不会短缺。除非它们为得到巫法忏悔而受到折磨，它们是不能给予伤害的。,"Every man's hand has its five fingers, and unless they have been tortured to secure a sorcery confession they are unscarred."
10031,与之相关，文化与政治的民主化进程在利维斯主义者看来简直是天方夜谭。,The threat of democracy in matters both cultural and political is a terrifying thought for Leavisism.
10031,此外，利维斯夫人还声称：“权力的拥有者不再是知识权威和文化的代表。,"Moreover, according to Q.D. Leavis, ‘The people with power no longer represent intellectual authority and culture’."
10031,”和阿诺德一样，她也认为传统权威的坍塌是伴随着大众民主的兴起而到来的。,"Like Arnold, she sees the collapse of traditional authority coming at the same time as the rise of mass democracy."
10032,欲望通常来自日常生活之外，可对于大多数女性而言却只能通过一种日常生活行为获得满足，那就是购物。,"Desire is generated for something more than the everyday, yet it can only be accomplished by what is for most women an everyday activity--shopping."
10032,女性杂志、文章广告、时尚信息、家居装饰、烹饪化妆……上述种种所竭力兜售的，乃是一种既成功且怡人的女性气质。,"What is ultimately being sold in the fictions of women’s magazines, in editorial or advertisements, fashion and home furnishing items, cookery and cosmetics, is successful and therefore pleasurable femininity."
10032,只有采纳了某些建议，或购买了某些东西，才能成为一个更好的恋人、更好的母亲、更好的妻子以及更好的女人。,"Follow this practical advice or buy this product and be a better lover, a better mother, a better wife, and a better woman."
10033,对瓦利斯•巴奇来说，埃赫那顿是“宗教狂，他不容异说，骄傲自大而又固执己见，但又是个诚挚与直率的人。,"To E. A. Wallis Budge, Ikhnaton was ""a religious fanatic, intolerant, arrogant and obstinate, but earnest and sincere."""
10033,”他说，“除了半疯狂的人而外”，没有人“敢于如此无视现实，以至于试图废除阿门及对他的崇拜。”,"No one, he says, ""but a half-insane man would have been so blind to facts as to attempt to overthrow Amen and his worship."""
10034,霸权的“均势妥协”还可被用来分析大众文化内部及大众文化所折射出的其他类型的冲突。,The compromise equilibrium of hegemony can also be employed to analyse different types of conflict within and across popular culture.
10034,本内特强调的是阶级冲突，除此之外，族裔、“种族”、性别、代际、性征、身体缺陷等范畴内的冲突也同样适用，因为所有这些冲突都在不同的情况下参与到了旨在对抗主流或宰制性力量之收编的文化斗争之中。,"Bennett highlights class conflict, but hegemony theory can also be used to explore and explain conflicts involving ethnicity, ‘race’, gender, generation, sexuality, disability, etc.--all are at different moments engaged in forms of cultural struggle against the homogenizing forces of incorporation of the official or dominant culture."
10034,在对霸权理论的应用中，尤其是在后马克思主义的文化研究范式中，最关键的概念是“接合”(此处本词同时表达了两层意思，一是“表达自己的观点”，二是“与对方建立临时的关联”）。,"The key concept in this use of hegemony theory, especially in post-Marxist cultural studies, is the concept of ‘articulation’ (the word being employed in its double sense to mean both to express and to make a temporary connection)."
10035,可见弗雷泽不仅是他那代人类学的代言人，而且是现代科学人类学的先驱。,Thus Frazer is as much the pioneer in modern scientific anthropology as the spokesman of his generation.
10035,他的研究方法的根基不能动摇。,The ground-work of his approach cannot be rejected.
10035,比较方法仍是形成人类学科学普遍原理的主要理论工具。,The comparative method is still the main theoreThe Interpretation of Culturesal tool for the formulation of general principles of anthropological science.
10035,关于人类基本需求的假定必须继续是我们深入考察文化现象的出发点。,The assumption of man's primary needs must remain the starting point in our inquiry into cultural phenomena.
10035,人类学和人文学将永远不会完全摒弃进化原理及其基本理论概念（capital outfit)。,The evolutionary principle and its capital outfit will never become completely rejected by anthropology or humanism.
10036,按照现代人类学的原理，这个理论不值一驳。,
10036,,It is hardly necessary to refute this theory in the light of our modern anthropological principles.
10036,我们知道，暴力和革命的立法行动是我们现代文明的特征，在原始人中不可能发生。,"We know that violent and revolutionary acts of legislation are characteristics of our present civilization, but do not occur in primitive humanity."
10036,我们同时不得不问，这样的革命立法活动是发生了一次然后通过播化而扩布，还是在很多地点都于适当时刻发生。,"We still would have to ask whether such a revolutionary legislative act occurred once and then spread by diffusion, or whether it occurred in many cases and always at the right moment."
10037,工业化和城市化带来了三个巨变，重新勾画了文化的地图。,"As a result of industrialization and urbanization, three things happened, which together had the effect of redrawing the cultural map."
10037,首先，工业化改变了雇佣者和被雇佣者之间的关系。,"First of all, industrialization changed the relations between employees and employers."
10037,原本是基于相互债务责任的雇佣关系变成了如托马斯•卡莱尔所言的对“金钱关系”的渴求。,"This involved a shift from a relationship based on mutual obligation to one based solely on the demands of what Thomas Carlyle calls the ""cash nexus""."
10037,其次，城市化造成了阶级与阶级居住地的彼此分离。,"Second, urbanization produced a residential separation of classes."
10038,在对文化整合进行理解时，有一个社会事实必须予以考虑。,There is a sociological fact that must be taken into account in any understanding of cultural integration.
10038,这就是传播的意义，人类学巨大的主体研究已致力于了解人类模仿的事实。,This is the significance of diffusion.A vast body of anthropological work has been devoted to plumbing the facts of human imitativeness.
10038,原始地区特质传播的范围就是极其惊人的人类学事实之一。,The extent of the primitive areas over which traits have diffused is one of the most startling facts of anthropology.
10039,各藩藩界设有哨所关卡，查验过往行人，严禁“出女入炮”，以防止大名私运妇女出境或偷运武器入境。,Passport and customs officials were maintained at the frontiers of the fiefs to keep strict watch for 'outgoing women and incoming guns' lest any daimyo try to send his women away and smuggle arms in.
10039,非经将军许可，大名不能联姻，以防止导致任何政治联盟的危险。,No daimyo could contract a marriage without the Shogun's permission lest it might lead to a dangerous political alliance.
10039,藩与藩之间的通商也受到阻碍，甚至彼此之间不能架桥。,Trade between the fiefs was hindered even to the extent of allowing bridges to become impassable.
10040,伯纳德•罗森伯格（他与大卫•曼宁•怀特同为该书的主编）声称，富庶、安定的美国社会正在遭遇来自群氓文化的非人性的破坏。,Bernard Rosenberg (co-editor with David Manning White) argues that the material wealth and well-being of American society are being undermined by the dehumanizing effects of mass culture.
10040,他最大的担忧在于：“最糟糕的是，群氓文化不仅威胁到了我们的审美趣味，更会铺设一条通向冷酷无情的独裁主义的道路。,"His greatest anxiety is that, ‘At worst, mass culture threatens not merely to cretinize our taste, but to brutalize our senses while paving the way to totalitarianism’."
10040,”他还认为，流氓文化既不是美国土生土长的文化，也不是民主制度的必然结果。,"He claims that mass culture is not American by nature, or by example, nor is it the inevitable culture of democracy."
10040,在罗森伯格看来，群氓文化在苏联最普遍。,"Mass culture, according to Rosenberg, is nowhere more widespread than in the Soviet Union."
10040,其始作俑者不是资本主义，而是科技。,"Its author is not capitalism, but technology."
10041,不过，日本从一开始起就未能复制中国那种无等级的社会组织。,"Japan, however, from the very first, failed to reproduce China's casteless social organization."
10041,日本所采纳的官位制，在中国是授给那些经过科举考试合格的行政官员的；在日本却授给世袭贵族和封建领主。,"The official titles Japan adopted were in China given to administrators who had passed the State examinations, but in Japan they were given to hereditary nobles and feudal lords."
10041,这些就成了日本等级制的组成部分。,They became part of the caste arrangements of Japan.
10042,首先，艾柯建构了该小说以之为基础的一系列对立面。,Eco constructs the series of oppositions upon which the novels are based.
10042,这些对立面与列维斯特劳斯的二元对立面非常相似，可以彼此进行组合与再组合，并且是“直接的和普遍的”。,"These oppositions, which are very similar to Lévi-Strauss's binary oppositions, can be combined and recombined with each other, and are ""immediate and universal""."
10042,它们的“置换和相互作用”意味着，每个对立面的结合、联系和表现在某神程度上可以随着每一部小说而变化。,"Their ""permutation and interaction"" means that the combination, association and representation of each opposition can be varied, to some extent, from novel to novel."
10043,当阿诺德和利维斯惊恐于“无政府状态”，法兰克福学派眼中却只有人们对权力阶级的“遵从”：在这种情况下，“被蒙蔽的大多数”被困在一个“循环往复的操纵性的怪圈里，而整个系统的一致性也就日益增强”。,"Where Arnold and Leavis saw ‘anarchy’, the Frankfurt School see only ‘conformity’: a situation in which ‘the deceived masses’ are caught in a ‘circle of manipulation and retroactive need in which the unity of the system grows ever stronger’."
10043,阿多诺曾经对一部美国情景喜剧作出解读。在该剧中，有一位年轻的女教师，每个月只领微薄的薪水（一成不变），而且还经常被校长罚款。,"Here is Adorno reading an American situation comedy about a young schoolteacher who is both underpaid [some things do not change], and continually fined by her school principal."
10043,最后，她变得一贫如洗，连饭都吃不饱。,"As a result, she is without money and therefore without food."
10043,剧情的笑点在于这名女教师经常想方设法在朋友或熟人处“蹭饭”的情节。,The humour of the storyline consists in her various attempts to secure a meal at the expense of friends and acquaintances.
10044,其结果便是，真实与仿真带给人们的体验别无二致，就像过山车一样绵延不绝，毫无差异。,The result is that reality and simulation are experienced as without difference - operating along a roller-coaster continuum.
10044,而且，仿真有时甚至比真实本身显得更加真实——“比实实在在的东西还棒”。,"Simulations can often be experienced as more real than the real itself – ""even better than the real thing"" ."
10044,我们不妨回头想想那部名为《现代启示录》的越战影片——它已经变成衡量表征的现实主义的标杆了。,Think of the way in which Apocalypse Now has become the mark against which to judge the realism of representations of America's war in Vietnam.
10044,在观众眼中，越南战争只有“像”《现代启示录》中展现的那样，才可被称为一场真实的战争。,"Asking if it has the ""look"" of Apocalypse Now is virtually the same as asking if it is realistic."
10045,“情义”则既与中国儒教无关，也非来自东方的佛教。,But giri owes to no Chinese Confucianism and to no Oriental Buddhism.
10045,它是日本独有的范畴，不了解情义就不可能了解日本人的行为方式。,It is a Japanese category and it is not possible to understand their courses of action without taking it into account.
10045,日本人在谈及行为的动机、名誉以及他在本国所遇到的各种麻烦时，都经常要说到“情义”。,No Japanese can talk about motivations or good repute or the dilemmas which confront men and women in his home country without constantly speaking of giri.
10046,巴尔特指出：“是符号学使我们了解到神话的历史意向，及其妄图将政治观念自然化的野心。在当下，这一过程指的就是中产阶级的意识形态。,"According to Barthes, ""Semiology has taught us that myth has the task of giving an historical intention a natural justification, and making contingency appear eternal. Now this process is exactly that of bourgeois ideology""."
10046,"”在巴尔特眼中，“神话是在历史质地丧失的过程中被建构出来的；在神话中，事物全然失去了自己曾经是""人造之物""的记忆”。","His argument is that ""myth is constituted by the loss of the historical quality of things: in it, things lose the memory that they once were made""."
10047,工人阶级……粗野而未开化……长久以来半隐于贫困与肮脏之中……如今竟然从藏身之所跳了出来，宣称自己和所有英国人一样拥有上天赐予的自由。他们想在哪游行就在哪游行，想在哪聚会就在哪聚会，想说什么脏话就说什么脏话，想打砸什么地方就打砸什么地方。这真是一件令我们困惑的事。,"The working class . . . raw and half developed . . . long lain half hidden amidst its poverty and squalor . . . now issuing from its hiding place to assert an Englishman's heaven born privilege of doing as he likes, and beginning to perplex us by marching where it likes, meeting where it likes, bawling what it likes, breaking what it likes."
10048,麦当娜作为一个文本，甚至作为一系列文本，是不完整的，除非 她被放进社会流通之中。,"Madonna as a text, or even as a series of texts, is incomplete until she is put into social circulation."
10048,她的性别政治不在于她的文本性，而 是在于她的功能性。,"Hergender politics lie not in her textuality, but in her functionality."
10048,她是一个典型的大众文本，因为她充满了 矛盾——她包含了父权制式的女性性征的意义，同时也包含与 前者相对抗的意义，因为她的性征是她自备的，她可以用她所希望的方式来使用，而不需要男性的同意,She is an exemplary popular text because she is so full of feminine sexuality and the resisting ones that her sexuality is hers to use as she wishes in ways that do not require masculine approval.
10049,不过，没有任何理由猜测这种边缘具有普遍的关联。,"However, there is no reason to suppose that this hierarchy has universal relevance."
10049,它也没有必要排斥变化。,Nor need it be closed to changes.
10049,“西方古典音乐重在旋律与和谐，而当代波普音乐则重在音色与内涵”，“嘟-呜普”的内涵是“1950年代青少年的波普文化”和“都市街头的各个角落”。,"""Western classical music focused on melody and harmony, whereas contemporary pop music focuses on timbre and connotation"", the connotation of doo-wop being ""fifties teen pop culture"" and ""urban street corners""."
10050,每个驱力都控制着一种特定的表现类型，而每个关键序列在很大程度上都独立于其他序列。,"Each drive commands a specific type of performance, and each vital sequence is to a large extent independent of others."
10050,至此，形态和功能的问题，我们只能够证明两者都可以在分析的层次上确定。,"As regards the problem of form and function, it will be possible to show that we can already define both at this level of analysis."
10050,我们的关键序列中的每一项，都有其确定的形态。,Each of our vital sequences has its definite form.
10050,每一种都可以从解剖学、生理学和物理学上加以描述。,"Each can be described in terms of anatomy, physiology and physics."
10051,在第一次海湾战争开始前几周，《新闻周刊》（1990年12月10日出版）在封面刊出了一张老布什总统表情严肃的特写照片。,"In the weeks leading up to the first Gulf War, Newsweek (10 December 1990) featured a cover showing a photograph of a serious-looking George Bush."
10051,照片上方印着一行大标题：“这绝不会成为另一场越战。,"Above the photograph was the banner headline, ‘This will not be another Vietnam’."
10051,”该标题源自布什此前所做的一次演讲，原话是：“我知道，国民担心越南战争的悲剧重演。我向大家保证……这绝不会成为另一场越战。”,"The headline was taken from a speech made by Bush in which he said, ‘In our country, I know that there are fears of another Vietnam. Let me assure you ....this will not be another Vietnam’."
10052,互文性也许并不是大众文化所独有的。它在“高雅”文化对 《闪灵》进行的阅读中，也起到了重要作用。但是，它的运作方式是不同的。,"Intertextuality may not be unique to popular culture—it was central to the ""high"" cultural readings of The Shining as well, but it works differently."
10052,高雅文化围绕“作者艺术家”建立互文关系，这比围绕类型或性别政治建立的互文性要有限许多，而且髙雅文化将文本视为技巧高超的对象。,"The high cultural intertextual relations organized around the author-artist are more limiting than ones organized around genre or gender politics, and they accord well with the status of the text as a crafted object."
10053,如阿诺德、利维斯和某些美国群氓文化理论家一样，法兰克福学派对大众文化问题的论述根本就是一种居髙临下、对他人的文化指手画脚的话语（一种严格区分了“我们”和“他们”的话语）。,"Like the perspective developed by Arnold, Leavisism and some of the American mass culture theorists, the Frankfurt School perspective on popular culture is essentially a discourse from above on the culture of other people (a discourse of ‘us’ and ‘them’)."
10053,不过，法兰克福学派还是对那些出于自身利益而深切缅怀昔日“纯洁”、自治的文化传统的保守主义理论家进行了严厉的批判。,"It is true that the Frankfurt School are very critical of conservative cultural critics who bemoaned the passing of, or threat to, a ‘pure’ autonomous culture for its own sake."
10053,"J.M.伯恩斯坦就曾指出，阿多诺“认为保守主义者对髙雅文化的捍卫其实是在通过对一种虚无缥缈的文化实体的缅怀来维护社会的经济现状""。","Adorno, as J.M. Bernstein points out, ‘regards the conservative defence of high culture as reflecting an unreflective hypostatization of culture that protects the economic status quo’."
10054,她是过度和浅白的，她超越了所有性感化的女性身体的规范，而且 用她裸露上腹的服饰来揭露这些规范的浅白性。,She is excessive and obvious; she exceeds all the norms of the sexualized female body and exposes their obviousness along with her midriff.
10054,她对她的肚脐 所作的性感化，戏仿了父权制将女性身体的某些部位性感化的做法。她是一个父权制的文本，但充斥着怀疑态度。,Her sexualization of her navel is a parody of patriarchy's eroticization of female body fragments—she is a patriarchal text shot through with skepticism.
10055,"对此，他解释道：“若仅将文本收编视作""空白的戏仿""是决然无法触及本质的。我们需要在混仿机制中添加各种分类，以厘清当下的流行音乐如何对其所窃文本进行反对、拥护与促进。”","As he explains, ""textual incorporation cannot be adequately understood as “blank parody”. We need categories to add to pastiche, which demonstrate how contemporary pop opposes, celebrates and promotes the texts it steals from""."
10056,大众文化的政治是日常生活的政治。,The politics of popular culture is that of everyday life.
10056,这意味着大众文化在微观政治的层面，而非宏观政治的层面，进行运作，而且它是循序渐进式的，而非激进式的。,"This means that it works on the micropolitical level, not the macro level, and that it is progressive, not radical."
10056,它关注的是发生在家庭、切身的工作环境、教室等结构当中，日复一日与不平等权力关系所进行的防商。,"It is concerned with the day-to-day negotiations of unequal power relations in such structures as the family, the immediate work environment, and the classroom."
10057,"结构主义被 认为与有关心理结构和文化结构普遍特征的各种主张相一致, 也与有关它们在引起可见的社会现象方面的因果作用的主张相 一致。","Structuralism claims that mental and cultural structures are universal, and that their causal effects give rise to observable social phenomena."
10057,在采取符号学的态度时，则不需要具备这样的主张。,"However, semiology need not be associated with either of these claims."
10057,这是我在本章里将保持的一种粗略的用法。,This is roughly the usage that will be followed in this chapter.
10057,我意识到，这并不能完 全令人满意，因为人们可以论证说，实际上，结构主义和符号学 以相同的方法研究相同的事物,It is not totally satisfactory because structuralism and semiology have studied the same things in similar ways.
10058,索绪尔对结构主义的发展作出的另一重要贡献是他对语言和言语的区分。,Saussure makes another distinction that has proved essential to the development of structuralism.This is the division of language into langue and parole.
10058,语言指的是人们借以表达的系统、规范与惯例，是一种社会机制。,"Langue refers to the system of language, the rules and conventions that organize it."
10058,正如罗兰•巴尔特指出的那样：“索绪尔所谓之语言，就是一个人为融人社区而必须接受的集体契约。,"This is language as a social institution, and as Roland Barthes  points out, ""it is essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one wishes to communicate"" ."
10058,”而言语指的则是个体言说的方式以及对语言的具体运用。,"Parole refers to the individual utterance, the individual use of language."
10059,在进化过程中，无论其为社会进化还是生物进化，我们几乎总是发现新的发展是从旧事物中生长出来，或是以之作为基础的。这里的情况便是如此。,"In the evolutionary process, whether it be social or biological, we almost always find the new growing out of, or based upon, the old."
10059,为攫取食物和防御外敌而建立的新的协作组织，是根据已经存在的结构即家庭而建立起来的。,And such was the case here; the new co-operative organization for food and defense was built upon a structure already present: the family.
10060,除窥视欲外，大众电影还催生并满足了另一种快感：“所谓的窥视欲是在自恋的氛围中滋生出来的。,Popular cinema promotes and satisfies a second pleasure: ‘developing scopophilia in its narcissistic aspect’ (ibid.).
10060,”（同上）此处，墨维援引拉康的“镜像阶段”理论（前文中有介绍），指出由电影制造出来的身份认同的快感与儿童的“自我”的构成具有高度的相似性。,Here Mulvey draws on Lacan’s account of the ‘mirror stage’ (see earlier section) to suggest that there is an analogy to be made between the constitution of a child’s ego and the pleasures of cinematic identification.
10060,就像婴儿会对镜中自己的影像产生认同和误认一样，观众也会对银幕上的“自我”产生认同和误认。,"Just as a child recognizes and misrecognizes itself in the mirror, the spectator recognizes and misrecognizes itself on the screen."
10061,若想对“自然而然的”性别和异性恋霸权的虚构意识形态展开讨论，最佳方式莫过于从酷儿理论的奠基之著——茱迪丝•巴特勒那部影响深远的《性别麻烦》——入手。,"To discuss the supposed naturalness of gender and the ideological fictions supporting compulsory heterosexuality, there is no better place to begin than with one of the founding texts of queer theory, Judith Butler's very influential book Gender Trouble."
10061,巴特勒首先援引西蒙娜•德•波伏娃的名言：“女人并非生为女人，而是后天变成女人的”。,"Butler begins from Simone de Beauvoir's  observation that ""one is not born a woman, but, rather, becomes one""."
10061,波伏娃将人的性别划分为生物性别(“自然的”）和社会性别(“文化的”）两种，进而指出：尽管生物性别是天生稳定的，但后天之中却始终存在各种各样相互竞争的（因历史和社会的不同而异）女性气质和男性气质的“版本”。,"De Beauvoir's distinction establishes an analytical difference between biological sex (""nature"") and gender (""culture""), suggesting that while biological sex is stable, there will always be different and competing (historically and socially variable) ""versions"" of femininity and masculinity."
10062,身体及其快感一直是并且仍将是权力与规避、规训与解放 相互斗争的场所。在这一章，我希望探索此中的一些方式。虽 然身体看起来是我们最个人化的部分，但它也是身体政治（阶级性的身体、种族性的身体以及性别化的身体）的物质形式。,"In this chapter, I wish to trace some of the ways in which the body and its pleasures have been, and continue to be, the site of a struggle between power and evasion, discipline and liberation; though the body may appear to be where we are most individual, it is also the material form of the body politic: the class body, the racial body, and the body of gender."
10063,对于那些不怎么爱看通俗小说的人而言，最大的危险则来自电影。,"For those not addicted to popular fiction, there is always the danger of cinema."
10063,电影大行其道，已成为一个极度危险的快感之源：“电影有一种催眠术般的魔力，使人们沦陷于廉价的情感诉求中不能自拔。这种诉求用心险恶，因为它伴随着关于真实生活的某种不由自主且栩栩如生的幻觉。”,"Its popularity makes it a very dangerous source of pleasure indeed: ""they [films] involve surrender, under conditions of hypnotic receptivity, to the cheapest emotional appeals, appeals the more insidious because they are associated with a compellingly vivid illusion of actual life"" ."
10064,或者以礼仪规则为例。在某些社会中不准许男人戴耳环或使用口红。,"Or, take the rules of etiquette: A man in a certain society is not permitted to wear earrings or to use lipstick."
10064,这些限定的目的是为了在社会中确立个人的等级：男人、女人和僧侣等等，是以一定方式积极活动的个人，他（她）必须限制某些类别的行为。,"The purpose of these restrictions is to define classes of individuals within society: a man, woman, priest, etc., is an individual who behaves positively in a certain manner and who must refrain from certain kinds of acts."
10065,大众文明及伴随而来的群氓文化架设了一个极具破坏力的战场，时刻威胁着我们，要使我们“不可避免地陷人混乱之中”。,"Mass civilization and its mass culture pose a subversive front, threatening‘to land us in irreparable chaos’."
10065,正是为了与大众文明展开斗争，利维斯主义才登上了历史舞台，竭力鼓吹“要在学校教育中加人抵制（群氓文化）的训练”。在学校之外，利维斯主义主张“‘少数人’应当武装起来，主动出击，自觉地采用各种抵抗的形式”。,"It is against this threat that Leavisism writes its manifestos, and proposes ‘to introduce into schools a training in resistance [to mass culture]’; and outside schools, to promote a ‘conscious and directed effort . . . [to] take the form of resistance by an armed and active minority’ (Q.D. Leavis, 1978: 270)."
10065,与之相关，文化与政治的民主化进程在利维斯主义者看来简直是天方夜谭。,The threat of democracy in matters both cultural and political is a terrifying thought for Leavisism.
10066,马克思主义一度是英国文化研究最主要的理论体系，如今却面临着来自后现代主义批评家的质疑。他们认为马克思主义带有目的论色彩，质疑其宏大叙事、实在论、经济主义、欧洲中心主义，及其在整个启蒙运动中的地位。不仅如此，东欧巨变后，社会主义运动名誉扫地，也令马克思主义饱受苛责。（McRobbie，1992: 719),"Marxism, a major point of reference for the whole cultural studies project in the UK, has been undermined not just from the viewpoint of the postmodern critics who attack its teleological propositions, its meta-narrative status, its essentialism, economism, Eurocentrism, and its place within the whole Enlightenment project, but also, of course, as a result of the events in Eastern Europe, with the discrediting of much of the socialist project (719)."
10067,许多新国家马上受到这两类问题的困扰。,Many of the new states are plagued by both these sorts of problems at once.
10067,首先，大多数国家之间的原生运动并没有涉及所有的分离国家，就像“泛”字开头的运动至少倾向于所做的那样，而是涉及到散居在几个国家中的少数民族。例如，统一和主权孟加尔运动，也许至此只是一种不成形的情感，目的是建立一个统一的主权的孟加拉国——即独立于印度与巴基斯坦的大孟加拉国。,"In the first place, most interstate primordial movements do not involve entire separate countries, as the pan-movements at least tend to do, but rather minorities scattered through several, for example:  the movement, or perhaps it is so far only a formless sentiment, for a unified and sovereign Bengal—greater Bangladesh—independent of both India and Pakistan."
10068,不过，另一些人则把美国与民主、现代性、合理性和科学联系起来。,"Others, however, associated America with democracy, modernity, rationality and science."
10068,例如，科学家T.H.赫胥黎认为，美国代表着科学的、合理的未来的前途。,"The scientist T.H.Huxley, for example, saw America as representing the promise of a scientific and rational future."
10068,赫胥黎是个乐观主义者，对他来说，试图维护衰落中的社会形式与文化形式毫无真正的益处。,Huxley was an optimist who saw little benefit in trying to preserve social and cultural forms which were in decline.
10069,在第一章中我们曾经讨论过英国保守党在政治节目中将红色监狱栅栏用作“社会主义”的意象的例子。,I discussed in Chapter 1 how the Conservative Party presented a party political broadcast that concluded with the word ‘socialism’ being transposed into red prison bars.
10069,此举显然表明保守党试图在次级指意系统（内涵系统）内将“社会主义”这个词固定到“限制、囚禁、反自由”等意义上。,"This was undoubtedly an attempt to fix the secondary signification or connotations of the word ‘socialism’ to mean restrictive, imprisoning, against freedom."
10069,在巴尔特眼中，这一“固定新内涵”的行为是在对神话的生产—对意识形态的生产—过程中完成的。,Barthes would see this as an example of the fixing of new connotations in the production of myth--the production of ideology.
10070,约翰•斯盖特古德将对血统的关注与奴隶制的存废问题结合起来。他在1792写道:一旦允许废除奴隶制，“世界各地的黑人都会跑到我们的国家来，聚众扎堆，与本地人杂居，进而玷染我们普通人的血统，导致犯罪率和罪犯人数的飙升。如此一来，英国将变成整个地球的污水槽，充斥着杂种、暴徒和游手好闲的流浪汉”。,"Linking this concern directly to the abolition of slavery, John Scattergood, writing in 1792, argued that if slavery is allowed to end, ""the Negroes from all parts of the world will flock hither, mix with the natives, spoil the breed of our common people, increase the number of crimes and criminals, and make Britain the sink of all the earth, for mongrels, vagrants, and vagabonds""."
10071,今日，女性主义至少涵括了四个截然不同的流派，分别是激进女性主义、马克思主义女性主义、自由主义女性主义，以及西尔维娅•沃尔比所言之“双重系统理论”。,"There are at least four different feminisms: radical, Marxist, liberal and what Sylvia Walby calls dual-systems theory."
10071,每一流派都从特定的角度揭示女性所受之社会压迫，并根据不同的原因提出相应的解决方案。,"Each responds to women’s oppression in a different way, positing different causes and different solutions."
10071,激进女性主义认为造成女性受压迫地位的首恶是父权制，在这一社会系统内，男性群体得以将自己的权力凌驾于女性群体之上。,"Radical feminists argue that women’s oppression is the result of the system of patriarchy, a system of domination in which men as a group have power over women as a group."
10072,她是过度和浅白的，她超越了所有性感化的女性身体的规范，而且用她裸露上腹的服饰来揭露这些规范的浅白性。,She is excessive and obvious; she exceeds all the norms of the sexualized female body and exposes their obviousness along with her midriff.
10072,她对她的肚脐所作的性感化，戏仿了父权制将女性身体的某些部位性感化的做法。她是一个父权制的文本，但充斥着怀疑态度。,Her sexualization of her navel is a parody of patriarchy's eroticization of female body fragments—she is a patriarchal text shot through with skepticism.
10073,大众文明及伴随而来的群氓文化架设了一个极具破坏力的战场时刻威胁着我们，要使我们“不可避免地陷入混乱之中”。,"Mass civilization and its mass culture pose a subversive front, threatening ‘to land us in irreparable chaos’."
10073,"正是为了与大众文明展开斗争，利维斯主义才登上了历史舞台，竭力鼓吹“要在学校教育中加人抵制（群氓文化）的训练""（Leavis，1933: 188—9)。在学校之外，利维斯主义主张“‘少数人’应当武装起来，主动出击，自觉地采用各种抵抗的形式”（Q.D. Leavis，1978: 270)。","It is against this threat that Leavisism writes its manifestos, and proposes ‘to introduce into schools a training in resistance [to mass culture]’ (Leavis, 1933: 188–9); and outside schools, to promote a ‘conscious and directed effort . . . [to] take the form of resistance by an armed and active minority’ (Q.D. Leavis, 1978: 270)."
10073,与之相关，文化与政治的民主化进程在利维斯主义者看来简直是天方夜谭。,The threat of democracy in matters both cultural and political is a terrifying thought for Leavisism.
10074,为生产所有这些器物，他们必须遵循技术规范，调节集体行为，并通过一系列活动来使知识、法律和伦理传统保持活力。如作分析，这些活动可表现为经济的、法律的、教育的、政治的、科学的、巫术的、宗教的以及伦理的。,"To produce all objects, they must follow the techniques, regulate collective behavior, and keep alive the tradition of knowledge, law, and ethics by a system of activities which, on analysis, can be shown to be economic, legal, educational, political, scientific, magical, religious, and ethical."
10074,物质设备、社会团结、个人培训以及能力发展等方面若出现长期退化，则最终不仅导致文化解体，而且会引发饥荒、大规模疫病、个人效能衰退，当然，还会有明显的人口下降。,"A permanent deterioration in material equipment, in social solidarity, in the training of the individual and the development of his abilities, would lead in the long run, not merely to the disorganization of culture, but also to starvation, large-scale disease, the deterioration of personal efficiency, hence also, obviously, to depopulation."
10075,现在还应更为确切地界定，身为社会研究一员的人类学，为什么和凭什么宣称自己是一门能使人的研究变得更加科学的直接贡献者。,"It remains now to define more specifically why and in what manner anthropology, of all social studies,can claim to be a direct contributor towards making the Study of Man more scientific."
10075,我首先要说明，科学方法明显不是人文学科领域中惟一的关注点和灵感源泉。,I would like to state first that the scientific approach is obviously not the only interest or inspiration in the domain of humanism.
10075,道德或哲学的观点；美学的、人道的或神学的热忱或灵感；因过去以一种既无需证实又无法否认，而使人神往，产生要知其为何物的欲望——这些都是所有人文学科的合法动机，如此等等。,"Moral or philosophical points of view;aesthetic, humanitarian, or theological zeal or inspiration;the desire to know what the past was because the past appeals to our sentiments in a manner which need not be vindicated but cannot be gainsaid all these are legitimate motivations in all humanities."
10076,历史学和社会学、经济学和法学，必须仔细地、认真地、谨慎地将它们的基础置于科学方法的基石之上。,"History and sociology, as well as economics and jurisprudence, must lay their foundations carefully, consciously and deliberately, on the bedrock of scientific method."
10076,社会科学还必须发展出心智力以控制机械力。,Social science also must develop into the power of mind used for the control of mechanical power.
10076,人文学科永远不会没有艺术的、情感的、道德的因素。,"Humanism will never cease to have its artistic, sentimental and moral elements."
10076,但伦理原则的内在精髄正是中肯确切，这一特质只有在伦理像依赖情感一样地忠实于事实的时候才能获得。,"But the very essence of ethical principles demands its cogency, and this can only be attained if the principle is as true to fact as it is indispensable to sentiment."
10077,融合文化的出现是三个因素共同作用的结果。,Convergence culture is the result of three factors.
10077,第一个因素是传媒所有权的集中。,The first is concentration of media ownership.
10077,对多种平台的占有促使传媒巨头们在不同平台之间传播媒体内容。,Owning a range of different platforms encourages producers to distribute content across these different platforms.
10077,例如，某传媒公司拍摄了一部电影，又出版了一本关于此部电影的书，同时还推出了相关的电子游戏，并通过自己旗下的杂志、报纸、网站以及手机公司对上述产品进行推广促销。,"So, for example, a company may publish the book of the film, together with the game based on both and promote these in its magazines and newspapers and through its internet sites and mobile phone companies."
10078,普韦布洛人对死亡的日神式态度，既不能免除亲人死亡，也不能避免对敌人的杀戮；最多能使它们成为祝福之源，并提供以最小的暴烈情绪超度它们的手段。,The Apollonian attitude of the Pueblos toward death cannot outlaw the death of relatives nor the killing of enemies; it can at its best only make them sources of blessing and provide means of getting past them with the least violence.
10078,团体内的杀人极少发生，所以那里几乎没有有关两部杀人记载的传说。如果发生了这种杀人事件，就通过家族集团之间作出的补偿安排，毫不费事地加以解决。,"Homicide, the taking of life within the group, occurs so seldom that there are hardly even tales remembered of it, but it occurs, it is settled without ado by payment arranged between the kin groups."
10079,在消费社会中，所有的商品既有实用价值，也有文化价值。,"In a consumer society, all commodities have cultural as well as functional values."
10079,"倘若将这一要点模式化，我们必须扩展原有的经济概念，把文化经济容纳进去。在文化经济中,流通过程并非货币的周转,而是意义和快感的传播。","To model this we need to extend the idea of an economy to include a cultural economy where the circulation is not one of money, but of meanings and pleasures."
10080,会社的功能是，用一个特设的组织来实施特定的目标、兴趣或理想。组织中的特定功用和活动都指向这个共同目的。,"The function of associations is the implementing of a specific purpose, interest, or ideal by an ad hoc organization in which specific instrumentalities and activities are directed to the common end."
10080,在职业群体中，我们看到技能、技术的贯彻，而教育、法律、权力之类的活动则构成该群体的整合功能。,"In occupational groups we see that the carrying out of skills, techniques, and such activities as education, law, and power, constitute the integral function of the group."
10081,在摔跤比赛中，比在任何其他的“体育运动”中，都更可能让无秩序的大众的快感，获得自由而公开的表达。,"In wrestling, probably more than in any other ""sport,"" the disorderly popular pleasures are given free and public expression."
10081,库宁海姆 (1982)也提到一种不冋却相对应的控制策略：除了试图挪用现有的体育运动之外，中产阶级也发明新的体育项目，譬如网球、 登山运动或者滑雪等。在这些项目中，中产阶级的精神风尚可 以播种在处女地上，而其成长也可以避开工人阶级“野草”的竞争。,"Cunningham (1982) also mentions a different, though parallel, strategy of control: as well as attempting to appropriate existing sports, the middle classes also invented new sports, such as tennis, mountaineering, or skiing, where their ethos could be planted on virgin soil and could flourish free from the competition of working-class weeds."
10082,除非将要素、“特质”、习俗或观念置于其相关的和真正的制度环境中，否则，它们就难以被界定，也不能被界定。,"No element, ""trait,"" custom, or idea is defined or can be defined except by placing it within its relevant and real institutional setting."
10082,因此我们坚持认为这样的制度分析不仅可能而且必不可少。,We are thus insisting that such institutional analysis is not only possible but indispensable.
10082,这里的主张是：制度乃是文化分析的真正单元。,It is maintained here that the institution is the real isolate of cultural analysis.
10082,我们同时主张，任何基于孤立特质或特质丛的讨论或例证只要违背了制度整合的原理，就必定有误。,"It is also maintained that any other type of discussion or demonstration in terms of isolated traits or trait complexes, other than those which would follow the institutional integration, must be incorrect."
10083,弗雷泽曾经影响过弗朗斯、伯格森、汤恩比和斯宾格勒等人物。,"Frazer has influenced men like Anatole France, Bergson, Arnold Toynbee and O.Spengler."
10083,与其他任何作者相比，弗雷泽不仅使民族志证据更为现成，而且更多地激励了历史学和心理学、哲学和伦理学领域的先锋思想家。,"Frazer, more than any other writer, has made ethnographic evidence available as well as inspiring to a host of pioneer thinkers in history and psychology, in philosophy and ethics."
10083,只消把受到人类学激励和影响的课题列出清单，这一点就一目了然：禁忌和图腾、巫术和族外婚、原始宗教形态和政治制度发展。,"This can be seen when the subjects with which anthropology has affected or inspired other studies are listed: taboo and totemism, magic and exogamy, forms of primitive religion and the development of political institutions."
10083,所有这些课题都经过弗雷泽的首先处理或充分研究。,All these subjects have been first handled or most adequately treated by Frazer.
10084,在这里，文字是通过两种方式发挥作用的。,The linguistic message works in two ways.
10084,一方面，它使读者获知图片的外延意义，即“这是一位表情凝重的摇滚乐明星”；而另一方面，它限制了图像的潜在内涵的“增生”过程，让我们明确这位摇滚乐明星之所以表情凝重，是因为他的一位挚友死于过量吸毒，因此，图中人是在深思“究竟毒品在摇滚乐文化中扮演了何种角色”的问题。,"It helps the reader to identify the denotative meaning of the image: this is a rock star looking reflective.Second, it limits the potential proliferation of the connotations of the image: the rock star is reflective because of the drug overdose by one of his closest friends.Therefore, the rock star is contemplating the role of drugs in rock music culture."
10084,此外，说明文字还有一个功能，那就是想方设法使读者相信内涵的意义是在外延的层面上展示出来的。,"Moreover, it tries to make the reader believe that the connotative meaning is actually present at the level of denotation."
10085,然而，符号学的任务是要超越这些外延，达到符号的内涵。,But the task of semiology is to go beyond these denotations to get to the connotations of the sign.
10085,这么做揭示了神话如何通过特定的各种符号起作用。在这个方面，可以发现神话建构的、虚构的和历史的定位。,"Doing this reveals how myth works through particular signs, and shows how the constructed, manufactured and historical location of the myth can be discovered."
10085,因时，神话的种种内涵可以得到确认：这看起来是一束玫瑰花，但它表示激情；这看起来是一幅黑人士兵向法国国旗敬礼的照片，但它的确表示了法帝主义的伟大和公正。,"The connotations of myths can thus be identified: this may appear to be a bunch of roses but it connotes passion; or this may appear to be a photo of a black soldier saluting the French flag, but it really connotes the grandeur and impartiality of French imperialism."
10086,这些看法在19世纪中、后期的“为艺术而艺术”运动中得到了最为极端的张扬。,"These ideas received their extreme expression in the ""art for art’s sake"" movement in the  mid-to-late  nineteenth  century."
10086,这是对资本主义工业化和文化商业化的出现的反应，也是对它们给艺术作品的韵味造成的威胁的回应。,"This was a reaction to the emergence of capitalist industrialisation and the commercialisation of culture, and the threats they posed to the aura of the work of art."
10086,本雅明最为关心的，正是“机械复制时代”的这些影响。,"It is these effects of ""the age of mechanical reproduction"" with which Benjamin is most concerned."
10087,隐匿在“宿命论”和“失败主义”指责背后的，是一种更深层次的批驳观念。,"Implicit in the charge of ""fatalism"" and ""defeatism"" is the further notion of refutation."
10087,将一种观点冠以“宿命论”，对许多学究来说，也就是将其宣布为错误的。,"To brand a view ""fatalistic"" is, to many minds, to call it false as well."
10087,“文化决定论”是宿命论，因此是错误的”，如果要将其推理方法明确表述出来，大概就是如此。,"""Cultural determinism is fatalistic and therefore false,"" is about the way the reasoning would go if it were made explicit."
10088,如我们所见，文明社会的社会系统分裂为统治阶级与被剥削阶级。,"The social system of civil society was, as we have seen, divided into a ruling class and an exploited class."
10088,后者创造财富，而前者则占有绝大部分财富。以至留给后者的不过是最低限额的生存资料而已。,The latter produced the wealth; the former appropriated so large a portion of it as to leave the latter with but minimum means of subsistence.
10089,通过对斯密进行症候式解读，马克思得以对“斯密著作的原始的可见的问题域，与包含在似是而非的无法回答任何问题的答案中的不可见的 问题域两者之间的冲突”进行分析（28)。,"By a symptomatic reading of Smith, Marx is able to construct for analysis ‘the problematic initially visible in his writings against the invisible problematic contained in the paradox of an answer which does not correspond to any question posed’ (28)."
10089,马克思本人曾经如是评价斯密：“理解亚当•斯密的自相矛盾之处很重要，因为正是这些自相矛盾让我们看到了他如何通过瞒天过海的方式掩盖了自己无法解决的实实在在的问题。”（Marx，1951: 146),"Marx (1951) himself says this of Smith, ‘Adam Smith’s contradictions are of significance because they contain problems which it is true he does not solve, but which he reveals by contradicting himself’ (146)."
10090,而且，由于武士道曾经是国家主义者和军国主义者的口号，随着这些领导人的信誉扫地，武土道的概念也正在受到怀疑。,"Besides, it became a slogan of the nationalists and militarists and the concept is discredited with the discrediting of those leaders."
10090,这绝不意味着日本人今后不再“懂情义”。,That will by no means mean that the Japanese will no longer 'know giri.'
10090,恰恰相反，现在正是西方人应当理解“情义”在日本的含义的更加重要的时期。,It is more important than ever for Westerners to understand what giri means in Japan.
10091,"对此，他解释道：“若仅将文本收编视作""空白的戏仿""是决然无法触及本质的。我们需要在混仿机制中添加各种分类，以厘清当下的流行音乐如何对其所窃文本进行反对、拥护与促进。”","As he explains, ""textual incorporation cannot be adequately understood as “blank parody”. We need categories to add to pastiche, which demonstrate how contemporary pop opposes, celebrates and promotes the texts it steals from""."
10092,正因电视观众有能力将自己的日常生活与屏幕上那个德州豪门联系起来，我们才可言称《豪》剧体现了“情感现实主义”。,It is this ability to make our own lives connect with the lives of a family of Texan millionaires that gives the programme its emotional realism.
10092,也许我们并不是有钱人，但我们和剧中的富家子弟之间存在着共通之处:悲欢离合，生老病死，诸如此类。,"We may not be rich, but we may have other fundamental things in common: relationships and broken relationships, happiness and sadness, illness and health."
10092,那些认为该剧现实的观众，有的将注意力集中在叙事的独特性（“外延”）上，有的则关心剧情主题的普遍性（“内涵”）。,"Those who find it realistic shift the focus of attention from the particularity of the narrative (""denotation"") to the generality of its themes (""connotation"")."
10093,我们已经看到文化对新陈代谢的某个或某些需求的反应构成了一套制度。,We see already that the cultural response to the particular need or needs imposed by metabolism consists of a set of institutions.
10093,此处列举的制度往往并不是仅仅关乎营养而不及其他。,Few of the institutions here enumerated are exclusively concerned with nutrition alone.
10093,同时，正是家庭和家户的构造本身使得这种群体必然成为消费过程——往往也是食物制作过程——的主导场所。,"At the same time, the very constitution of the family and of the household makes it indispensable for this group to be the predominant setting for the processes of consumption, and as a rule, also of preparation of food."
10094,弗雷泽深深沉迷于对人类信仰和实践的心理学解释。,Frazer was essentially addicted to psychological interpretations of human belief and practice.
10094,他解释巫术是观念联想的结果。他对图腾起源提出的三个连续假说，即对“灵魂外在”、“巫术诱致生育”和“动物转世投胎”的信奉，基本是受到个体心理学的影响。,"His theory of magic, as the result of association of ideas; his three consecutive hypotheses about the origins of totemism in terms of belief in ""external soul,"" ""magical inducement of fertility,"" and in ""animal incarnation,"" are essentially conceived in terms of individual psychology."
10094,了解弗雷泽如何对待禁忌对待图腾制各方面，对待巫术、宗教和科学的人，都能看出弗雷泽在阐明其理论时几乎很少意识到社会心理学问题的存在。,"Those who know his treatment of taboo, of the various aspects of totemism, of the development of magic, religion and science, will realize that, throughout, Frazer in his explicit theories is little aware of the problems of social psychology."
10094,如同前述，他对心理分析怀有深刻敌意，而行为主义又从来没有进人他的话语体系。,"He is, as already mentioned, fundamentally hostile to psychoanalysis, while behaviorism never enters his universe of discourse."
10095,与植物一样，动物也经由选育良种而得到改良。而且除供给奶类和肉食、羊毛与皮革之外，某些动物还可以用作动力，如载重、牵犁和拉车。,"Animals, like plants, were improved through selective breeding, and, in addition to supplying milk, meat, wool, and hides, some species could be used as motive power, either to carry burdens or to draw plows or vehicles."
10095,所以，动物驯养大大提高了处于文化控制之下的，可为文化建设所利用的总能量。,The domestication of animals thus greatly increased the amount of energy under cultural control and available for culture building.
10096,武力可以经过其他从属集团的赞同而被用来反对某些从属集团，它们可能构成一种对压制的霸权式的使用。,Force can be used against certain subordinate groups with the consent of other subordinate groups: a presumably hegemonic use of coercion.
10096,同样地，国家机构可能用一种合法的或霸权的方式使用压制。,"Likewise, coercion can be used in a legitimate or hegemonic way by agencies of the state."
10096,此外，法西斯主义对暴力的赞美是压制性的还是霸权式的，抑或是这二者？,"Moreover, is the fascist celebration of violence coercive or hegemonic, or indeed both?"
10097,如果简单列举由生物要求的文化满足强加的衍生驱力，我们会看到器物的不断更新是一种必需，时部落经济体系则是对此的一种回应。,"If we were to enumerate briefly the derived imperatives imposed by the cultural satisfaction of biological needs,we would see that the constant renewal of apparatuses a necessity to which the economic system of a tribe is a response."
10097,另外，人类合作意味着权威、自然力或社会契约所认可的行为规范。,"Again, human cooperation implies norms of conduct sanctioned by authority, physical force, or social contract."
10097,这里，我们看到各种控制体系的回应，不论是原始的，还是发达的。,"Here we have the response of various systems of control, primitive or developed."
10097,每个复合制度和整个文化群体中的人事更新，不仅意味着生育繁衍，而且意味着教育体系。,"The renewal of the human personnel in every component institution, and in the cultural group as a whole, implies not only reproduction, but also systems of education."
10097,由权威和防卫所支持的强制和强迫的组织，其在功能上与每种制度内部的政治组织，进而又与特定的群体相关。我们把这种群众定义为政治单位，或政治国家的原塑。,"The organization of force and compulsion in the support of authority and defence is functionally related to the political organization within each institution and also later on in specific groupings, which we have defined as political units, or the prototype of the political state."
10098,若想对“自然而然的”性别和异性恋霸权的虚构意识形态展开讨论，最佳方式莫过于从酷儿理论的奠基之著——茱迪丝•巴特勒那部影响深远的《性别麻烦》——入手。,"To discuss the supposed naturalness of gender and the ideological fictions supporting compulsory heterosexuality, there is no better place to begin than with one of the founding texts of queer theory, Judith Butler’s very influential book Gender Trouble."
10098,"巴特勒首先援引西蒙娜•德•波伏娃的名言：“女人并非生为女人，而是后天变成女人的。""","Butler begins from Simone de Beauvoir’s observation that‘one is not born a woman, but, rather, becomes one’."
10099,那种以为只要人获得了正确的信条，就能将自己的意志施加于自然界，同样也施加于人类的信念，曾经作为巫术在原始社会中繁花盛开。,The belief that man can work his will upon natureand man alike if only he had the light formulas once flourished in primitive society as magic.
10099,今天，我们仍然持有这种看法。但我们眼下称其为科学。,"It is still with us today, but we now call it Science."
10100,布尔迪厄的目标并不在于证实那些“不言自明”的东西。不同的阶级固然拥有不同的生活方式和不同的文化品位，怛更重要的是文化区隔的构成如何维系权力与控制的形态并将其合法化。这一切都深深根植于经济的不平等。,"Bourdieu's purpose is not to prove the self-evident, that different classes have different lifestyles, different tastes in culture, but to identify and interrogate the processes by which the making of cultural distinctions secures and legitimates forms of power and control rooted in economic inequalities."
10100,布尔迪厄对业已存在的差异不感兴趣，而更关注统治阶级如何利用差异来进行社会再生产。,"He is interested not so much in the actual differences, but in how these differences are used by dominant groups as a means of social reproduction."
10101,关于后现代主义的种种争论……可被解读为大众文化开始“大举进攻”的标志。至此，大众文化的美学及其包孕的潜能迅速攻陷了特权者的领土。,"The debate over postmodernism can...be read as the symptom of the disruptive ingression of popular culture, its aesthetics and intimate possibilities, into a previously privileged domain."
10101,文化产品与知识的大众化网络既粗狂又凌乱，却对科学理论与学术话语构成了尖锐的挑战。,"Theory and academic discourses are confronted by the wider, unsystemized, popular networks of cultural production and knowledge."
10101,知识分子诠释知识、传播知识的特权地位岌岌可危，其权威性亦遭遇重新洗牌。,"The intellectual’s privilege to explain and distribute knowledge is threatened; his authority, for it is invariably ‘his’, redimensionalized."
10102,我们此前提到过，“dog”这个能指对应着“狗（四足犬科动物）”这个所指。,"As we noted earlier, the signifier ""dog"" produces the signified ""dog"": a four-legged canine creature."
10102,巴尔特指出，这只不过是初级指意系统。,Barthes argues that this indicates only primary signification.
10102,在此系统中生成的符号“狗”（包括了能指和所指）又变成了次级指意系统中的能指；在次级指意系统中，“狗”这个能指又指向新的所指，那就是“一个招人讨厌的人”。,"The sign ""dog"" produced at the primary level of signification is available to become the signifier ""dog"" at a second level of signification.This may then produce at the secondary level the signified ""dog"": an unpleasant human being."
10103,人类生物学从未将人类划分为不同的“种族”，只有种族主义（以及反种族主义）才坚持强调人种间的差异。,"Human biology does not divide people into different ""races""; it is racism (and sometimes its counter arguments) that insists on this division."
10103,换言之，“种族”乃是一个文化与历史的范畴，是依肤色不同而制造指意差异的机制。,"In other words, ""race"" is a cultural and historical category, a way of making difference signify between people of a variety of skin tones."
10103,关键之处并不在于肤色差异本身，而在于这种差异如何被用来指意，以及按照社会与政治的等级制度通过何种方式让差异变得有意义。,"What is important is not difference as such, but how it is made to signify; how it is made meaningful in terms of a social and political hierarchy."
10104,根据巴特的观点，资产阶级意识形态的特征是要否认资产阶级的存在。,"According to Barthes, bourgeois ideology characteristically denies the existence of a bourgeois class."
10104,他写道：“作为一种意识形态事实，它完全消失了：资产阶级已把它的名字顺便从现实到表现、从经济上的人到心理上的人抹掉了”。,"He writes: ""as an ideological fact, it completely disappears: the bourgeoisie has obliterated its name in passing from reality to representation, from economic man to mental man""."
10104,这是一个没有名字的阶级，因为神话起到了意识形态的作用以确保它不被命名。,This is a class with no name because myth functions as ideology to ensure that it is not named.
10105,人们划清了主体与客体的区别。,
10105,,The distinction between subject and object was made.
10105,然而为自然主义而进行的斗争尚未获得全胜。,But the fight for naturalism has not been wholly won yet.
10105,在许多领域之中，精神活动仍被成为“人类的心灵”，甚至在今天，在心理学，社会学和人类学中，灵魂与精神仍然是形影不离的。,"Mental life is still called ""the human spirit"" in many circles, and the soul and mind still walk hand in hand in psychologies, sociologies, and anthropologies even today."
10106,弗洛伊德用一个人骑马的例子来描述本我与自我的关系：“马是最主要的动力源，而骑马的人则决定了前进的目标并控制着马的活动。但是，正如马不可能在一切情况下都听任人的摆布一样，我们也不能确保自我能够随时随地保持对本我的控制。,"Freud compares the relationship between the id and the ego as similar to a person riding a horse: ‘The horse supplies the locomotive energy, while the rider has the privilege of deciding on the goal and of guiding the powerful animal’s movement. But only too often there arises between the ego and the id the not precisely ideal situation of the rider being obliged to guide the horse along the path by which it itself wants to go’ (109–10)."
10106,”事实，在自我头上总共有三个“主子”，分别是“外部世界”、“本我的力比多”以及“超我的严厉性”。,"In fact, the ego struggles to serve three masters, the ‘external world’, the ‘libido of the id’, and the ‘severity of the super-ego’ (1984: 397)."
