Type A personality is characterized by chronic feelings of a sense of time urgency, an excessive competitive drive, and difficulty accepting and enjoying leisure time. 
The opposite of Type A is Type B personality. 
Type Bs don’t suffer from time urgency or impatience. 
Until quite recently, it was believed that Type As were more likely to experience stress on and off the job.
