During the initial contact stage, the union determines the employees interest in organizing, and establishes an organizing committee. 
The initiative for the first contact between the employees and the union may come from the employees, from a union already representing other employees of the firm, or from a union representing workers elsewhere. 
In any case, there is an initial contact.
