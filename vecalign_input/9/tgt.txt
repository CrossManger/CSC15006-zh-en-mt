Imai (1986) supports the continuous improvement process, whereby people are encouraged to focus on the environment in which they work rather than on the results. 
He believes that by continually improving processes and systems, the end result will be a better product or service. 
This has become known as the "R" or process approach, rather than the "R," or results approach of Frederick Taylor, a pioneer in work measurement and the father of industrial management. 
The process approach is also known as the Kaizen approach.
