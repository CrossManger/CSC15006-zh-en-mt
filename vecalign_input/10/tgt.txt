A PERT network is a flowchart diagram that depicts the sequence of activities needed to complete a project and the time or costs associated with each activity. 
With a PERT network, a manager must think through what has to be done, determine which events depend on one another, and identify potential trouble spots. 
PERT also makes it easy to compare the effects alternative actions might have on scheduling and costs. 
Thus, PERT allows managers to monitor a project’s progress, identify possible bottlenecks, and shift resources as necessary to keep the project on schedule.
