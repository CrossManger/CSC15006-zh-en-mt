Performance analysis is the process of verifying that there is a performance deficiency and determining whether the employer should correct such deficiencies through training or some other means (like transferring the employee). 
The first step in performance analysis is usually to compare the person s actual performance to what it should be. 
Doing so helps to confirm that there is a performance deficiency, and (hopefully) helps the manager to identify its cause.
