    "output": "During the initial contact stage, the union determines the employees interest in organizing, and establishes an organizing committee. The initiative for the first contact between the employees and the union may come from the employees, from a union already representing other employees of the firm, or from a union representing workers elsewhere. In any case, there is an initial contact.\n",

    "input": "工作绩效分析是指核验当前工作绩效与要求的工作绩效之间的差距，并确定是应当通过培训来纠正这种差距，还是应通过其他方式（如更换机器或调动雇员）来纠正。第一步是要评价雇员的工作绩效。换句话说，就是要改进雇员的工作绩效。你必须先确定你希望这个雇员的工作绩效是什么样的，而目前他的工作绩效又是什么样的。\n",
    "output": "Performance analysis is the process of verifying that there is a performance deficiency and determining whether the employer should correct such deficiencies through training or some other means (like transferring the employee). The first step in performance analysis is usually to compare the person s actual performance to what it should be. Doing so helps to confirm that there is a performance deficiency, and (hopefully) helps the manager to identify its cause.\n",

Chance events are developments outside the control of firms (and usually the nation’s government), such as pure inventions, breakthroughs in basic technologies, wars, external political developments, and major shifts in foreign market demand.They create discontinuities that can unfreeze or reshape industry structure and provide the opportunity for one nation’s firms to supplant another’s.\n",

    "output": "A PERT network is a flowchart diagram that depicts the sequence of activities needed to complete a project and the time or costs associated with each activity. With a PERT network, a manager must think through what has to be done, determine which events depend on one another, and identify potential trouble spots. PERT also makes it easy to compare the effects alternative actions might have on scheduling and costs. Thus, PERT allows managers to monitor a project’s progress, identify possible bottlenecks, and shift resources as necessary to keep the project on schedule.\n",
