4043,在新全球经济的精英和“知识工人”中间，已经产生出默示的跨国“阶级”忠诚。这种忠诚由于在意识形态上亲近新自由主义正统经济理论而得到巩固。,"Among the elites and ""knowledge workers"" of the new global economy tacit transnational ""class"" allegiances have evolved, cemented by an ideological attachment to a neoliberal economic orthodoxy."
4043,对于那些现在处于边缘的人来说，消费主义意识形态在全世界的扩散也强加给他们一种新的认同感，替代了传统文化和生活方式。,"For those who are currently marginalized, the worldwide diffusion of a consumerist ideology also imposes a new sense of identity, displacing traditional cultures and ways of life."
4043,自由民主在全球的扩展进一步强化了正在出现一种全球文明的感觉，这种文明的标志是经济政治组织的普遍标准。,The global spread of liberal democracy further reinforces the sense of an emerging global civilization defined by universal standards of economic and political organization.
4044,"最近关于世界体系和文明互动模式的历史研究对一个被普遍接受的观点提出了质疑。这个观点认为全球化首先是现代的现象（McNeill, 1995; Roudometof 和 Robertson, 1995; Bentley, 1996; Frank 和 Gills, 1996），中世纪出现的世界宗教和贸易网络便人们对这样一种观点更加敏感，它认为全球化是一个历史悠久的过程。","Recent historical studies of world systems and of patterns of civilizational interaction bring into question the commonly accepted view that globalization is primarily a phenomenon of the modern age (McNeill, 1995; Roudometof and Robertson, 1995; Bentley, 1996; Frank and Gills, 1996).The existence of world religions and the trade networks of the medieval era encourage a greater sensitivity to the idea that globalization is a process which has a long history."
4044,这意味着要解释当代全球化的全新特征，需要使视野超越现代。,This implies the need to look beyond the modern era in any attempt to offer an explanation of the novel features of contemporary globalization.
4045,总的说来，在当时，宗族和父系家族是中国社会上下层之间联系的唯一主要的纽带。,"By and large then, the clan and patrilineal lineage emerge as the only important link between the upper and lower strata in Chinese society."
4045,正因如此，它们的重要性不能低估。虽然象我们以后将要说到的，宗族还是起着双重的作用：它作为重要的工具使叛乱分子集合在了一起。,"As such their importance should not be underestimated, though, as will appear in due course, the clan was double edged: it could also serve as the key mechanism holding rebellious groups together."
4046,海因里希•希姆莱和党卫军是阿道夫•希特勒的种族主义意识形态的忠实信奉者。,Heinrich Himmler and the SS organization shared Adolf Hitler’s racial ideology.
4046,党卫军肩负着纳粹党所称的最终解决犹太问题的责任，这就是，要彻底消灭犹太人。,"The SS was given responsibility for what the Nazis called their Final Solution to the Jewish problem, the annihilation of the Jews."
4046,莱因哈特•海因里希(1904-1942)是党卫军安全部门的首领，他受命负责最终解决的具体实施。,"Reinhard Heydrich (1904--1942), head of the SS’s Security Service, was given administrative responsibility for the Final Solution."
4046,在波兰被击败之后，海因里希命令他组建的党卫军持别行动队将所有的波兰犹太人都围捕起来，并将其集中在若干个城市中的犹太人区中。,"After the defeat of Poland, Heydrich ordered the special strike forces (Einsatzgruppen) that he had created to round up all Polish Jews and concentrate them in ghettos established in a number of Polish cities."
4047,反过来，这改变着全球体系内军事技术权力的分层。,This in turn is transforming the stratification of military-technological power within the global system.
4047,因为这些处于商业技术革新前沿的国家和公司不再完全等同于现在的军事强国和军事工业公司。,For the cohort of states and corporations at the leading edge of commercial technological innovation is no longer entirely synonymous with the cohort of today's great military powers or military-industrial corporations.
4047,从这个方面来看，我们应当从下面这个事实受到启发：在1989年，美国38%的军事半导体是进口的，五角大楼“如果没有3家日本公司的帮助，无法将其导弹和飞机升入天空，因为这3家公司提供了95%的陶瓷管壳来保护其电子”（OAT，1991，第38页；Economist Intelligence Unit，1994，第18页）。,"In this respect, it is instructive to note that in 1989 38 per cent of US military semiconductors were imported while the Pentagon 'cannot put a single missile or aircraft up in the sky without the help of three Japanese companies that provide 95 per cent of the ceramic packages that protect their electronics' (OTA, 1991, p. 38; Economist Intelligence Unit, 1994, p. 18)."
4048,但是，与美国的联盟关系继续制约着日本生产什么以及怎样生产，并且也制约着日本更全面的防卫立场。,"The alliance relationship with the US, however, continues to constrain both how and what Japan produces as well as its more general defence posture."
4048,因此，三菱公司与标准动力公司之间的 “日-美先进战机”（FSX）合作的提高部分原因是，美国害怕日本独立发展驱逐舰的能力。,Thus the FSX fighter collaboration between Mitsubishi and General Dynamics arose in part because of US fears of an indigenous independent fighter capability in Japan.
4048,武器出口贸易为日本宪法第九款所禁止，但它不适用于与防卫相关的两用设备。,"Arms exports remain prohibited by Article 9 of the Japanese constitution, but this does not apply to defence-related dual-use equipment."
4049,"在1851年的万国工业博览会之后，英国获得了恩菲尔德军械厂（待建中）所需的美国先进的生产技术和机器设备，到1863年，它每年生产10.37万支来福枪 (McNeill, 1982，第233页-235页）。","Following the Great Exhibition in 1851, Britain acquired American advanced production techniques and machinery specifically for the (yet to be constructed) Enfield armoury and by 1863 it was producing 100,370 rifles per annum (McNeill, 1982, pp. 233-5)."
4049,到1870年欧洲的其他国家也达到了这个水平。,By 1870 the rest of Europe was doing the same.
4049,工业资本主义正促进着军事生产能力和与军事相关的技术的大幅扩散与传播。,Industrial capitalism was contributing to a significant diffusion of military productive capability as well as military-related technology.
4050,北宋建立后为了加强对地方的控制，改变唐末以来地方权力过大的现状，对地方体制进行了变动。,"The local government had more and more power since late Tang Dynasty.In order to change this situation and keep control over the local government, rulers of Northern Song Dynasty made great changes to the local administrative system."
4050,"逐步取消节度使的财政、军事、司法权力，同时在地方采取中央派出机构来管理地方的模式，将全国划分为若干路，形成了以转运使司、提点刑狱司、提举常平司、安抚使司为主的路级机构，除安抚使由所在路的首州知州兼任外，其他三司号称""监司""，作为中央的派出机构，代表中央管理地方，加强了中央对地方的控制。","As a result, Jiedushi\'s power in finance, military affairs and judicature was weakened."
4050,在中国地方行政机构从二级制向三级制的转变中起着承上启下的作用。,"At the same time, a new government system was set up, according to which the whole country was divided into a number of lu\'s, and each was to be administered by a zhuanyunshisi, a tidianxingyushi, a tijuchangpingshi and an anfushi (or pacifier)."
4051,"""八纮""一词原出自我国古籍，意指四方四隅。","The term ""eight directions"" originates from Chinese ancient books, meaning ""eight crown cords""."
4051,在日本则出自《日本书记》。,"In Japan, it comes from the chronicle ‘Nihon Shoki'."
4051,"在所谓神武天皇建都诏书中说:""兼六合以开都，掩八纮而为宇""。","The edict of the Emperor Jimmu reads: ""Hakkō wo ooute ie to nasan""."
4051,"1903年田中智学把这句话概括为""八纮一宇""，字面上与""四海一家""同义，实则要求由日本独霸全世界。","In 1903, Tanaka Zhixue summarized this sentence as ""Hakkō Ichiu"", literally synonymous with ""Four Seas and One Family"".In fact, it requires Japan to dominate the world."
4051,"1940年7月26日，日本内阁在其《基本国策要纲》中正式写道:""皇国之国策乃基于八纮一宇之肇国伟大精神""。","On July 26, 1940, the Japanese Cabinet officially wrote in its Outline of Basic National Policy says, ""The national policy of the imperial state is based on the great spirit of the founding of Hakkō Ichiu the country of Bakaniyu""."
4052,西汉八校尉是指武帝在京师长安设置的中垒、屯骑、步兵、越骑、长水、胡骑、射声、虎贲八个校尉。,"The Eight Xiaowei in the Western Han Dynasty refers to the eight official titles, named and established by Emperor Wu in the capital of Chang\'an, including Zhonglei, Tunqi, Bubing, Yueqi, Changshui, Huqi, Shesheng and Huben."
4052,古今众多学者认为中垒校尉统领其他七校，且这八校尉及其所率军队均属北军范围。,Many scholars from ancient times to the present hold that these eight officers as well as their troops belong to the North Army with Zhonglei as the general leader.
4052,然在汉代史籍中，仅见中垒校尉掌北军营垒内军务的相关记载，尚未发现其统领其他七校尉的确凿证据。,"But, the historical records of the Han Dynasty only shows that Zhonglei undertakes some military affairs of the North Army, and there is no evidence showing Zhonglei as the general leader of other seven Xiaowei."
4052,此外，无论是从组织系统、驻军地点，还是建军意图方面分析，中垒校尉以外的七个校尉都不在北军之列。,"Furthermore, judging either from the organizational system and the garrison location, or from the analysis of the intention of establishing the army, it is clear that the other seven Xiaowei are not in the rank of North Army."
4053,巴蜀文化应该有狭义与广义之分。,The Ba-Shu Culture can be understood in different senses.
4053,狭义的巴蜀文化，即中国西南地区以古代巴、蜀为主的族群的先民们留下的文化遗产，主要分布在四川盆地及其邻近地区，其时代大约相当于春秋战国秦汉时期，前后延续上千年。,"In a narrow sense it refers to the cultural inheritance left by the people of the Ba and Shu ethnic groups, who lived in the southwest of China, especially in Sichuan Basin and its neighbourhood.This culture went on for nearly a thousand years, presumably from the Spring and Autumn Period to the Han Dynasty."
4053,从考古学上确认巴蜀诸族群的文化和巴蜀文化区，是建国以来两周考古的一大收获。广义的巴蜀文化是指包括四川省与重庆市两者及邻近地域在内的、以历史悠久的巴文化和蜀文化为主体的、包括地域内各少数民族文化在内的、由古至今的地区文化的总汇。,"It is a great achievement in the Western and Eastern Zhou Dynasty archaeology to confirming the culture of Ba-Shu ethnic group and determining a special Ba-Shu Cultural area.The Ba-Shu Culture in a broad sense means a hybrid from then on, which has the Ba-Shu Culture as a backbone and includes some minority cultures in Sichuan province, Chongqing and their adjacent regions."
4054,荀子关于大一统王权政治的构想反映了儒家学说为适应战国末期的社会转型而发生的理论变迁。,Xunzi's blueprint of great-unity royal politics reveals the theoretical change of Confucianism to meet the social transformation of the late Warring States period.
4054,荀子提出了礼法互补、王政霸政并用的系统理论，为大一统王权政治提供了最佳的治国模式。,"He advocated the systematic theory of the complementarity of virtue and law and the combination of royal government and lord politics in Spring and Autumn Period, and thus proposed the best model of state governance for great-unity royal politics."
4054,关于大一统王权政治的制度建设，荀子论述了他的王政和王制的思想。,"For the systemic construction of the theory, Xunzi described his idea of royal politics and royal system."
4054,荀子主张尊君，以树立和维护君主的权威，同时又主张以儒家的道统与民本思想为主，建立起对君主的权力与意志的制约机制。,"He advocated great respect for rulers to keep their authority.On the other hand, he advocated a mechanism of restraining ruler power and will, while using the ideas of the Confucian Way and the people as the root."
4055,入清以来，土默特地区的移民问题备受史学界关注，成为土默特地区社会生活史研究中的重要问题之一。,"As a key subject in studies of Tümed's social life history, the immigration of Tümed area in the Qing Dynasty draws close attention of historians."
4055,这一移民现象清以降由于其特定的时间和空间要素发生了深刻的变化。,The migration has undergone profound changes during and after the Qing Dynasty because of its specific elements of time and space.
4055,尽管其承袭明朝“板升”移民的历史，但是从类型、方式、构成、数量、影响等方面都表现出新时期、新阶段的移民特性。,"Although it inherited the history of ""Baixing"" immigration in the Ming Dynasty, it has shown features of immigration in a new era and at a new stage in terms of type, fashion, composition, quantity, impact, etc."
4056,唐代刺史（或称部刺史、州刺史）最重要的使命，无疑是监督州内的税赋并上缴。,The primary duty of the Prefectural Governor in the Tang Dynasty was to supervise the collection of tax in this prefecture and turn in these tax to upper authority.
4056,简单说，唐刺史本质上就是州最高一级的“收税官”，跟罗马帝国时代的总督也主掌收税类似。,"Simply put, it served as a Prefecture-level tax collector, just like the provincial governor in the Roman Empire."
4056,刺史的年终考课，基本上以他的税收业绩为依据。,The annual assessment of the Prefectural Governor was largely based upon the tax revenue he brought in.
4057,公元992年，丁谓通过科举考试，成为饶州的财务总司。,"In 992, Ding Wei passed the imperial examination and became the financial controller-general of Raozhou."
4057,一年后，他陪同太子赵元侃视察福建。,"A year later, he accompanied the crown prince Zhao Yuankan to inspect Fujian."
4057,回来后，他呈上了一份关于盐茶的报告，并被任命为支度使。,"Upon his return, he presented a report on salt and tea, and was made a fiscal commissioner."
4058,火药和指南针发明后，国人既用于爆竹神鬼、堪舆风水，也用于兵器战争、航海指向。,"Soon after the powder and compass were invented, the Chinese people used the powder for making crackers exorcising demons, and used the compass for geomancy and fengshui.Meanwhile, they also used these in making weapons for wars and navigation."
4058,在郑和下西洋的壮举中，火器已是远洋海船的主要武器装备之一，指南针也是最主要的导航指向仪器。,"When Zheng He led his fleet to the then-called Western Oceans during the early 15th century, firearms had been one of the main weaponries of the oceangoing ships and the compass was used as the major instrument for voyage guiding."
4058,那种认为在中国古代火药长期主要只用于烟花爆竹、指南针到下西洋时仍只是辅助导航仪器的观点是不符合历史实际的。,These facts are contrary to the viewpoint that the powder was used only for fireworks and the compass was used only as auxiliary tools even by Zheng He's time.
4059,如果按照户均5口计算，那么元代江西地区约有12396890口。,"Assuming that there were 5 people on average in each family, approximately 12,396,890 people inhabited Jiangxi in the Yuan Dynasty."
4059,至于诸色户计制度，据史料载，元代江西地区除了民户外，还有大量的其他户计存在。,"As to the occupation registry system, there were other kinds of families besides those engaged in farmer's trade in Jiangxi Province in the Yuan Dynasty according to historical data."
4059,总体上来说，诸色户计制度较为完备。,"Overall, the occupation registry system was comparably complete."
4060,贾谊提出众建诸侯的建议为文帝所采纳，并对后来晁错和主父偃很有启发。,"Jia Yi puts forth the proposal of establishing the system of feudal lords, which is adopted by Emperor Wen and further inspires Chao Cuo and Zhufu Yan."
4060,消除边患是贾谊治国方略之一。,Eliminating border unrests is also one of Jia Yi's tactics of administering the country.
4060,对于匈奴侵扰，文帝和景帝采取和、战结合，武帝则是先和后战，不同做法与贾谊方案是一致的。,"The different measures taken by Emperor Wen, Emperor Jing and Emperor Wu to resist the aggressions of Xiongnu are actually in accordance with Jia Yi's scheme."
4060,重视经济是贾谊思想的重要内容。,Emphasizing economy is also an important part of Jia Yi's thought.
4060,由于这样思想主张得到实行，文景之治带来经济的发展。,The fact that this idea has been effectively put into practice greatly stimulates the economic development in the regime of Emperor Wen and Emperor Jing.
4060,武帝时币制改革，事实上也是贾谊思想在政策方面的实现。,The reform of the currency system during Emperor Wu's regime also reveals Jia Yi's thought concerning national policy.
4061,转运司设置于五代时期。,The Transport Department was set up in the Five Dynasties period.
4061,其主管官吏称转运使，始见于唐。,The officials in charge of the Transport Department first appeared in the Tang Dynasty.
4061,转运司的权力在宋代发展至顶峰，兼管民事、司法、监察、财政及军事等职。,"The title reached the height of its power in the Song Dynasty, which covered responsibilities for the civil, judicial, supervising, financial and military affairs, and so on."
4061,至元代，转运司开始走向下坡路，权力范围明显缩小，只负责财政事务，如催征赋税、办理上供、转输物资等。,"Later in the Yuan Dynasty, the Transport Department's duty was reduced to only the financial affairs, such as pressing and imposing the taxes, and transporting the goods and materials."
4062,南外宗正司是宋代管理外居宗室的机构。宋金交战，为躲避战乱，它辗转迁入福建泉州。,"In order to avoid the war between the Song Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty, the organization to manage the Zhao Imperial Clan moved into Fujian."
4062,南外宗正司的机构非常健全，宗室在闽蓬勃发展。,"The organization was very effective, and the Zhao Imperial Clan developed quickly."
4062,南外宗正司的入闽，对提高泉州乃至福建的历史地位以及促进福建经济文化的繁荣均有深远的影响。,"This organization made such positive influences as improving the historical position of Quanzhou and Fujian, and promoting the prosperity of the economy and culture of Fujian."
4063,晋北的雁门、宁武、偏头三关一带在明代属边关要地。,"The three districts—Yanmen, Ningwu and Piantou—were important border regions in the Ming Dynasty."
4063,明中后期，大同总兵在边关地区大肆伐木，引发了山西巡抚与大同总兵之间多次的伐木纠纷。,"In the middle and later Ming Dynasty, the commander-in-chief of Datong cut down a lot of trees in the border regions, triggering repeated logging disputes between the provincial governor of Shanxi and him."
4063,纠纷显示，明初三关一带森林广布，较大的树木多是全新世温暖期森林的遗存，森林和地形结合构成天然军事防御体系是抵御北方游牧骑兵的屏障，但却无资料显示明代人已认识到生态保护的价值。,"The disputes showed that there were extensive forests with large trees remaining in existence since the Holocene Warm Period, and that the combination of forestry and topography was a natural military defense system, which could help withstand the nomadic cavalry from the north.Yet no data displayed that people in the Ming Dynasty were aware of ecological protection."
4064,双城总管府是蒙古在高丽东北部地区设立的统治机构，一直存在到元末。,"Shuangcheng Zongguanfu was the ruling office in the northeast of Korea, which was established by the Mongol Empire and existed to the last years of the Yuan Dynasty."
4064,双城总管府主要由归降蒙古的高丽人世袭管领，元廷派达鲁花赤进行监临控制。,"It was mainly ruled by the Koreans hereditarily who pledged allegiance to the Yuan Dynasty.At the same time, the Yuan Dynasty sent supervisors to control it."
4064,双城总管府的设立对元丽政治关系产生了深远的影响。,The establishment of Shuangcheng Zongguanfu greatly influenced the China-Korea relations during the Yuan Dynasty.
4065,对于清初江南奏销案，一般论者大多从清廷对士绅的政策层面着眼。,"For the case of financial receipts and expenditures reporting in Jiangnan Province in the early Qing Dynasty, scholars generally study it from the angle of the policy of the Qing Government to the gentries."
4065,江南奏销案并不是一个孤立的事件，清廷之所以在全国范围内发动奏销案，是因为清初财政肩负双重使命，这种双重使命导致国家异常重视财政制度的完善和执行。,"However, it was not an isolated event.The Qing Government started it all over the nation because the finance of the government shouldered the dual mission in the special social situation in the early Qing Dynasty, and this made it necessary for the nation to put exceptional emphasis on the perfection and execution of the financial system."
4065,江南奏销案对绅士的打击比较广泛是江南特殊的情形使然。,Therefore the special situation in Jiangnan Province caused the broad attack on the gentries.
4066,奏折制度起源于顺治时期，其原始形态是皇室戚属致送皇帝及皇太后之请安折。,"It was verified that the system of memorials to the throne began in the Shunzhi period, and the original memorials, sent by members of the royal clan, were aimed at paying respects to the Emperor and the Empress Dowager."
4066,康熙间，奏折使用范围扩及内外臣工，内容也改以政事为主。与之同时，在上行文书中的地位和作用也日益重要。,"The ministers and officers began to use memorials to talk about political matters in the Kangxi period, and the memorials became more and more important."
4066,作为奏折原始形态的继承，康熙朝诸皇子奏折亦呈现过渡状态。,"Through a succession of the earliest memorials, those of the princes of Kangxi also had a development period."
4066,这些变化，对于当时政局和此后奏折发展方向，都产生了重要而深远的影响。,All of these changes had made important and extensive influences on the political situation and the later style of memorials to the throne.
4067,清中后期没有制定统一的租佃法律。,"In the late Qing Dynasty, the Qing government did not make the uniform tenancy law."
4067,因此，各政府制定租佃政策以弥补法律不足，其中以陕南与苏南为代表，但两者制定的政策在价值取向与具体内容上，有诸多不同。,"Therefore, the local governments'policies could make up for the lack of such a law.The South of Shanxi and South of Jiangsu governments were the representatives.However, there were many differences in their value orientation and specific contents."
4067,陕南地方政府租佃政策平衡地主与佃农关系，取得了良好效果，缓和租佃关系，促进了农业生产；苏南地方政府租佃政策压制佃农的合理诉求，不能缓解租佃矛盾，无法取得良好效果。,"The former balanced the relationship and achieved good results, and eased the tenant-landlord relations and promoted agricultural production.In comparison, the latter did not cater to the reasonable requests of the tenants, was unable to achieve good effects, and could not ease the tenant-landlord conflicts and retain a good social order."
4068,族刑是一种基于血缘关系的家族集体性惩罚，主要适用于政治性犯罪。,"Family punishment was a form of collective punishment based on kinship, and it was mainly applicable to political crimes."
4068,秦汉时期族诛的范围基本上是“父母妻子同产”，仅在特殊情况下有小范围伸缩。,"Except for a small number of variances, the collective death penalty was meted out basically to ""parents, wives and off-springs"" of the accused during the Qin and Han Dynasties."
4068,大约以宣元时期为界，族刑的施刑方式渐由诛杀向诛徙转变。,"Starting approximately from the reign of Emperor Xuanyuan, the family punishment gradually changed from that of killing to banishment."
4068,家族主义为族刑的存在提供了条件。族刑是古代小政府控制大国土的有效有段，并且可以提高刑罚上限，增强刑罚的威慑力。,"The clan system provided the necessary conditions for collective punishment, which constituted an effective mechanism of small governments controlling a large state.It set up an upper limit of punishment while greatly enhancing the deterrent power of punishments."
4069,先秦时期左史与右史的职位是否存在？“左史记言，右史记事”还是“左史记事，右史记言”？这两个问题一直是争论不休的话题。,"The issues have been a topic of debate for a long time whether official positions like left history official and right history official really existed in the early Qin period, and which position was in charge of recording historical events or remarks."
4069,从文献资料和甲骨卜辞的记载看，左史、右史的职位是存在的，只是随着人们尚右、尚左观念的发展变化，其地位有轻重之分。,"According to the records and oracle inscriptions, the positions of left and right history officials did exist.But with people's changing ideas of esteem preference on the left or the right, the two official positions had different significances at different times."
4069,而记言、记事只是当时史官众多职能中的一项，实则左史、右史皆可为之。,"In the early Qin period, recording historical remarks and events was only part of responsibilities of historians, and both the left and the right history official could do it."
4070,座上奴是一种越南皇帝蓄养的奴隶，存在于越南的陈朝。,"：Zuoshangnu was a kind of slaves who were kept by the Emperor of Vietnam, which existed in the Chen Dynasty in Vietnam."
4070,他们要在脸上刺上“座上奴”三个字来表明自己的身份，并与其他类型的奴隶、如公侯蓄养的官中客区分开来。,"The slaves had to have the words ""zuoshangnu"" tattooed on their faces to show their identity and to ditinguish themselves from other kinds of slaves, like guanzhongke, who were kept by baronage."
4070,同时，这种做法也可以防止他们逃亡。,"For another point, this could also prevent them from escaping."
4070,这种制度是越南奴隶制度残存的一种反映。,This system was a reflection of the remnants of slavery in Vietnam.
4071,尽管加尔文强调不可能有绝对的救赎，但是他的一些追随者并未能区分开这一点。,"Although Calvin stressed that there could be no absolute certainty of salvation, some of his followers did not always make this distinction."
4071,宿命论的实际心理后果是，给后来的加尔文教以一种不可动摇的信念，即他们在世间从事着上帝的事业。,The practical psychological effect of predestination was to give some later Calvinists an unshakable conviction that they were doing God’s work on earth.
4071,这样，加尔文教成为一种动态和积极的信念。,Thus Calvinism became a dynamic and activist faith.
4071,难怪加尔文教成为新教当中一种颇为好斗的跨国形式。,It is no accident that Calvinism became the militant international form of Protestantism.
4072,爱因斯坦后来对一位记者做了简单解释：“以前曾经认为，假如宇宙中所有的物质都消失了，时间和空间却还是存在的。然而，依照相对论来看，时间和空间会与物质一同消失。,"As Einstein later explained simply to a journalist, ""It was formerly believed that if all material things disappeared out of the universe, time and space would be left. According to the relativity theory, however, time and space disappear together with the things."""
4072,”此外，爱因斯坦还提出，物质不是什么别的东西，仅仅是能量的另一种形式。,"Moreover, Einstein concluded that matter was nothing but another form of energy."
4072,他的划时代的方程式E=mc2——每一个物质粒子的能量都相当于它的质量乘以光速的平方——是解释原子内部所蕴藏的巨大的能量的关键理论。,His epochal formula E=mc2---each particle of matter is equivalent to its mass times the square of the velocity of light---was the key to explaining the vast energies contained within the atom.
4072,它引领我们走向了原子时代。,It led to the atomic age.
4073,座落在这个几英亩圣地上面的是金字形神塔，塔的顶部是为祭祀掌管这个城市神灵而修筑的神庙。,"Occupying several acres, this sacred area consisted of a ziggurat with a temple at the top dedicated to the god or goddess who owned the city."
4073,而这个神庙就是这个共同体的真正中心。,The temple complex was the true center of the community.
4073,为主神塑造雕像并举行包括让神灵附身的祭祀仪式，以此象征主神居于此地，这样就给城市赋予了神的权力。,"The main god or goddess dwelt there symbolically in the form of a statue, and the ceremony of dedication included a ritual that linked the statue to the god or goddess and thus supposedly harnessed the power of the deity for the city’s benefit."
4074,在这方面，一个更有说服力的例子是在当代的国际法中，牢固地树立一个合法的国家必须是维护某些共同的民主价值的国家这一观念的倾向（参见Crawford和Marks， 1998）。,"A further telling example in this regard is the tendency in contemporary international law to entrench the notion that a legitimate state must be a state that upholds certain common democratic values (see Crawford and Marks, 1998)."
4074,例如，《世界人权宣言》第21条宣称，民主原则与某些列举出的权利一起作为一种“所有人民和国家追求的共同标准”（参见UN， 1988，第2、5页）。,"For instance, in Article 21 the ""Universal Declaration of Human Rights"" asserts the democratic principle along with enumerated rights as a ‘common standard of achievement for all peoples and nations’（see UN, 1988, pp. 2, 5)."
4074,但是，“民主” 一词却并未出现在《宣言》中，并且形容同“民主的”也只出现了一次（在第29条）。,"However, the word ‘democracy’ does not itself appear in the Declaration and the adjective ‘democratic’ appears again only once (in Article 29)."
4074,相反，《联合国公民权利和政治权利国际公约》（1966，1976年开始实行）在第25条里详尽地阐述了这一原则，使很多不同的权利协议与协定形成一个有约束力的条约（参见UN， I988，第28页）。,"By contrast, the ""UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights"" (1966) (which came into force in 1976) elaborates this principle in Article 25, making a number of different rights agreements and conventions into a binding treaty (see UN, 1988, p. 28)."
4075,《社会发展纲要》的思想前提和制度前提，同马克思主义的社会主义毫无关系。,"The intellectual and institutional antecedents of the ""Community Development Program"" do not have the remotest connection with Marxist socialism."
4075,而纲要中一个重要的因素是，甘地坚信理想化的印度村社是最适合文明人生活的社会共同体；第二个因素是英国 人的经验及其农业所不断发挥的作用；第三个因素是英国家长式统治的影响。,One important ingredient is Gandhi’s faith in an idealized version of the Indian village as the most suitable community for civilized man.A second element is American experience with our agricultural extension service.
4075,具体来说，这表现为“提挈农村”的运动。,"A third has been the influence of British paternalism and, more specifically, movements for ""village uplift."""
4076,在这方面，一个更有说眼力的例子是在当代的国际法中，牢固地树立—个合法的国家必须是一个维护某些共同的民主价值的网家这一观念的倾 向（参见Crawford和Marks，1998）。,"A further telling example in this regard is the tendency in contemporary international law to entrench the notion that a legitimate state must be a state that upholds certain common democratic values (see Crawford and Marks, 1998)."
4076,例如，《世界人权官言》第21条宣称，民主原则与某些列平出的权利一起作为一种“所有人民和国家追 求的共同标准”（参见UN，1988，第2、5页）。,"For instance, in Article 21 the ""Universal Declaration of Human Rights"" asserts the democratic principle along with enumerated rights as a ‘common standard of achievement for all peoples and nations’（see UN, 1988, pp. 2, 5)."
4076,但是，“民主”一词却并未出现在《宣言》中，并且形容词“民主的”也只出现了一次（在第29条）。,"However, the word ‘democracy’ does not itself appear in the Declaration and the adjective ‘democratic’ appears again only once (in Article 29)."
4076,相反，《联合国公民权利和政治权利国际公约》（1966，1976年开始实行）在第25条里详尽地阐述了这一原则，使很多不同的权利协议与协定形成一个有约束力的条约（参见UN，1988，第28页）。,"By contrast, the ""UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights"" (1966) (which came into force in 1976) elaborates this principle in Article 25, making a number of different rights agreements and conventions into a binding treaty (see UN, 1988, p. 28)."
4077,在欧盟国家范围内，美国电影票房收入所占的平均份额下降到1996年的63%，在法国下降至53%，而在英国下降到81%。,"The EU average for the share of US films in box office receipts dropped to 63 per cent in 1996, falling as low as 53 per cent in France and down to 81 per cent in the UK."
4077,最后，值得注意的是，虽然日本已经有相对发达的电影业，美国电影似乎较难渗透进日本市场，但日本也还是被美国电影征服了。,
4077,,"Finally, it should be noted, Japan, which has had a relatively healthy domestic industry and appeared to be a relatively difficult market for US films to penetrate, has succumbed to US movies as well."
4077,以美国电影为主的外国电影在日本总电影票房收入中占据的份额从1980年的45%上升至1990年的近60%，这个数字在90年代晚期继续向上攀升（Gyory和Glas，1994;《银屏摘要》，1996，1997c）。,"Foreign receipts at the Japanese box office - predominately American - have risen from 45 per cent of the total in 1980 to almost 60 per cent in 1990, a figure that has continued to creep upwards in the late 1990s (Gyory and Glas, 1994; Screen Digest, 1996, 1997c)."
4078,另一方面，他们所控制的政权又为其他阶层强有力的挑战所胁迫。,"On the other hand, they worked these levers within the context of strong challenges from other classes."
4078,把注意力集中于乡绅与贵族在正式的甚至非正式的政治机构中的强固地位，可能会对他们的权力造成一种错误印象。拿1832年的议会改革来说，这一改革使工业资产阶级获得了选举的权力。尽管这一改革使更激进的支持者感到失望，令顽固的反对者感到恐惧，但改革法案的实现意味着资产阶级已经初歩显示出了自己的力量。,"To concentrate on the strength of their position in the formal and even the informal apparatus of politics would give a misleading impression of the power of the gentry and the nobility，Even if the Reform Bill of 1832, which gave the industrial capitalists the vote, disappointed the hopes of its more ardent advocates and belied the fears of its more ardent opponents, its passage mean that the bourgeoisie had shown its teeth."
4078,这种情况同样表现在1846年《谷物法》受冲击的过程中。,The same can be said about the striking down of the Corn Laws in 1846.
4078,上层土地贵族并没有遭受灾难性的打击，但明白了他们所拥有权力的界限。,"The landed upper classes suffered no disaster, but they learned the limits of their power."
4079,概括地描述一下，这无非是英国从劫掠向官僚政治演化的过程。,"Such then, if in sketchy outline, was the evolution of the British from piracy to bureaucracy."
4079,以下的三个相互联系的阶段影响着印度杜会：起初，是英国人想通过建立法律秩序和固定税收，以及确立农村中的财产权的办法，来实现农业的商品化，结果这个做法失败了；第二步是农村手工业遭到局部破坏；最后一步是1857年试图挣脱英国人奴役的兵变的失败。,"Three interrelated consequences for Indian society followed: the beginnings of an abortive commercialization of agriculture through the establishment of law and order, regular taxes, and property in the countryside; secondly, the partial destruction of rural handicrafts, and, finally, an unsuccessful attempt to throw off the British yoke in the Mutiny of 1857.In turn these three processes set the basic framework for what has taken place down to the present day."
4079,反过来，这三个阶段又为从那时沿至今天的印度社会的多种变化提供了基本构架。,
4080,只说出9月屠杀的暴行而忘却隐藏于暴行之后的恐怖，无疑会落入偏见的陷阱。,To express outrage at the September massacres and forget the horrors behind them is to indulge in a partisan trick.
4080,从这一意义上说，这里就没有什么神秘之处值得揭示了。,In that sense there is no mystery here.In another there is.
4080,另—方面，进行这种揭示又确实有其意义。我们考察印度情况时就会更清楚地看到这一点。深重的苦难并不总是能导致革命的爆发，也并不一定会造成革命的形势。,"As we shall see most clearly later, when we come to consider India, severe suffering does not always and necessarily generate revolutionary outbursts, and certainly not a revolutionary situation."
4080,关于这一问题我暂时存而不论。,That problem must wait.
4080,而时下，我姑且把普遍的绝望和愤恨看作为对环境的一种反应来理解。,For the moment we may take it that popular desperation and anger were comprehensible reactions to cirmumstances.
4081,拜尔尼尔和其他旅游者提供的证据与我们从奥兰兹伯的谕令中所获悉的情况非常接近。,"Bernier’s evidence, as well as that of other travellers, fits closely with what we know of the situation from Aurangzeb’s orders."
4081,把他们的叙述归结起来可以看到，农民的负担沉重，处于严格的控制之下。与此同时，农民人数不断下降，其中一部分原因是逃离莫卧儿王朝辖区。,"Together they portray a situation in which the peasants are heavily assessed and kept under strict discipline, while at the same time they are decreasing in numbers, partly through flight to areas outside the Mogul jurisdiction."
4082,尽管困难重重，陆地上军事优势的平衡也开始转向西方。,"Despite many setbacks, the balance of military advantage on land too began to shift towards the West."
4082,在火力、军事组织、战术和后勤上的优势使得奥地利于1718年取得了对奥斯曼帝国的决定性胜利。,"Superior firepower, military organization, tactics and logistics contributed to Austria's decisive military defeat of the Ottoman Empire in 1718."
4082,“这个时期欧洲人在军事上优越于那些以前与其军事地位同等或更好的民族，特别是相对于土尔其人而言更为明显”（Black，1994，第14页）。,"The resulting Peace of Passarowitz witnessed the advent of 'the period when Europeans became militarily superior to peoples who in the past had been their equals or superiors, most notably the Turks' (Black, 1994, p. 14)."
4083,在中世纪的欧洲，火炮技术从意大利引入，不到20年的时间内，除了最边远的地区外，所有的地区都（通过竞争）拥有了自己的生产设施。,"Within medieval Europe cannon and artillery technology spread from Italy, such that within the space of twenty years all but the most peripheral regions had acquired (through emulation) their own production facilities."
4083,这种技术自从在欧洲首次出现50年之后就传到了巴尔干半岛和奥斯曼帝国。但是如果从制度机制和基础设施方面来看的话（通过此军事技术能力开始扩散），火药革命也代表了一个非常重要的阶段。,Five decades after first appearing in Europe the technology had reached the Balkans and the Ottoman Empire.But the gunpowder revolution also represented a quite important stage in respect of the institutional mechanisms and infrastructures by which military technological capability came to be spread.
4084,罗马共和国的政府机构分为三大部分。,"The government of the Roman Republic, then, consisted of three major elements."
4084,两个最高执政官和后来增选的执法官掌管着政府。,Two consuls and later other elected officials served as magistrates and ran the state.
4084,成年男性的大会（百人大会）由从最富裕公民中选出来的官员把持，而元老院则由一小部分大地主负责提建议。,"An assembly of adult males (the centuriate assembly), controlled by the wealthiest citizens, elected these officials, while the senate, a small group of large landowners, advised them."
4084,因此，罗马政府是一个少数特权集团控制的贵族共和国。,"The Roman state, then, was an aristocratic republic controlled by a relatively small group of privileged people."
4085,奥古斯都创建的新制度中，基本的政府构成是元首（奥古斯都）和贵族元老院，奥古斯都保留了元老院，作为罗马政府中的协商机构。,"In the new constitutional order that Augustus created, the basic governmental structure consisted of the princeps (Augustus) and an aristocratic senate.Augustus retained the senate as the chief deliberative body of the Roman state."
4085,它颁布的法令，经过元首的审査后，仍具有法律效力，元首这个称号本身并不承负权力，但奥古斯都一直到公元前23年每年都担任首席执政官，同时他也享有保民官的权力，这使他可以提交法律和有权否决任何公共事务。,"Its decrees, screened in advance by the princeps, now had the effect of law.The title of princeps carried no power in itself, but Augustus held the office of consul each year until 23 B.C., when he assumed the power of a tribune, which enabled him to propose laws and veto any item of public business."
4085,奥古斯都为其权力披上了合法的外衣，深受民众支持。,"By observing proper legal forms for his power, Augustus proved highly popular."
4086,第一次和第二次世界大战使人们逐渐认识到，如果针对人类暴力的大部分极端的形式都将被宣告为非法，并且国家间日益增强的相互秩序和依赖也得到公认的话，那么，国际治理就不能依赖于权力的平衡。,"The First and Second World Wars led to a growing acknowledgement that international governance could not rely on the balance of power if the most extreme forms of violence against humanity were to be outlawed, and the growing interconnectedness and interdependence of nations recognized."
4086,国际规制的威斯特伐利亚概念的主体、范围来源，特别是其国际法的概念，都逐渐受到了挑战 （参见 Bull，1977，第6章）。,"Slowly, the subject, scope and very sources of the Westphalian conception of international regulation, particularly its conception of international law, were all challenged (see Bull, 1977, ch. 6)."
4086,对一些已经发生的、最重要的法律变革作归纳将是非常有益的，因为这些变革预示着在全球政治中所发生的根本性的变化。,"It is useful to summarize some of the main legal transformations that have taken place, since these are indicative of underlying changes in global politics."
4087,欧盟的15个成员国与共享制度提供了一个核心，欧洲其他活动都围绕它进行。,The fifteen EU members and their shared institutions provide a core around which the rest of European interaction is increasingly focused.
4087,但即使在联盟内部，最初的6个成员国与后来的成员国之间也有明显的差别。,"However, even within the Union there are clearly differences between the original six members and the later members."
4087,除了欧盟这一核心，欧洲自由贸易联盟（EFTA） 和北约（NATO ）的欧洲成员形成了另外一个互动中心圈和制度形式，以防北约将欧洲锁定在全球军事网络中，斯堪的纳维亚国家的制度与相互联系切断欧盟的组织。问题：漏译和错译改1：欧洲剩余国家的互动越来越围绕它进行   ：在北约一案中，其将欧洲锁定在全球军事网络，而在 北欧国家一案中，其存在的制度与互动割断了欧洲的体系。,"Beyond the EU core, EFTA and NATO membership produces a second concentric ring of interaction and institutional forms in the European region: in the case of NATO institutions lock Europe into global military networks, while in the case of the Scandinavian countries institutions and interactions exist which cut across EU regimes."
4088,地区性市场构建的法律框架恰好能说明这个问题，如谈判中的单一欧洲市场或北美自由贸易区。,"This is well illustrated by the extensive legal frameworks drawn up for regional markets, such as in the negotiation of the Single European Market or NAFTA."
4088,"因为世贸组织和经合发国家追求更大程度的贸易自由化，所以，它们活动的焦点已转向了国内竞争和商业规则的协调上来。在某种程度上，这些规则被认为是全球自由贸易的主要障碍。（Trebilcock, 1996； Jonquiéres, 1998）","As the WTO and OECD states seek greater trade liberalization, the focus of their activity has shifted towards the harmonization of domestic competition and business rules in so far as these are perceived as the major remaining barriers to global free trade (Trebilcock, 1996; Jonquiéres, 1998)."
4089,戴高乐作为新的总统，力图使法国重回大国行列。,"As the new president, de Gaulle sought to return France to the position of a great power."
4089,他相信，使法国在冷战中起到一种枢纽作用将会提升其地位。,He believed that playing a pivotal role in the Cold War might enhance France’s stature.
4089,为此，他使法国从北约的司令部中退了出来。,"For that reason, he pulled France out of the NATO high command."
4090,另一方面，这样的过程如果没有鼓励解全球化的过程，那么也能够限制全球化。,"On the other hand, such processes can impose limits to globalization, if not encouraging a process of deglobalization."
4090,然而，没有理由认为本土化或区域化与全球化是对立或矛盾的关系。,"However, there is no a priori reason to assume that localization or regionalization exist in an oppositional or contradictory relationship to globalization."
4090,在经济或者其他领域中，这些过程如何相互联系更具有实证性，在后面的各章中我们将进行讨论。,"Precisely how these processes interrelate in economic and other domains is more an empirical matter, and one which is dealt with in subsequent chapters."
4091,在1967年英国货币贬值和加入欧共体后，出口和贸易水平在60年代晚期才开始上升。,Export and trade intensity started to rise in the late 1960s following the 1967 sterling devaluation and subsequent EEC entry.
4091,70年代早期，由于英国货币浮动机制的支撑，其贸易依存度迅速增加。,"Trade levels rose sharply in the early 1970s, aided by the floating of sterling."
4091,到70年代中期，出口依存度和私人部门贸易依存度已经达到古典金本位时代的水平（见图3-5）。,By the mid-1970s ratios of exports and trade to private GDP had reached classical Gold Standard levels (see figure 3.5).
4092,贸易的国际竞争，特别是来自发展中国家贸易的国际竞争，经常被认为是把工资、社会和环保标准减到了最低水平（例如，见Hines和Lang，1993）。,"International competition through trade, especially from developing countries, is often assumed to reduce wages and social and environmental standards to the lowest common denominator (see, for instance, Hines and Lang,1993)."
4092,富于戏剧性的是，标准贸易理论预言不同国家的工资水平通过贸易将趋于一致；在劳动力密集的国家，工资起初很低，但随后会上升。在劳动力缺乏的国家，工资起初很高，但随后就会下降。,"A little less dramatically, standard trade theory predicts that wages will converge between countries through trade, rising in labour-abundant countries, where they are initially low, and falling in labour scarce countries,where they are initially high."
4093,尽管发展中国家外国直接投资仅占全球外国直接投资存量的不足10%，但它们已逐渐增长。,FDI outflows from developing countries are growing although they account for less than 10 per cent of global FDI stocks.
4093,地理上的跨国并购又加强了这一趋势（见表5-2）。,This picture is reinforced by the geography of cross-border mergers and acquisitions (see table 5.2 above).
4093,这种活动越来越少集中在经合发国家，而是广泛地分散开来。,Such activity is becoming less concentrated among OECD states and more widely diffused.
4094,商业环境中的解除管制和自由化（参看第4章和第5章）已经对通信领域产生了重要影响。,Deregulation and liberalization of the business environment (see chapters 4 and 5) have had a major impact on the communications sector.
4094,世界各地的电信公司已经私有化，外国竞争者已经进入了以前封闭的市场，而且出现了多国联盟的浪潮。,"Telecommunication corporations have been privatized all over the world, foreign competitors have entered previously closed markets and there has been a wave of multinational alliances."
4094,同时，取得跨媒体的所有权的障碍已经减少，外国公司被允许购买国内公司。,"At the same time, barriers to cross-media ownership have come down, and foreign firms have been allowed to purchase domestic corporations."
4095,临时政府同时还面对着另一个权威，苏维埃，或说工人士兵代表委员会，苏维埃在城市、工业城镇、部队和乡村地区中如雨后春笋般自发产生。,"The Provisional Government also faced another authority, the soviets, or councils of workers’ and soldiers’ deputies.Soviets sprang up spontaneously in cities, factory towns, army units, and rural areas."
4095,苏维埃代表着更为激进的下层阶级的利益，主要是由各种不同的社会主义者组成的。,The soviets represented the more radical interests of the lower classes and were largely composed of socialists of different kinds.
4095,其中的一个团体，布尔什维克，逐渐开姶发挥关键作用。,"One group, the Bolsheviks, came to play a crucial role."
4096,第一次世界大战之后，全面裁军的提倡者们发现国际联盟为进一步的裁军提供了新的制度性论坛（Howard，1981）。,"In the aftermath of the First World War the advocates of general and complete disarmament discovered, in the League of Nations, a new institutional forum within which to further the disarmament project (Howard, 1981)."
4096,从1932-1934年，世界上64个被承认的国家在日内瓦举行的世界裁军大会上聚集讨论全面裁军的过程。,From 1932 to 1934 all the worlds sixty-four recognized states met in Geneva at the World Disarmament Conference to initiate the process of general and complete disarmament.
4096,但是谈判破裂，收效甚微，“现实主义”战胜了“理想主义”。,But ‘realism’ triumphed over ‘idealism’，with the conference breaking up having achieved little.
4096,由于国际联盟转而讨论欧洲安全问题，德国侵略了苏台德地区，从而结束了全面裁军计划。,"As the League returned to discussing the dangers of level-crossings in Europe, Germany invaded the Sudetenland, putting an end to the general and complete disarmament project."
4097,大多数的国际贸易仍然集中在初级产品部门。,Most international business remained concentrated in the primary products sector.
4097,主要的石油公司继续控制这些部门，而其他的跨国公司开始控制采矿和一系列的金属加工业。,"The leading oil firms continued to dominate this sector, while other MNCs came to control the mining and processing of a range of metals."
4097,主营水果的美国公司、经营茶叶和糖的英国公司投资于种植业，并逐渐控制这些产品的贸易往来。,"US companies, in fruit, and British companies, in tea and sugar, invested in plantations and came to dominate trade in these commodities."
4098,北部地区因不存在着这两大障碍，磨坊和磨坊主很快就几乎遍及每个采邑。,"These obstacles were absent in the northern lands, so the mill and the miller soon were to be found in almost every manor."
4098,在地中海盆地，水车原是专用于碾米的工具，中世纪时发展成一般性的原动机。,"And whereas the water wheel had been employed in the Mediterranean basin as a specialized device for grinding grain, in the course of the Middle Ages it was developed into a generalized prime mover."
4098,于是，水力开始用于银锤和锻炉风箱，用于大型锯机和车床，用于织布的浆洗机、造纸的纸浆机和碎矿的捣矿机。,"Thus water power came to be used for forge hammers and forge bellows; for sawmills and lathes; and for fulling mills making cloth, pulping mills making paper, and stamping mills crushing ore."
4099,领主－封臣关系总体上是自由民之间的荣誉关系，并无任何奴役的含义。,"At all levels, the lord-vassal relationship was always an honorable relationship between free men and did not imply any sense of servitude."
4099,鉴于9世纪外敌冲击之下国家分崩离析，国王无法提供安全保障，分封制迅速扩展。,"Since kings could no longer provide security in the midst of the breakdown created by the invasions of the ninth century, the practice of subinfeudation became ever more widespread."
4099,由于领主拥有司法权，采邑制赋予了领主事实上的政府权利。,"With their rights of jurisdiction, fiefs gave lords virtual possession of the rights of government."
4099,问题：不符合中文表达，错译改1：领主－封臣关系总体上是自由民之间的荣誉关系，并无任何奴役的含义。,
4099,鉴于9世纪外敌冲击之下国家分崩离析，国王无法提供安全保障，分封制迅速扩展。,
4099,由于领主拥有司法权，采邑制赋予了领主事实上的统治权利。,
4100,大体上说来，海森堡提出，没有人能够确知一个电子的运动轨迹，因为通过光来观测电子的这个行为本身将会扰乱电子的位置。,"In essence, Heisenberg suggested that no one could determine the path of an electron because the very act of observing the electron by illuminating it with light affected the electron's location."
4100,然而，测不准原理不止于对电子轨迹的解释；它是 一种新的世界观。,"The uncertainty principle was more than an explanation for the path of an electron, however; it was a new world view."
4100,海森堡击碎了人们对可预测性的信心，勇于宣布测不准原理是一切物理法则的基础。,Heisenberg shattered confidence in predictability and dared to propose that uncertainty was at the root of all the physical laws.
4101,日益发展的交通基础设施便贸易活动大大便利。,Evolving transport infrastructures have facilitated trade greatly.
4101,另外，一系列制度化的贸易安排的确立，也大大减少了长距离贸易中保护财产权的困难。,"Moreover, the difficulties of securing property rights in long-distance trade have also culminated in the establishment of a variety of institutionalized trade arrangements."
4101,全球贸易网络和市场在不同时期都出现过，但它们的历史形态不同。,"Global trading networks and markets have emerged at various times, but they have taken a variety of historical forms."
4101,随着调节国家和公司的行为与贸易政策的全球法律框架的出现，贸易关系也已制度化了。,"Trade relations too have been institutionalized, as global legal frameworks have emerged governing the conduct and trade policy of nations and firms."
4102,随着发展中国家增加了其低技术含量产品的出口，发达国家则在高技术含量产品的生产中日益专业化，这就使具有相间技能的工人集团的工资水平在国际上有趋同倾向（Wood，1994）。,"As developing countries have expanded their exports of low skill products and developed countries have become increasingly specialized in high skill goods,this has produced significant international convergence in wages for groups of workerswith similar skill levels (Wood, 1994)."
4102,发达国家低技术工业的衰落大大地减少了对非熟练工人的需求，从而导致工资下降和失业增加。据伍德估计，同没有这样的产业内贸易的假定状况相比，对非熟练劳动力的需求以20%以上的速度下降（Wood，1994，1995）。,"The decline in low skill industries within developed economies has sharply reduced demand for unskilled workers, leading to falling wagesand rising unemployment; in Wood's estimate, demand for unskilled labour has fallenby over 20 per cent compared to the hypothetical situation without such inter-industry trade (Wood, 1994, 1995)."
4103,随着产业内贸易的扩展，全球竞争跨越了国境，直接影响着地方经济。国内市场逐渐与其他市场融合在一起。,"National markets are increasingly enmeshed with one another as intra-industry trade has expanded and global competition transcends national borders, impacting directly on local economies."
4103,在这些方面，各个公司面对着一个潜在的全球性市场，同时，它们还要在其国内市场上面对多国公司的直接竞争。,In these respects individual firms are confronted by a potential global marketplace while they simultaneously face direct competition from foreign firms in their own domestic markets.
4104,随着中世纪欧洲秩序的崩溃，这种无组织的“武器市场”的政治基础也瓦解了。,"With the collapse of the medieval European order, the political foundations of this disorganized 'arms market' were undermined."
4104,当各国开始发展更长久的军事组织形式（比如常备军和海军）之后，对更加有理性、有组织的武器生产的需求也随之增长。,"As states began to develop more permanent forms of military organization, such as standing armies and navies, so the need for more rationally organized arms production grew."
4104,各国政府都试图垄断与军事相关的生产与贸易，其发展也被一种自给自足的政策合法化。,"State authorities sought to monopolize military-related production and commerce, developments legitimated by a policy of autarky."
4105,另一原因是，希腊多数城邦都享有直接通达大海的便利，既有发展经济的优势，又能引进人才和技术。,"Another was the direct access to the sea enjoyed by most of the Greek city-states, which gave them economic strength as well as intellectual stimulation."
4105,确实，希腊人为各自为政的城邦付出了沉重代价：城邦间彼此征战不休，最终导致外部世界强加的统一，先来自马其顿，后来自罗马。,"It is true that the Greeks paid a heavy price for their polis fragmentation in the form of continual wars.And war led eventually to unification imposed from without, first by Macedon and then by Rome."
4105,但是，作为回报，他们在各自的城邦内享受到好几个世纪的自由；而这，似乎至少是希腊5世纪迸发出巨大创造力的先决条件。,"But in the meantime they enjoyed centuries of freedom within their respective states, and this freedom was a prerequisite for the great creative outburst of the fifth century."
4106,我们研究的6个经合组织成员国对气候变迁和臭氧消失问题都难辞其咎，目前，它们所释放的物质占了全球释放物的1/3（参看图8-4），但其拥有的人口却不到世界总人口的15%。这6个国家在环境问题上所负责任的差异性远远超过了它们作为西方工业化国家集团的一部分的基本相似性。,"As contributors to the problems of climate change and ozone depletion, the differences between our six OECD countries are outweighed by their basic similarities as part of the bloc of Western industrialized countries who currently contribute over a third of global emissions (see figure 8.4), but contain less than 15 per cent of the world's population."
4106,如果按人均平均释放量来计算，整个经合组织大大超过了平均数。,"In per capita terms, the OECD as a whole is contributing far more than its fair share of emissions."
4106,问题：错译改1：它们所释放的物质占了全球释放物的超过三分之一,
4107,两次大战期间政治和经济的不稳定刺激了世界军事费用的增长，使其超过了战前的开支水平（Sloutzki，1941，第23页）。,"Political and economic instability during the interwar years encouraged a growth in world military spending which remained in excess of prewar levels (Sloutzki, 1941, p. 23)."
4107,随着军事开支的增长，武器贸易和武装力量也得以增长，这一直持续到1929年的大危机（参见图2-1）。,"As military spending grew, so too, until the 1929 crash, did the trade in arms and armaments (A&A) (see figure 2.1)."
4107,即使在20世纪30年代的大萧条时期，武器出口下降的速率也要比其他方面出口下降的速率慢，并且它很快又得以恢复（Sloutzki，1941，第67页）。,"Even throughout the 1930s depression, arms exports fell much less sharply than did exports in general and they recovered much more rapidly (Sloutzki, 1941, p. 67)."
4108,创新能力是外国直接投资进入发达国家的一个重要的决定性因素（Narula，1996，第4章）。,"Innovatory capacity is now a significant determinant of inward FDI into developed countries (Narula, 1996,ch. 4)."
4108,随之而来的是，跨国公司不仅使生产多样化，而且使它们的研发行为多样化以保持创新和竞争优势，多样化的研发活动常常集中在经合发国家（Archibugi和Michie，1997a）。,"Consequently MNCs are not just diversifying production but also their R&D operations to sustain innovation and a competitive edge.This diversification of R&D still tends to be highly geographically concentrated within OECD states (Archibugi and Michie, 1997a)."
4108,然而，许多跨国公司很少像以前那样依靠国内基础。,Nevertheless many MNCs are less reliant on their home base than was previously the case.
4109,村舍工业是一种实实在在的家庭企业——女人和孩子们纺纱，男人则织布，这种收入可以贴补他们作为农业工人的可怜收入。,"The cottage industry was truly a family enterprise--women and children could spin while men wove on the looms, enabling rural people to supplement their pitiful wages as agricultural laborers."
4109,18世纪，村舍工业扩展到欧洲农村的许多地区。,The cottage system spread to many areas of rural Europe in the eighteenth century.
4109,但是在该世纪后半叶，开始发生了重大变化，这些变化将很快改革工业生产模式。,"But in the second half of the century, significant changes began to occur that would soon revolutionize industrial production."
4110,存在主义是对20世纪文明价值观的明显没落引致的绝望的反应。,Existentialism was one response to the despair generated by the apparent collapse of civilized values in the twentieth century.
4110,宗教复兴则是另外一种反应。,The revival of religion was another.
4110,甚至从18世纪的启蒙运动开姶，基督教和其他宗教已经在进行防御。,"Ever since the Enlightenment of the eighteenth century, Christianity and religion had been on the defensive."
4110,但不少宗教思想家和宗教首领在20世纪让基督教获得了新的生命力。,"But a number of council of the Catholic church.Known as Vatican II, the council liberalized a number of religious thinkers and leaders attempted to bring new life to Christianity in the twentieth century."
4111,大分裂严重地破坏了基督教信徒的信仰。,The Great Schism badly damaged the faith of Christian believers.
4111,教皇被民众认为是基督教界的领导者，正如卜尼法斯八世指出的，教皇手握通向天国之门的钥匙。,"The pope was widely believed to be the leader of Christendom and, as Boniface VIII had pointed out, held the keys to the kingdom of heaven."
4111,由于两派教皇公然谴贵对方是反基督者，这种公开的攻击不仅毫无裨益，反而破坏了构成教会重要基础的教阶制度。,"Since both lines of popes denounced the other as the Antichrist, such a spectacle could not help but undermine the institution that had become the very foundation of the church."
4111,大分裂给普通基督徒的日常生活带来了不稳定因素。,The Great Schism introduced uncertainty into the daily lives of ordinary Christians.
4112,被称为党卫军特别行动队的流动杀戮队的行动是大屠杀中的第一阶段。,The activities of the mobile killing units known as the Einsatzgruppen were the first stage in the mass killings of the Holocaust.
4112,图中所示照片是一位党卫军特别行动队的成员在屠杀一位犹太人。,This picture shows the execution of a Jew by a member of one of these SS killing squads.
4112,旁观者包括德国军人、德国劳工组织的人员，甚至还有希特勒青年团的成员。,"Onlookers include members of the German Army, the German Labor Service, and even Hitler Youth."
4112,这种屠杀方式后来被认为效率不高，被死亡集中营所取代。,"When it became apparent that this method of killing was inefficient, it was replaced by the death camps."
4113,在战后几十年中，国际贸易、投资以及生产崩溃了。,"In the decades after the war international trade, investment and production collapsed."
4113,20世纪20年代的微小复苏被30年代的大萧条破坏了。,Small revivals in the 1920s were undercut by the Great Depression of the 1930s.
4113,尽管华尔街的崩溃以及萧条的影响说明世界经济相互依存的程度，但球经济被分裂成为帝国集团。,"Although the impact of the Wall Street crash and the depression indicated the degree to which the world remained economically interdependent, the result was a fracturing of what was left of the global economy into imperial blocs."
4114,主要的欧洲国家都在自由主义实践方面取得了可观的进步，例如宪法、议会，尤其是大众政治的实现。,"Within the major European states, considerable progress was made in achieving such liberal practices as constitutions and parliaments, but it was largely in western Europe that mass politics became a reality."
4114,推动政治民主扩展的改革也引人注目，主要表现于男性选民范围的扩大以及大众政党的发展。,Reforms encouraged the expansion of political democracy through voting rights for men and the creation of mass political parties.
4114,然而，与此同时，旧的政治势力仍很强大的欧洲国家中，这些发展受到了强有力的抵制。,"At the same time, however, these latter developments were strongly resisted in parts of Europe where the old political forces remained strong."
4115,1941年6月，党卫军特别行动队被授予新的责任，成为流动杀戮队。,"In June 1941, the Einsatzgruppen were given new responsibilities as mobile killing units."
4115,这些党卫军死亡小队跟随着正规军进入苏联境内。,These SS death squads followed the regular army’s advance into Russia.
4115,他们的工作是围捕和杀戮村庄中的犹太人，将其埋葬在大墓坑中，这些大墓坑通常由受害者被枪决前所挖。,"Their job was to round up Jews in their villages and execute and bury them in mass graves, often giant pits dug by the victims themselves before they were shot."
4116,德川幕府通过赐予新俸的办法，一举消除了过去政治动乱的一个主要因素。,"The Tokugawa Shogunate, by making them recipients of stipends, cut them off from independent bases of power in the countryside and eliminated at one stroke one of the chief sources of political instability of the preceding era."
4116,同时，德川幕府通过使武士丧失在日本社会的任何功能，也使贫穷的武士成为一个日渐扩大的集团。他们在后来推翻幕府统治的斗争中起了关键作用。,"At the same time, through the imposition of peace, the Shogunate deprived the samurai of any real function in Japanese society and contributed to the creation of a group - the impoverished samurai - that played a key role in its eventual overthrow."
4117,战后初期的大部分时间里，直到70年代，除了英国以外，其他的欧洲国家都完全依赖美国许可生产的许多军事设备，德国和法国更是如此。,"For much of the early postwar period, up until the 1970s, all except Britain relied considerably on US licensed production for a range of military equipment.This was particularly the case in respect of France and Germany."
4117,这些国家建立了它们的国防工业基础后，本国的防卫产品生产扩大了。但是，当70年代国防开支持续上升而国家的采购预算却紧缩时，跨国的武器生产合作压力大幅度增加。,"As these states rebuilt their national DIB, indigenous defence production expanded, but as defence costs continued to rise and national procurements budgets were squeezed in the 1970s, the pressures for transnational arms collaboration increased considerably."
4118,动力之一来自贵族的行动以及国王在等级会议前后的犹豫不决和摇摆。,One impulse came from the actions of the nobility and the vacillations of the king preceding and following the meeting of the Estates General.
4118,当然，农民对于究竟是按命令还是按自己的意志来选举这一类问题既不理解也不关心，尽管法国的其他人都在热烈地讨论这个问题。,"Certainly the peasants neither understood nor cared much about such questions as voting by order or voting by head, which agitated the rest of France."
4118,他们似乎也不很关心波旁王朝的财政摇摇欲坠的特点及其破产的前景。,Nor were they very likely to be deeply concerned about the rickety character of Bourbon finances and the prospect of bankruptcy.
4119,日心说在当时几乎没有产生什么影响，大多数人并未打算接受哥白尼的学说。,The heliocentric theory had little immediate impact; most people were not yet ready to accept Copernicus’thinking.
4119,但是对于托勒密体系的置疑却日渐增多。,But doubts about the Ptolemaic system were growing.
4119,进一步摧毁地心说、支持哥白尼体系的工作落在了德国科学家约翰开普勒的肩上。,The next step in destroying the geocentric conception and supporting the Copernican system was taken by the German scientist Johannes Kepler.
4120,世界军事秩序是一个相对较新的概念，它指的是政治实体（无论是民族国家、城市国家，还是帝国）之间的军事关系和军事活动（从战争到军事生产）构成一个复杂的互动领域（包括其结构和动力）的方式。,"The concept of a world military order is of relatively recent origin.It refers to the ways in which military relations and activities (from war to military production) between political entities (whether nation-states, city-states or empires) constitute a complex field of interaction which embodies its own structure and dynamics."
4120,虽然为了分析的目的有必要对这3个方式——战争体系、武器动态和地缘管理——进行区分，但军事全球化的历史形式是由它们之间的相互影响、相互作用共同构成的。问题：漏译改1:但历史上的世界军事秩序和军事全球化的历史形式是由它们之间的相互影响、相互作用共同构成的，认识到这一点至关重要。,"Although for analytical purposes it is helpful to distinguish between these three facets - the war system, the arms dynamic, and geogovernance - it is crucially important to recognize that both historical world military orders and historical forms of military globalization are constituted by, and through, their interaction."
4121,第一，具有重要战略意义的殖民地几乎从一开始就被卷入冲突中。,"First, strategically significant imperial possessions were drawn into the conflict almost from the outset."
4121,战争行动扩展到了非洲和中东地区；第二，工业化改变了现代战争的特质。,"Hostilities spread to Africa and the Middle East.Second, industrialization had transformed the nature of modern warfare."
4121,巨型战争武器被发明创造出来，但为了使它们能够有效地发挥其效能，就要求进行全民族甚至是全帝国范围的动员。,Huge war machines had been created.But in order to function efficiently they required the mobilization of entire nations and empires.
4122,日本没有平民元首或领袖，而是由天皇充当民族的象征。,Japan had no plebeian Fuhrer or Duce.Instead the Emperor served as a national symbol in much the same way.
4122,日本也没有真正有效率的单独的群众政党。,Nor did Japan have a really effective single mass party.
4122,帝制促进会只是一种相当低劣的模仿品。,The Imperial Rule Assistance Association was a rather second-rate imitation.
4122,最后，日本政府与希特勒反犹太人的做法不同，它并没有实行大规模的恐怖政策来消灭基本人口中的某个特殊部分。,"Finally, the Japanese government did not engage in a massive policy of terror and extermination against a specific segment of the underlying population as did Hitler against the Jews."
4123,首先这个保护层是对联邦本身的保护。与西部在战后发展起来后， 联邦却成了世界上最大的国内市场之一。,"First among the ramparts was the preservation of the Union itself, which meant, as the West filled up after the war, one of the largest domestic markets of the world."
4123,它也是截至当时美国历史上受最高关税保护的市场。,It was also a market protected by the highest tariff to date in the nation’s history.
4123,根据第14条修正案，财产受到政府的保护，在实践中却往往带有不健康的倾向。,Property received protection from state governments with unsound inclinations through the Fourteenth Amendment.
4123,同样，货币流通通过国家银行系统以及硬币支付措施的恢复，打下了牢固的基础。,Likewise the currency was put on a sound footing through the national banking system and the resumption of specie payments.
4124,西方商业、贸易和政治组织的兴起所产生的影响就是改变了以往直接统治的做法，并推动了非领土全球化的新形式的产生—即没有领土的全球化（参见Pieterse，1997）。,"The influence of Western commerce, trade and political organization was to outlive direct rule, giving rise to new patterns of non-territorial globalization - globalization without territory (see Pieterse, 1997)."
4124,那些强大的国家性经济实体通常可以在过去的殖民地区保持原有的支配地位，它们的做法就是用银行、公司和国际组织这些“看不见的政府”取代过去的“看得见的统治”（Ferro，1997，第349〜350页，参见后面的3〜5章）。,"Powerful national economic interests were often able to retain hegemonic positions over former colonial territories through the replacement of 'a visible presence of rule' with the 'invisible government' of banks, companies and international organizations (Ferro, 1997, pp. 349-50: see chapters 3-5 below)."
4124,当然，在许多情况下，这一过程不得不在第二次世界大战之后，非殖民地化的正式过程最终完成之后才得以进行。,"Of course, in many cases, this process would have to wait until after the Second World War and the formal initiation of decolonization to be finally completed."
4125,从1990年到1996年，6年时间里，仅电话线路就从5.2亿条增加到了7.18亿条。最大的增长来自于亚洲（国际电信组织估计，Financial Times，1998年3月17日，第1页）。,"In the six-year period from 1990 to 1996, the number of telephone lines alone increased from 520 million to 718 million, with the biggest growth coming from Asia (ITU estimates, Financial Times, 17 Mar. 1998, p. 1)."
4125,更有甚者，全世界的电视、广播频道和卫星轨道变得更加拥挤，国际电信组织在分配开发可用频率和不受干扰的卫星频道的权利方面的作用变得越来越重要。,"Moreover, as the world's airwaves and satellite orbits have become more crowded, the role of the international telecommunications regime has become increasingly important in allocating international rights to exploit usable frequencies and satellite orbital slots free from undue interference."
4126,计算机工业和生产电视、录像机这样的消费电器业之间有一些重要的共同特征，当然也还有一些关键区别。,"There are important common features between the computer industry and that part of the electronics industry focused on consumer products such as televisions, VCRs, etc.; there are also some key differences."
4126,东亚和北美的多数计算机出口到其他地区，而且有可能多数计算机贸易是在跨国公司内进行的（OECD.1996a，第3章）。,"Most East Asian and North American computer exports are to other regions and probably most trade in computers is intrafirm (OECD, 1996a, ch. 3)."
4126,电子工业基本上受美国和日本的公司控制，欧洲的公司只拥有少量的份额。,"The industry is dominated by US and Japanese firms, with European firms holding much smaller shares."
4127,奥地利于是在7月28日向塞尔维亚宣战。,Austria then declared war on Serbia on July 28.
4127,俄国仍在为其在1908年波斯尼亚危机中所受羞辱而耿耿于怀，因此决定支持塞尔维亚。,"Still smarting from its humiliation in the Bosnian crisis of 1908, Russia was determined to support Serbia’s cause."
4127,7月28日，沙皇尼古拉二世针对奥地利对俄国军队进行了部分动员。,"On July 28, Tsar Nicholas II ordered partial mobilization of the Russian army against Austria."
4128,政府只要一遇到抵抗，就马上后撤。,"As the government encountered resistance, it drew back."
4128,到了1771年，主要的推动力就消失了。,The main impulse died down by 1771.
4128,胆怯是即将走向灭亡的旧统治者的主要特点。,Timidity was the dominant note of the ancient regime down to its end.
4128,重农论者的进攻持续了很长时间，不过他们迟迟不敢进攻封建主义。,The physiocratic attack lasted longer.For a long time they did not dare attack feudalism.
4128,但是在1776年杜尔哥内阁中的邦塞特（他是杜的朋友和秘书）提议：至少在下届政府中，应当恢复封建租金。,"But in 1776 under Turgot’s ministry his friend and secretary Boncerf proposed, at least for the next generation, the financial redemption of feudal dues."
4129,杜鲁门向国会提出，要给予希腊和土耳其4亿美元的经济和军事援助。杜魯门主义实际上意味着，美国将为任何声称受到共产主义扩张威胁的国家提供钱财支持。,"Truman requested $400 million in economic and military aid for Greece and Turkey from the U.S. Congress.The Truman Doctrine said, in essence, that the United States would provide money to countries that claimed they were threatened by Communist expansion."
4129,杜鲁门总统提出，假如苏联在希腊的扩张没有被制止的话，美国将会被迫面临共产主义在整个自由世界的扩张。,"If the Soviets were not stopped in Greece, the United States would have to face the spread of communism throughout the free world."
4130,然而，这样一种策略已经表明，它对发达资本主义国家的自主产生了更加内部的而不是外部的压力。,"However, such a strategy illuminates a further domestic, rather than external, constraint on the autonomy of SIACS."
4130,因为总的来说，发达资本主义国家不是文化交流有效的催化剂，尤其是在那些自由民主的社会，它们被剥夺了对教育和文化输出的任何形式的垄断。,"For SIACS are, in general, poor catalysts for cultural change, and especially in liberal democratic societies where they are deprived of any kind of monopoly over education and cultural outputs."
4130,发达资本主义国家希望实现一种真正的多元文化主义，这个想法必定是从一个更加开明的和多元文化的公民社会中得到启示和支持的。,"SIACS wishing to implement a genuine multiculturalism will have to take their cue, and draw support, from a more enlightened and multicultural civil society."
4130,但是，实现这个想法所需的资源总是非常少，需要经常补充。,But the resources for this often seem perilously small and in need of repair.
4131,国家之间互相联络的增长越来越受到欧洲扩张的影响，尽管与此同时，其他地方的一些帝国（如俄罗斯）的扩张也正在进行（Ferro，1997，第2章）。,"The growth of the interconnections between states became progressively shaped by the expansion of Europe, although imperial expansion elsewhere, for instance from Russia, ran concurrent with it (Ferro, 1997, ch. 2)."
4131,欧洲的扩张同时还导致了原有的、陈旧的、非欧洲国际体系的土崩瓦解。,"The expansion of Europe led also to the dismantling of older, non-European interstate connections."
4131,现代国家体系的主要特征—政治权力的集中化，政府管理职能的扩张，领土管理，外交体系，常备军队的出现—这些在16世纪和17世纪的欧洲尚处于萌芽阶段的东西，即将成为全球秩序的普遍特征。,"Key features of the modern states system - the centralization of political power, the expansion of state administration, territorial rule, the diplomatic system, the emergence of regular, standing armies - which existed in Europe in embryo in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were to become prevalent features of the global order."
4131,起初，促使这些特征出现的主要动力指欧洲国家借助于军事力量，以及能够进行远洋航行的海军力量而拥有的进行海外活动的能力。,"The main vehicle for this was, to begin with, the European states' capacity for overseas operations by means of military and naval forces capable of long-range navigation."
4132,这样，即便战后发达国家的工资水平有明显的趋同，这也应归功于生产力水平的均衡，而不是因为贸易（Dollar和Wolff， 1993; Wolff， 1997）。,"Thus, although there has been a marked convergence in postwar wage levels among developed countries, this has been due to the convergence in productivity levels rather than to trade (Dollar and Wolff, 1993; Wolff, 1997)."
4132,在已经保持明显技术优势的国家，这种状况促使它们付出较高工资。,Where countries have sustained specific technological advantages this has enabled them to pay higher wages.
4132,在技术被用于非贸易品，征税以支持公共服务的国家，它们则有助于在其余经济部门保持可比的工资水平。,"Where these are spent on nonreadable, and taxed to fund public services, they can help to maintain comparable wage levels in the rest of the economy."
4133,但是，正如19世纪一样，当代迁移带来的经济利益是向国内汇款。,"But, as in the nineteenth century, the main economic benefit of contemporary migration is the reverse flow of remittances from workers to their home country."
4133,1990年，发展中闹家收到与移民有关的总汇款量为460亿美元，净汇款量为370亿美元（UNDP， 1994）。,"In 1990 developing countries received a gross flow of $46 billion linked to migrants and net income of $37 billion (UNDP, 1994)."
4133,由于这些汇款有相当一部分没有经过官方的渠道，因此，总汇款量可能会更高，而且超过了官方对这些国家的发展援助资金（参看 Atalik 和 Beeley， 1993）。,"Given that a very considerable volume of these flows does not pass through official channels, total remittances are likely to be much higher and, thereby, exceed official development aid flows to these states (see Atalik and Beeley, 1993)."
4134,直到80年代，工业化国家贸易开放的趋势才同发展中世界相符合。,Until the 1980s the trend towards greater trade openness among industrialized countries was not generally matched in the developing world.
4134,许多发展中国家诞生于两次世界大战之间，怀疑开放的贸易体制能否带来收益，并且优先发展国内工业基础。,Many developing countries emerged from the interwar years sceptical of the benefits of an open trading system and gave priority to building a national industrial base.
4134,它们采取的保护主义实际上更多地归因于当时的便利条件，不是国家的基本目标，但它对贸易政策有决定性的影响。,"The resultant protectionism may in practice have owed more to temporary expediency than coherent national goals, but it had a decisive impact on their trade policies."
4135,有些法国人移向了美国和魁北克更北的地区。,Some French emigration had occurred both to the USA and to Quebec further north.
4135,然而，随着七年战争的失败、美国殖民地的丢失和法国大革命的影响，法国跨越大西洋的移民逐渐减少了。,"However, with defeat in the Seven Years' War, the loss of American colonies and the cataclysm of the French Revolution, French transatlantic migration dwindled."
4135,在17和18世纪，荷兰、葡萄牙和西班牙在非洲和太平洋建立的贸易站和港口只带来了少量的欧洲移民。,"The establishment of trading posts and coastal forts by the Dutch, Portuguese and Spanish in Africa and the Pacific in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries had precipitated no more than a trickle of European migrants."
4136,在1838——1848年这十年中间，面对宪章派的鼓动，也没有出现什么强硬的反动政策。,"In the face of Chartist agitation too, during the decade 1838-1848, no very strong diehard policy of reaction emerged."
4136,在维多利亚女王和烕灵顿公爵的促使下，保守党人政府的确曾动用过军队，拆检私人信件以收集情报，并对一些秘密集团的首领提出起诉——尽管陪审团对此反应不太积极，并有怜悯之意。,"It is true that the Conservative government, under proddings from Queen Victoria and the Duke of Wellington, used troops, opened private correspondence in search of information, and prosecuted some of the leaders for conspiracy, though the jury responded leniently."
4136,保守党人的政府还利用这个机会对当时的激进刊物发动了一次进攻。,The Conservative government also used the occasion to mount an attack on the radical press of the day.
4136,在这个时代的开始和结束一直拥有很大势力的辉格党人，则抱着更为宽容的态度。,"The Whigs, who were in power at the beginning and the end of this period, were much more lenient."
4137,控制反人道的战争和犯罪的规则体系主要针对的是战争中反人民的暴力犯罪。,The rule systems governing warfare and crimes against humanity are mainly concerned with the perpetration of violence against people during war.
4137,但是，许多针对个人的暴力迫害的形式以及许多权力滥用的形式并非发生在公开的战争行为之中。,"However, many forms of violence perpetrated against individuals, and many forms of abuse of power, do not take place during declared acts of war."
4137,事实上，最近已认为，战争与和平之间的区別，以及压迫与反抗之间的区别，已被变化的暴力模式消蚀了（Kaldor，1998）。,"In fact, it has recently been argued that the distinctions between war and peace, and between aggression and repression, are eroded by changing patterns of violence (Kaldor, 1998)."
4138,从美国来看，社会、经济和国家机器军事化的结果，代表了一种对正常和平状态的历史性背离。,"In the case of the US the resultant militarization of society, the economy and the state apparatus represented a historic departure from normal peacetime conditions."
4138,当艾森豪威尔总统警告军事工业联合体的危险时，他说出了许多人的担忧，这些人担心为战争进行的不屈不挠的准备会腐蚀美国的民主制度和生活方式（Brodie，1973，第290页）。,"When President Eisenhower warned of the dangers of the military-industrial complex he voiced the concerns of many who feared the corruption of American democracy and the American way of life from the unrelenting preparation for war (Brodie, 1973, p. 290)."
4138,随着冷战的结束，美国和欧洲社会经历了社会、经济和政治生活的“非军事化”，其历史影响还远远没有完全显现出来。,"With the demise of the Cold War, American and European societies have experienced a significant demilitarization of social, economic and political life, the historical consequences of which are still far from completely evident."
4139,从第二次世界大战开始，现代民族国家成为全球政治统治的主要类型。,Since the Second World War the modern nation-state has become the principal type of political rule across the globe.
4139,随着非殖民地化运动的开展和苏联帝国的瓦解，民族国家的数目急剧增长。,
4139,,"With decolonization and the collapse of the Soviet empire the number of nation-states has grown rapidly (see figure 1.1 below, p. 54)."
4139,而且，现代民族国家获得了一种特殊的政治形式——它的主要变量具体化为自由民主或代议制民主。,"Moreover, the modern nation-state has acquired a particular political form - its main variant has crystallized as liberal or representative democracy."
4140,在冷战冲突之外，战后的另一个重要特征就是非殖民化。,
4140,,"In addition to the Cold War conflict, the postwar era was characterized by decolonization."
4140,第二次世界大战之后，欧洲的殖民帝国基本都解体了，获得解放的非洲、亚洲和中东地区都成为主权国家。,"After World War II, the colonial empires of the European states were largely dissolved, and the liberated territories of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East emerged as sovereign states."
4140,到20世纪80年代后期，全世界大约160个主权国家正融为一个全球共同体。,"By the late 1980s, the approximately 160 sovereign states of the world would become an emerging global community."
4141,全球化改变着权力的组织、分配以及实施。,"Globalization transforms the organization, distribution and exercise of power."
4141,在这方面，不同历史时代的全球化可能与全球分层化的不同模式有关。,"In this respect, globalization in different epochs may be associated with distinctive patterns of global stratification."
4141,在勾画全球化历史形态的过程中，需要特别注意分层化的模式。,"In mapping historical forms of globalization, specific attention needs to be paid to patterns of stratification."
4142,领主—封臣关系总体上是自由民之间的荣誉关系，并无任何奴役的含义。,"At all levels, the lord-vassal relationship was always an honorable relationship between free men and did not imply any sense of servitude."
4142,鉴于9世纪外敌冲击之下国家分崩离析，国王无法提供安全保障，分封制迅速扩展。,"Since kings could no longer provide security in the midst of the breakdown created by the invasions of the ninth century, the practice of subinfeudation became ever more widespread."
4142,由于领主拥有司法权，采邑制赋予了领主事实上的政府权利。,"With their rights of jurisdiction, fiefs gave lords virtual possession of the rights of government."
4143,在此过程中形成的全球生产网络或系统涉及的不是直接所有权，而是相当规范的契约关系。,In the process global production networks or systems are created which involve not direct ownership but rather regularized contractual relationships.
4143,但同样，一国内的中小企业可以通过特许权经营、与其他中小企业合作或者在其中进行有价证券投资等形式向国外扩展，以形成全球生产和销售链。,"But equally SMEs in one country may expand abroad through franchising, or cooperative arrangements with or portfolio investment in other SMEs to form global production and distribution chains."
4143,虽然大的跨国公司一直倾向于控制全球生产和分配系统，但现在并不一定如此。,Although big MNCs have tended to dominate global production and distribution systems this is no longer necessarily the case.
4144,如果将我们的全球化概念模式应用到世界宗教上，那么，我们可以认为，世界宗教已经具有极大的广度。,"Applying our conceptual model of globalization to the world religions, we can argue that they have assumed an extraordinary extensity."
4144,尽管世界宗教的创立可以向前提早几千年，但是我们可以将它们最初的影响浓缩到从公元前300年到公元700年之间约1000年内：佛教和印度教在耶稣诞生前3个世纪就出现了类似当代形式的形式，而伊斯兰教到公元700年时已经到达了它的核心地区。,"Although the foundation of world religions stretches back over a number of millennia, we can compress their initial impact to around a thousand-year period between 300 BCE and 700 CE.Buddhism and Hinduism assumed something like their contemporary form in the three centuries before Jesus's birth, while Islam had reached its core regions by about 700 CE."
4144,在这1000年的时间内，宗教扩张的主要载体是有组织的牧师等级制度。,
4145,另外，因为贸易在原则上为一国创造了净福利收入，收益者能够补偿受损者的损失，而且会使其更富有。,"Moreover, since trade in principle produces a net welfare gain for a country, the gainers could compensate the losers and still be better off."
4145,从这一点来说，较为开放的经济一般都是具有更广泛福利的国家是不足为奇的（Rodrik，1997）。,"In this light it is not surprising that more open economies generally have more extensive welfare states (Rodrik, 1997)."
4145,然而，贸易增长和贸易结构变化日益限制着发达资本主义国家在福利提供上的作用。,
4145,,"Nevertheless, the growth of trade and changes in the structure of trade have placed increasing strains on the welfare role of SIACS."
4146,妇女参政论者有一个基本目标：女性在民族国家中的完全的公民权。,Suffragists had one basic aim: women's full citizenship in the nation-state.
4146,英国的妇女运动是欧洲最有影响、最活跃的。,The British women' movement was the most vocal and most active in Europe.
4146,艾米琳•潘克赫斯特 （1858—1928）和她的女儿克里斯贝特尔•潘克赫斯特和西里维亚•潘克赫斯特于1903年建立了妇女社会政治联盟，这是一个主要招收中产阶级和上层阶级妇女的组织。,"Emmeline Pankhurst (1858--1928) and her daughters, Christabel and Sylvia, founded the Women’s Social and Political Union, which enrolled mostly middle- and upper-class women, in 1903."
4147,事情发生在1771年，即路易十五临终前不夂，这如同捅了马蜂窝，立即遭到了强烈的反对。,"The incident took place in 1771, shortly before the death of Louis XV and at once stirred up a hornet's nest of opposition."
4147,在贵族的领导下，反对者们通过天赋人权、个人自由与政治解放，甚至社会契约等口号表达了自己反对废除合法接受贿赂以及反对废除官职买卖的意愿。,"Led by the nobility, the opposition expressed itself in terms of the natural rights of man, freedom of the individual and political liberty, even the social contract."
4147,伏尔泰看透了这个骗局并且支持了莫普。,Voltaire saw through the sham and supported Maupeou.
4147,在任何情况下，伏尔泰都痛恨高等法院这个不仅迫害自己也迫害了象他这样的文人的镇压机构。,In any case he detested parlements as the persecutors not only of Calas but also of literary men such as himself.
4148,在古典金本位鼎盛之时，资本流动的强度达到了只有最近时期才能超过的水平。,"At the height of the classical Gold Standard era, the intensity of capital flows attained levels which have been surpassed only in more recent times."
4148,世界帝国的存在和通信技术的进步大大扩展了“高级金融”的范围。,The existence of worldwide empires and the technological advances in communications greatly expanded the reach of 'haute finance'.
4148,在此期间，几乎没有国家被排除在世界金融市场的运作之外。,Few economies in this period remained insulated from the operation of a world capital market.
4149,德川后期农民社会的政治含义似乎非常明确。,The political implications of late Tokugawa peasant society seem fairly obvious.
4149,人们显然不能作这样的解释，即在这大规模骚乱的时期没有爆发全面的农民革命，是由于家产非常平均的结果。,Clearly one cannot explain the absence of full scale peasant revolution in these fairiy turbulent times as a consequence of rough equality in holdings.
4149,也不能解释成是由于没有财产的人与占有财产的人订有一系列的契约，才维持了稳定的局面。,"Rather, it was the series of bonds that connected those without property to those who possessed it that helped to maintain stability."
4150,但到了公元前2世纪时，帝国的形成开始弱化传统价值观。,"By the second century B.C., however, the assembling of an empire had begun to weaken the old values."
4150,罗马人开始关注势力、地位和财产。,"The Romans began to focus more on affluence, status, and material possessions."
4150,他们转向注重个人主义，摈弃曾让罗马昌盛的集体福祉。,"Emphasis shifted toward individualism and away from collective well-being, the old public spirit that had served Rome so well."
4151,关于军备控制的最早记录是1139年拉特兰公会的决议，它禁止基督教军队之间使用弩（Contamine，1984，第274页）。,"One of the earliest recorded arms control initiatives is the decision of the Lateran Council in 1139 to prohibit the use of crossbows between Christian armies (Contamine, 1984, p. 274)."
4151,这一举措像多数军备控制和裁军努力一样，证明只具有暂时的、有限的作用。,
4151,,"This prohibition, like most arms control and disarmament initiatives, proved to have a very temporary and limited impact."
4151,但是，它标志着国家之间试图管制（和预防）战争武器的获得、扩散、使用和部署的平淡无奇的历史开端。,"Nevertheless, it represents the beginning of a somewhat uninspiring history of interstate attempts to regulate (and prevent) the acquisition, diffusion, use and deployment of the instruments of war."
4152,公地在欧洲更重要，这里放牧的牲畜减轻了人类的负担。但亚洲也有公共土地，象日本，公共地是肥料等补充资源的来源。,"Though commons are more important in Europe where cattle took some of the burden off human shoulders, they have existed also in Asia; for example, in Japan as a source of supplementary resources such as fertilizer."
4152,尽管存在着形形色色的农村类型，然而与这种状况相适应的主要思想很清楚，每个社会成员都应得到足够的资源，从而有能力履行对社会的义务。,"Despite considerable variation, the main idea connected with these arrangements stands out very clearly: every member of the community should have access to enough resources to be able to perform obligations to the community carrying on a collective struggle for survival."
4152,为生存进行群体性的斗争，每个人，包括领主和牧师，也都应有所贡献。,"Everyone, including the lord and the priest, has a contribution to make."
4152,这种观念被各类知识分子理想化了，但在农民的经验事实中始终有着竖实的基础。,"Romanticized by a variety of intellectuals, these notions have nevertheless a firm basis in the facts of peasant experience."
4153,这种公司内贸易产生了无数的标准和资料收集问题；这些问题在一定程度上要视决定同一公司内买卖双方属何种商业关系的标准而定，特别是近20年来，人们已目睹了除全球附属公司外的一系列制度安排的出现。,"This intrafirm trade presents numerous measurement and data collection problems; these turn partly on the criteria for deciding what kind of commercial relationship between the buyer and seller constitutes being within the same firm, particularly as the last twenty years have witnessed the emergence of a variety of institutional arrangements beyond simply wholly owned subsidiaries."
4153,官方机构常常无法系统地收集公司内贸易的资料。,Official agencies often do not systematically collect data on intrafirm trade.
4153,总之，即使如此，这些估计的数据也是基本一致的：本图里和深作（1993）发现，几个经合发国家1/4到1/3的贸易是在公司内进行的。,"Overall, though, the estimated figures are broadly consistent: Bonturi and Fukasaku (1993) found that for several OECD countries between a quarter and a third of their trade is now intrafirm."
4153,联合国贸易与发展组织（UNCTAD，1995，第23页）和经合发组织（OECD，1993c）都估计公司内贸易相当于世界贸易的大约1/3。,"UNCTAD (1995, p. 23) and OECD (1993c) both estimated that intrafirm trade accounted for around a third of world trade."
4154,激进分子的领导人物视战争为进步的资本主义同建立在奴隶制基础上的反动农业社会制度之间的革命性抗衡。,Leading members of this group perceived the war as a revolutionary struggle between a progressive capitalism and a reactionary agrarian society based on slavery.
4154,正因为南北两方的冲突有如此性质，以致一些最重要的南北斗争实际上均发生于战后。这是激进共和党人一手造成的。,"To the extent that the conflict between the North and the South really had such a character, a conflict some of whose most important struggles came after the actual fighting stopped, this was due to the Radical Republicans."
4154,从100年以后的观点来看，这些人严格来说代表了资产阶级革命火花的最后闪烁，是中世纪市民发动反对封建领主暴动的最后继承者。,"From the perspective of a hundred years later, they appear as the last revolutionary flicker that is strictly bourgeois and strictly capitalist, the last successors to medieval townsmen beginning the revolt against their feudal overlords."
4154,内战以后的革命运动中，既有反资本主义分子，又有法西斯主义分子和支持资本主义的反革命分子。,"Revolutionary movements since the Civil War have been either anticapitalist, or fascist and counterrevolutionary if in support of capitalism."
4155,虽然国际股票在跨国股票流量中地位显著，但流量的较大来源出现在国内投资者在国外股票市场上购买股票的情况下。这样的股票仅在其地方股票交易所发行，但外国投资者可以而且确定购买了这些股票。,"Although international equities are significant in cross-border equity flows, a much larger source of flows arises where investors in one country buy shares on foreign stock markets; such shares may only be issued on their local stock exchanges, but foreign investors can and do purchase them."
4155,跨国股票总流量已经从80年代后期的1万亿多美元上升到90年代中期的大约2.5万亿美元（国际货币基金组织，1995，第189页）。,"Gross cross-border equity flows have risen from over $1 trillion in the late 1980s to around $2.5 trillion in the mid-1990s (IMF, 1995, p. 189)."
4156,到1857年，严重的财政危机出现了。,In 1857 came a serious financial crash.
4156,这一年通过了一项关税，它反映了南方当时的压力，却未能减轻这种压力，反倒减少了以上两方面的关税。,"A tariff passed in that year, reflecting Southern pressures, gave no relief and actually reduced duties in these two areas."
4156,这事竟没有在北方工业界引起强烈不满，其原因之一也许是随即而至的是经济繁荣、工业迅速发展的时期。,"Partly because they followed a period of prosperity and rapid growth, it seems, these events aroused sullen indignation in Northern industrial circles."
4157,让我们把对农民地位的适当讨论暂且放在一边，我们或许会注意到军阀时期某些更一般的特征。,"Leaving the position of the peasantry aside for discussion at an appropriate point, we may notice certain more general features of the warlord era."
4157,赋税制度代表了乡绅后裔与官贵阶层的政治关系，这种势力产生并扶持着经济势力，经济势力又反过来制造出新的政治力量。,"The system of requisitions represented a continuation of the gentrys relation to politics under the mandarinate, whereby political power begat and supported economic power to generate political power once more."
4157,随着中央政权的消失，上层地主阶级失去了使中国社会维系在旧有模式中的主要工具，这种工具如果不受损害的话是会再次起作用的。,"With the disappearance of the central government, the landed upper class lost one of the main mechanisms that had helped to keep Chinese society in its ancient mold, if by no means unmarred by serious cracks and rifts."
4158,第二次世界大战后，跨国公司广泛利用其竞争优势，并获得了长足进展。,
4158,,MNCs have grown in the postwar period because they have exploited their competitive advantages internationally.
4158,在某些情况下，这些竞争优势源自规模经济、卓越的管理或世界性的销售网。,"In some cases, these competitive advantages derive from economies of scale and scope, superior management techniques and/or worldwide sales networks."
4158,但是战后跨国公司竞争优势的主要来源是技术创新（Cantwell，L989；Clegg，1987）。,"But the key source of competitive advantage for MNCs in the postwar period has been technological innovation (Cantwell, 1989; Clegg, 1987)."
4159,虽然某些贸易城市已经存在几个世纪了，怛是在相对封闭的中国和日本经济之外，其他城市的成长和繁荣常常是与不断增长的贸易联系在一起的。,"While certain trading cities had existed for centuries, outside of the relatively closed economies of China and Japan the growth and increased prosperity of other cities was often connected with rising trade."
4159,因为自身内部工业和商业的繁荣，这些城市具备了发展的经济动力。,These cities developed an economic dynamic as industry and commerce flourished within them.
4159,贸易就其本性来说，能够提高不同地区间市场关系的广度和深度。,Trade by its very nature tended to increase the extensity and intensity of market relations between different regions.
4160,一些发展中国家生产标准化和技能的提高，使一半以上的电视生产建立在经合发国家以外。,Standardization of production and rising skill levels in some developing countries have led to over half the world's television production being located outside the OECD.
4160,电子工业以生产的规模经济著称，所以生产是相对集中的，但提供零部件的低成本生产商又是分散的。,The industry is characterized by high scale economies in assembly so that assembly is geographically concentrated but with geographically dispersed sourcing of component parts from low cost producers.
4160,日本和后来的韩国生产商已经在东亚建立了生产网络，零部件生产由低工资国家的分支机构和分包商负责，组装则在经合发国家。,"Japanese and, latterly, Korean producers have established production networks in East Asia, with assembly in OECD countries and component production, by affiliates or subcontractors, in lower wage economies."
4161,尽管与伊丽莎白时代和早期斯图亚特王朝时代相比，18世纪资产阶级和土地贵族的联盟业已削弱，但是，他们之间始终保持着密切的联系。,"Although the interlocking between the bourgeoisie and the landed aristocracy was less in the eighteenth century than under Elizabeth and the early Stuarts, the connection between the two remained very close."
4161,正如莱维斯纳米尔爵士所注意到的，18世纪英国的统治阶层并不是“平均地权”主张者，这一点和同时代的德国的情况不同。,"As Sir Lewis Namier has observed, the English ruling classes in the eighteenth century were not ""agrarians"" like their contemporaries in Germany, while the civilization they created was neither urban nor rural."
4161,他们所创造的文明既不是都市化的也不是田园式的，他们既不居住于坚固的城堡中，也不居住于釆邑的住宅里，更不位于城市的府邸内（象意大利那样），而是居住于建造于自己土地上的建筑物里。,"They lived neither in fortified castles nor in manor houses, nor in town palaces (as in Italy), but in mansions planted on their estates."
4162,关于王政复古的原因，作出以下一般性概括似乎更有说服力。,At this point it may be helpful to assess in more general terms the causes of the Restoration.
4162,我以为最根本的原因，是商品经济的兴起已对封建大厦造成局部侵蚀，而商品经济也正是由于安定和秩序的确定才得以发展起来。,"The fundamental one, I believe, was the partial erosion of the feudal edifice through the rise of commerce, which was in turn due to the establishment of peace and order."
4162,这种侵蚀与外国的入侵结合在一起，使得王政复古成为解决这一问题的重要一环。,"Together with the foreign intrusion, this erosion created problems toward whose solution the Restoration was one important step."
4162,这种解决方法在政治上的反动性，在很大程度上可以根据这一运动所吸引的集团作出解释。,The politically reactionary aspects of the solution are to a great extent explicable in terms of the groups that the Imperial movement attracted.
4162,这些集团之一是天皇宫廷中的一部分贵族；另一组成部分是封建体制极强的诸藩中心怀不满的首领。,"One was a section of the nobility at the Imperial court.Another, consisted of a few disaffected leaders of fiefs where feudal institutions appear to have been particularly strong."
4163,他们最初的政治优势地位可能源于他们作为大地主拥有财富。,Their initial prominence was probably due to their wealth as great landowners.
4163,这样贵族就构成了贵族统治集团。,Thus patricians constituted an aristocratic governing class.
4163,贵族和平民都可以投票，但只有贵族才能当选政府官员。,"Both patricians and plebeians could vote, but only the patricians could be elected to governmental offices."
4164,斯托斯基 指出：“许多美国人最自豪的武器——从先进的中程空对空导弹到M-1坦克——没有商业化的先进的日本机器工具是无法完成的”（1992，第137页）。,"Stowsky notes that ‘many of America’s most vaunted weapons - from the AMRAAM missile to the M-l tank - literally could not be built without commercially developed Japanese machine tools' (1992, p. 137)."
4164,重要的是不要夸大这种跨国化规模，因为尽管没有可比较数据，但是可能在欧洲、发展中世界，甚至日本情况相对不严重。,"It is important not to exaggerate the scale of this transnationalization for, although there are no comparative figures, it is probably the case that it is relatively less significant than in Europe, the developing world, or even Japan."
4164,尽管事实是明显的，但关键一点是：像美国国会技术评估办公室最近报苦所说的那样，跨国化问题对于美国防务制定者和国防工业来说是全新的事情（OTA，1991，第38 页）。,"Although qualifications are in order, a key point remains: the problem of transnationalization, as a recent OTA report observed, is a completely new experience for US defence planners and the defence industry (OTA, 1991, p. 38)."
4165,与这种重组相伴的是国防工业的逐渐私有化，以及还有前面部分所提到的，国防工业基础逐步转为民用。,"Alongside this restructuring is an evolving privatization of the defence business and, as noted in the previous section, a growing civilianization of the DIB."
4165,政府，特别是大多数的第二层次的供应商，如欧洲人，面临一个严重的国防生产困境：名义上，为了支持一种符合成本效益的军事能力，国防工业基础应该逐步跨国化，从而成为“国防工业基础”和“国防”的核心内容（Buzan， 1991，参见第8章）。,"Governments, most particularly second-tier suppliers such as the Europeans, are confronted by an acute defence production dilemma: namely, that in order to sustain a cost-effective military capability the national DIB has to be progressively transnationalized, so compromising the very notion of a national DIB and national defence (Buzan, 1991; see chapter 8)."
4165,这一点使得军事技术革命进一步强化，因为“新的和更先进的常规武器有着双重效果， 一方面增加了防御的成本，另一方面提高了‘进口依赖’的安全后果”（Haglund，1989，第245页）。,"This is reinforced further by the impact of the MTR since 'newer and smarter conventional weapons ... have the dual effect of raising the costs of defence and elevating... the security consequences of import-dependence’（Haglund，1989, p. 245)."
4166,国防政策制定，从防御战略决策到军事力量的部署与运用，被牢牢镶嵌于一个机制矩阵中，这些机制是官方和非官方的、双边和多边的咨询和合作机制。,"National defence policy-making, from decisions about defence strategy to the deployment and use of military force, is embedded in a matrix of institutionalized bilateral and multilateral consultative and cooperative mechanisms, both official and unofficial."
4166,几乎没有一种国防政策的因素仍然保持完全不为这些发展所影响，甚至情报机构也发展出它们自己的机构间对话形式。,Few aspects of national security policy remain totally untouched by these developments; even intelligence agencies have developed their own forms of interagency dialogue.
4166,尽管作为一个军事超级强国，美国似乎在军事领域拥有最大（相对的）的自主权，但这实际上忽略了一个简单的事实，那就是美国作为欧洲和太平洋军事安全部署的枢纽，它的军事自主由于它所卷入的军事安排及承诺的网络而被削弱。,"Although, as a military superpower, the US appears to retain the greatest (relative) autonomy in the military domain, this is to overlook the simple fact that as the linchpin of European and Pacific military-security arrangements, its military autonomy is decidedly compromised by the web of military commitments and arrangements in which it has become entangled."
4167,第二，已经有人反对国际法主要是针对政治和地缘政治事务这一信条。,"Second, opinion has moved against the doctrine that international law is primarily about political and geopolitical affairs."
4167,根据这一新的概念，国际法越来越关注于协调和规制经济、社会、通信以及环境事务。,"According to this new conception, international law is concerned increasingly with coordinating and regulating economic, social, communication and environmental matters."
4167,与国际政治中的行动者和机构——例如，联合国、世界银行，国际电信联盟、联合国粮食及农业组织，以及世界卫生组织——的数目的不断膨胀相连，扩大国际法范畴的压力也在不断增加。,"Linked to the substantial expansion in the number of actors and agencies in world politics - for example, the United Nations itself, the World Bank, the International Telecommunication Union, the Food and Agricultural Organization and the World Health Organization - there have been many pressures to increase the scope of international law."
4168,众多的政府间组织、国际条约、国际非政府组织等主要是战后出现的现象（见第1章）。,"The enormous number of intergovernmental organizations, international treaties, international non-governmental organizations, etc., is primarily a postwar phenomenon (see chapter 1)."
4168,同样，当代全球化的分层模式与以前也有明显的区别。,"Similarly, the pattern of stratification of contemporary globalization is quite distinct from that of earlier eras."
4168,首先，不同形式的全球化汇合在一起，创造出各种不平等和等级模式。,"In the first place, the enormous confluence of different forms of globalization has created variegated patterns of unevenness and hierarchy."
4169,80年代以来，伴随着贸易壁垒的广泛减少，发展中国家发生了一系列变化。这些变化既是其国内战略，又是多边组织如世界银行、国际货币基金组织和世贸组织压力所致。,"From the 1980s there has been a sea change among developing countries, with widespread reductions in trade barriers, undertaken both as a domestic strategy and under pressure from multilateral institutions like the World Bank, the IMF and WTO."
4169,萨克斯和华纳（1995）发现，从60年代到80年代后期，在全世界范围内，采取广义的贸易开放政策的经济体在人口数量上稳定在不足世界人口总量的1/4，国内生产总值不足世界国内生产总值的一半。,Sachs and Warner (1995) found that from 1960 until the late 1980s the proportion of the world's economies that could be classed as operating broadly open trade policies was stable at below a quarter measured by population and less than a half measured by GDP.
4170,日本和美国移民机构都称遣返率约为20%。,Both Japanese and American agencies report return rates of about 20 per cent.
4170,国际劳工组织估计，尽管作了这些努力，德国1991年的非法移民数为65万，意大利为60万，整个西欧也许达到260万（Bohning，1991）。,"Despite these efforts, the ILO estimates that there were 650,000 illegal immigrants in Germany in 1991 and 600,000 in Italy, and perhaps 2.6 million in Western Europe as a whole (Bohning,1991)."
4170,单单在南加利福尼亚的非法移民数也许比这还要多。,There are probably more illegals in southern California alone than this.
4171,早期的联盟形式是列强之间用于应付紧迫性威胁的双边或三边条约。,Early alliance formations were bilateral or trilateral pacts between the great powers designed to meet immediate threats.
4171,它们多为非常灵活的协议，因为各国经常根据新的国际环境而改变自己的联盟伙伴。,They tended to be very flexible arrangements in that states frequently changed alliance partners in response to new international conditions.
4171,这些条约秘密地运作或包含有秘密的任务，由于这些原因被国际联盟的设计师伍德罗•威尔逊总统所憎恶。,"Such pacts operated in secret or involved secret undertakings and were abhorred for that very reason by President Woodrow Wilson, the main architect of the League of Nations."
4172,在自然科学中，激进的生物学家和生态学家都认为，应该将地球看作是一个相互依赖的完整的生态系统，如半神秘的大地女神理论或鲜为人知的地球太空船理论；许多不太激进的人认为，整个地球受到环境变迁的威胁，从地理范围上来讲，环境变迁的原因及其带来的结果都是全球性的。,"In the sciences, radical biologists and ecologists have argued for conceiving the planet as an interdependent holistic ecosystem, be it the semi-mystic Gaia theory or the less prosaic spaceship earth; many less radical voices would accept that the entire planet is threatened by environmental changes whose origins and consequences are geographically widespread."
4172,在进行这些争论的同时，除了环境运动和组织之间复杂的国际联盟得到长足发展外，对环境进行调控的国际机构、法律与条约的数量和范围也呈现了巨幅增长。,"Paralleling these debates, there has been an enormous growth in the number and scope of international institutions, laws and treaties that regulate the environment alongside the development of complex international alliances of environmental movements and organizations."
4172,由于我们将全球化定义为区域之间或跨洲际的社会过程和社会互动，因此，将这个定义运用到环境问题上时必须注意4个限制条件。,"Given our definition of globalization as social processes and interactions that assume interregional or transcontinental proportions, four qualifications are necessary in applying it to environmental questions."
4173,世界外国直接投资存量的大约55%集中在初级产品部门，大约15%集中于制造业，其余的则集中于公共事业和服务业——主要是金融和贸易公司。,"Around 55 per cent of world FDI stocks were in the primary product sector, around 15 per cent in manufacturing and the rest in utilities and services - mainly banking and trading companies."
4173,外国直接投资集中在初级产品部门意味着跨国公司对全部制造业活动的一小部分份额负责。所以，国际生产的程度有限。,The concentration of FDI in primary products meant that MNCs were responsible for small shares of overall manufacturing activity such that there was only a limited degree of international production.
4174,在1991年，运行中的200颗卫星中有1/3是由国际通信卫星组织掌握并由许多国家共享的。,Another third of the 200 satellites in operation in 1991 were operated by INTELSAT and shared by many nations.
4174,具有重要意义的另外一个独立的发射计划是由前苏联完成的，它拥有全球约15%的卫星，但是，欧洲和其他一些国家如印度和巴西也正在制定自己的计划。,"The only other independent launch programme of significance came from the former Soviet Union with around 15 per cent of satellites, but Europe, and some countries such as India and Brazil, are developing their own programmes."
4174,在70年代，卫星开始取代海洋电缆成为国际通信方式并不令人吃惊（Brunn和Leinbach，1991;Staple，1991）。,"Not surprisingly, satellites began to displace maritime cables for international communications in the 1970s (Brunn and Leinbach, 1991; Staple, 1991)."
4175,另外，为了应付各种银行破产和空前数量的国际金融交易，国内金融当局已经广泛合作以为国际银行业建立一个共同的框架。,"Moreover, in response to various banking failures and the unprecedented volume of international financial transactions, national financial authorities have cooperated extensively over the establishment of a common framework for international banking."
4175,结果，现在国际上普遍同意了国际清算银行调控的银行资本充足率（银行必须有资本储备以作为避免损失的缓冲器）。,"As a result, there is now a general international agreement on bank capital adequacy (the capital reserves banks have to keep as a cushion against losses) monitored by the Bank for International Settlements."
4175,还要有一个国际银行业监管机构以清楚地区分国内责任。,There is also an internationalized banking supervision structure with clearly demarcated national responsibilities.
4176,从全球范围来看，联合国的维和行动和集体安全会议变得越来越普遍，虽然它们并不一定非常有效。,"At the global level, too, the peacekeeping activities of the UN and its more general collective security functions have become more visible, although not necessarily more effective."
4176,这些发展反映了这样一种意识，即随着冷战的结束，和面对当前军事技术变革的背景，“国家防御外部武装力量对其地域疆界攻击的能力”减弱了（Cammilleri和Falk， 1992， 第152页）。,"These developments reflect a realization that with the end of the Cold War, and against the background of recent military technological change, ""the capacity of the state to defend territorial boundaries against armed attack"" may have weakened (Cammilleri and Falk, 1992, p. 152)."
4176,理所当然，许多国家认识到单靠一个国家的单边行动无法实现国家的安全。,"Certainly, many states now recognize that national security can no longer be achieved simply through unilateral actions alone."
4177,另一方面.随着全球化的加强，它产生了社会经济活动重新领土化的压力。这些活动的形式包括次国家的、区域性的、超国家的经济区，治理机制以及文化复合体。全球化也强化了社会的“本土化”和“国家化”。,"On the other hand, as globalization intensifies it generates pressures towards a reterritorialization of socio-economic activity in the form of subnational, regional and supranational economic zones, mechanisms of governance and cultural complexes.It may also reinforce the 'localization' and 'nationalization' of societies."
4177,因此，全球化涉及到政治经济权力复杂的解领土化和再领土化。,"Accordingly, globalization involves a complex deterritorialization and reterritorialization of political and economic power."
4178,结果是，联合国最终在冷战中作为一个自主的行动者在许多紧迫的问题上受到牵制（参见Falk，1975a，第169〜196页，1975b，第69〜72页；Cassese，1986，第142〜143、200〜201、213〜214、246〜250页）。,"As a result, the UN was virtually immobilized during the Cold War as an autonomous actor on many pressing issues (see Falk, 1975a, pp. 169-96, 1975b, pp. 69-72; Cassese, 1986, pp. 142-3, 200-1,213-14,246-50)."
4178,此外，宪章重新给予必要时进行“自卫”的单边军事行动以特许（通过第51条），因为对这一词的含义并没有清楚的界定。,"Moreover, the Charter gave renewed credence (through Article 51) to unilateral military action if it was necessary in 'self-defence', since there was no clear delimitation of the meaning of this phrase."
4178,所以，在某些方面，宪章的框架代表了国家间体系的一种扩张。,"In certain respects, therefore, the Charter framework represents an extension of the interstate system."
4179,可以肯定，俄国从面对同样压力到中央政权的实际崩溃所经过的时间更短。,There was to be sure a brief period in the Russian response to somewhat similar stresses when the central government in effect disappeared.
4179,但在俄国，从社会发展的基本趋势看，崩溃时期只能算做一个小小的插曲。,"But in Russia, from the perspective of fundamental social trends, this period of collapse was scarcely more than an episode."
4179,相反在中国，接近无政府状态的阶段持续了相当长的一段时期。,"In China, on the other hand, the final period of near anarchy lasted much longer."
4179,最短也可以从1991年宣布成立共和国到1927年国民党取得表面上的胜利为止。,"As a minimum, one might date it from the proclamation of the Republic in 1911 to the formal victory of the Kuomintang in 1927."
4180,贸易强度千差万別。,The intensity of trade varied widely.
4180,发达国家和初级产品出口国的贸易从无到有，直至占到其国民收入的很大部分。,"For the developed countries and major primary exporters, trade grew from negligible to significant proportions of their national income."
4180,许多其他国家的贸易程度很低，它们对其他经济的影响也是有限的。,"For many other economies, trade levels were often small and their impact on the rest of the economy limited."
4181,一国国际收支的现金账户是它的（公共和私人）储蓄和投资之差：在政府成功地平衡现金账户的情况下，储蓄和投资是相等的。,The current account of a country's balance of payments is the difference between its (public and private) savings and its investment: savings and investment are equalized where the government succeeds in balancing the current account.
4181,因为国家不可能永久地保持现金账户赤字或盈余，所以，政府就试图平衡现金账户。结果，国内储蓄和投资率趋于统一 （Krol 1996； Liu和Tanner， 1996）。,"Since economies cannot sustain current account deficits or surpluses permanently, governments seek to balance the current account, with the consequence that national savings and investment rates tend to converge (Krol, 1996; Liu and Tanner, 1996)."
4181,在这方面，国内储蓄和投资的相关性并不是一个整合的全球资本市场存在与否的最终测试标准。,In this respect the correlation between national savings and investment is not a conclusive test of the existence (or non-existence) of an integrated global capital market.
4182,早期的哈里发统洽着麦地那一带，将他们新征服的地带编入纳税的行省中。,"Early caliphs, ruling from Medina, organized their newly conquered territories into taxpaying provinces."
4182,到7世纪中期，围绕先知的继承问题再起争端。直到661年，穆罕默德的女婿阿里被杀，叙利亚省的长官，阿里的主要对手之一，大将莫瓦亚继任哈里发，争端才暂时停息。,"By the mid-seventh century, problems arose again over the succession to the Prophet until Ali, Muhammad's son-in-law, was assassinated and the general Muawiya, the governor of Syria and one of Ali's chief rivals, became caliph in 661."
4183,因为存在贸易保护壁垒，运输成本降低，消费需求增强，所以，借助海外生产比出口更容易满足外国市场需求。,"Given protectionist barriers, declining transport costs and growing consumer demand, it was often easier to supply foreign markets through overseas production than by exports."
4183,美国的跨国公司以其技术优势为基础继续在一系列部门扩张。,US multinationals continued to expand on the basis of their technological superiority across a range of sectors.
4183,第二次世界大战后，一些欧洲公司在特殊的工业部门保持和发展着竞争优势。70年代，在某些部门，欧洲和日本公司的生产力水平赶上了美国公司。,"Some European firms sustained and developed competitive advantages in particular industries after the war, and during the 1970s European and Japanese companies achieved similar levels of productivity to those of the US in some sectors."
4184,亚洲范围内的迁移模式呈现出类似的全球性和区域性迁移流相结合的趋势（Fawcett和Cariño，1987；Skeldon，1992；Fong，1993）。,"Patterns of migration within Asia show a similar combination of global and regional flows (Fawcett and Cariño, 1987; Skeldon, 1992; Fong, 1993)."
4184,在70年代以前，除了那些朝向经合组织成员国的迁移以外，迁移水平是很低的。,"Prior to the 1970s, levels of migration, other than those to OECD countries, were low."
4184,在70年代，迁移流不断加速，但迁移目的地从欧洲转向了北美，澳大利亚以及上面提到的海湾国家。,"In the 1970s migratory flows accelerated but shifted from European destinations to North America, Australia and, as noted above, to the Gulf states."
4185,美国的海洋环境极具特色。,The USA has a quite distinctive pattern of marine environment.
4185,东部和西部有着漫长的海岸线，毗邻大西洋和太平洋。,To the east and west it has very long seaboards-the Atlantic and Pacific.
4185,在北部，在阿拉斯加海岸的附近，美国拥有北冰洋，而其惟一重要的区域性半封闭的海位于南部，也就是墨西哥湾。,"In the north, off the Alaskan coast, the USA shares the Arctic Ocean, while to the south lies the only significant regional, semi-enclosed sea on to which the USA borders, the Gulf of Mexico."
4186,这个时期，瑞典、瑞士和日本的公司也开始了对外直接投资。,"This period also witnessed the emergence of FDI by Swedish, Swiss and Japanese firms."
4186,今天已经在世界名列前茅的几家瑞典和瑞士的跨国公司在这一时期为利用其特殊的竞争优势建立了自己的海外机构。,Several of today's leading Swedish and Swiss MNCs established their overseas presence in this period by exploiting their specific competitive advantages.
4186,日本也开始在几个海外殖民地投资，特别是在韩国，日本建立了相当水平的制造业。,"Japan too invested abroad in  several colonies, establishing significant levels of manufacturing in Korea particularly."
4187,巴勒斯坦人也同样成了地区性移民的重要组成部分：1948年以色列的建立迫使部分巴勒斯坦人迁走，1967年对约旦河西岸的占领进一步造成巴勒斯坦人的迁移。,"Palestinians formed an equally important component of the regional diasporas: already displaced by the formation of the state of Israel in 1948, the occupation of the West Bank in 1967 displaced them further."
4187,这些迁移包括：为了寻找工作向以色列的迁移、更加永久地居住在约旦以及海湾国家的合同工。,"Migration involved movements to Israel itself on a day-by-day basis for work, as well as more permanent settlement in Jordan and contract labour in the Gulf states."
4187,10年后，黎巴嫩国内战争使犹太人被驱逐。,A decade later the Lebanese civil war generated a similar diasporic exodus.
4188,第三，在被邓宁称作“联合资本主义”的发展中（Dutming，1997），同一产业内的许多公司在一系列业务中联合经营。,"Thirdly, in a development dubbed 'alliance capitalism' by Dunning (1997), firms in the same industry are increasingly cooperating in a range of ventures."
4188,不同国家的公司间建立合资企业和一系列非股份制度安排在战后非常普遍。但如前所述，每年成立的公司数目，在最近几年已经从1990年的1760家发展到1995年的4600家（UNCTAD，1997，第12页），其中包括靠转包合同关系维持的公司，政府特许的公司，以及为生产特殊商品和进入特别市场而建立的联合股份公司等。,"Joint ventures and a range of non-equity arrangements between firms in different countries have been common in the postwar period, but, as noted earlier, the number concluded annually has jumped in recent years from 1,760 in 1990 to 4,600 in 1995 (UNCTAD, 1997, p. 12).These include subcontracting relationships and franchising, as well as cooperative ventures to develop particular products and enter specific markets."
4189,这些数字里面不包括战略联盟（不同国家负责研究开发的主要公司间建立的合作企业，可以共同开发技术）。,These figures exclude strategic alliances (that is major cooperative ventures between firms in different countries to undertake R&D and thus develop technology together).
4189,这样的联盟每年成立的数目从1991年的280家上升到1993年的430家，虽然增长率此后有所降低（UNCTAD， 1997， 第14页）。,"The number of such alliances concluded annually rose from 280 in 1991 to 430 in 1993, although the rate of increase has since slowed (UNCTAD, 1997, p. 14)."
4189,整个80年代，出现了4000多家这样的公司联盟，它们主要集中在许多高技术产业中，半数以上集中在生物技术和信息技术领域（OECD，1996a，第45页）。,"During the 1980s over 4,000 of these alliances were formed, predominately in the most technologically dynamic industries, with over half in biotechnology and information technology (OECD, 1996a, p. 45)."
4190,然而，在欧洲，联合出品在某些时候就是重要的资金来源。,"However, in Europe co-productions have at certain times been an important source of finance."
4190,合作生产1950年在法国只占受资助电影的15%，但这个比例在接下来的15年中稳步上升，在60年代中期达到了约70%。,"In France co-productions accounted for only 15 per cent of film finance projects in 1950, but this climbed steadily over the next fifteen years to reach around 70 per cent of film projects in the mid-1960s."
4190,此后该比例有所下降，到70年代晚期又回到了战后最初的水平。到80年代晚期又出现了某种程度的复苏。,"After this, the level declined and by the late 1970s had returned to its initial postwar levels, before undergoing something of a revival in the late 1980s."
4190,到90年代中期，西欧的联合出品的程度已经达到了总电影量的50%。,By the mid 1990s the level of co-productions in Western Europe had reached 50 per cent of all movies.
4190,欧洲一些国家的电影产业几乎完全依靠国际联合出品的资金，如葡萄牙和比利时就是如此（Gyory和Glas，1994;《银屏摘要》，1996，1997b）。,"Smaller European film industries like the Portuguese and Belgian are almost totally reliant on international co-production finance (Gyory and Glas, 1994; Screen Digest, 1996,1997b)."
4191,即使是冷战的结束也未能瓦解它，因为它已经扩展到将一些前华沙条约成员国包括进来（比如波兰、匈牙利和捷克共和国），并且通过和平伙伴计划，将俄罗斯、瑞典和其他欧洲国家包括进来。,"Even the ending of the Cold War has not undermined it, since it has expanded to include some former Warsaw Pact members (such as Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic) and, through the Partnership for Peace (PFP) arrangement, Russia, Sweden and other European states."
4191,无论是从其日常事物还是在国际危机时刻，北大西洋公约组织都为多边决策和军事合作提供了一种制度化的机制，从而使国家安全和军事自主的观念成为可能。,
4191,,"In both the routine conduct of its affairs and in times of international crisis, NATO provides an institutional mechanism for multilateral decision-making and military cooperation which significantly qualifies the idea of national security and military autonomy."
4191,安全不再仅仅是按照国家地理疆界的防御来进行定义，而是根据集体防御和国际安全来确定。,"Security is no longer simply defined in terms of the defence of national territorial boundaries, but rather in terms of collective defence and international security."
4192,至于跨国污染，由于工厂一直将垃圾排入河流中，加之含有矿物燃料的硫磺被燃烧，酸雨和河流污染非常严重。,"As for transboundary pollution, there have been significant levels of acid rain and riverine pollution for as long as industries have been pouring wastes into rivers and as long as sulphur containing fossil fuels has been burnt."
4192,凡是在国家边界附近发生这种现象，就一定是跨国污染。,Where this has happened near borders there has necessarily been transboundary pollution.
4192,但是，污染程度在20世纪稳步上升，以至于酸雨对森林和湖泊造成破坏的程度变得非常明显。,"But as levels of pollution steadily rose through the twentieth century, the point was reached when the level of acid rain damage to forests and lakes became very visible."
4193,核电和潜在的核危害情况明显是灾难性环境退化在范围和危险程度上的历史分水岭；而且在过去的30年中，由于越来越多的国家已经建立了越来越多的核电站，因此，这些危险也出现了集中。,The case of nuclear power and potential nuclear hazards is clearly a historical watershed in the scope and dangerous potential for catastrophic environmental degradation; and the last thirty years have seen an intensification of those risks as more and more countries have built more nuclear power stations.
4193,更重要的是，核技术的转变已经产生了复杂的再生和再循环系统，相应地，这也带来了大规模和越来越多的核废料贸易。,"Moreover, the shifts in nuclear technologies have introduced complex systems of reprocessing and recycling which have in turn generated a large-scale and growing trade in nuclear waste."
4193,很明显，这已经给跨国污染和污染威胁增加了全新且重要的维度。,This has clearly added a new and important dimension to transboundary pollution and pollution threats.
4193,在80年代，核废料国际贸易是与其他污染性垃圾的国际贸易的迅速扩张同时进行的（Greenpeace ， 1993）。,"The international trade in nuclear waste has been paralleled by a rapid expansion in the international trade of other hazardous wastes in the 1980s (Greenpeace, 1993)."
4194,一个世纪以后黑人民权运动的规模也不过如此，甚至还有所逊色。这时经济问题仍然没有受到重视。,"A century later, the movement for civil rights for the Negroes seeks no more than this, indeed not quite all that, since the economic emphasis remains muted."
4194,如果走在时代的前面算是革命的话，斯蒂文森正是这样。,"If being ahead of the times is revolutionary, Stevens was that."
4194,甚至富有同情心的北方人对此都表示震惊。,Even sympathetic Northerners professed shock.
4194,霍勒斯•格里利是《纽约论坛》编辑，他一直很同情废奴运动，他在回答斯蒂文森1865年9月6日的讲话时写道：“我们反对在南方的财产问题上交战……因为南方人中的富裕阶级要比无知和粗俗的人开明些、仁慈些，对黑人来说也为害较少。,"Horace Greeley, editor of the New York Tribune, long sympathetic to the abolitionist cause, wrote in response to Stevens*s speech of September 6, 1865, "" . . . we protest against any warfare on Southern property ... because the wealthier class of Southerners, being more enlightened and humane than the ignorant and vulgar, are less inimicable to the blacks."
4194,”格里利的这种担忧向人们暗示：当南、北方有产阶级为掩盖他们之间的分歧，采取主著名的和解办法，让黑人们去争取他们的自由这一情况发生时，会导致什么后果。,"” Greeley’s misgivings give a hint of what was to come when men of substance North and South were to bury their differences and, by another famous compromise, leave the Negroes to make what they could of their freedom."
4195,14世纪中期的黑死病是欧洲历史上最具破坏性的自然灾难。它使人口锐减，引起经济、社会、政治以及文化的剧变。,"The Black Death of the mid-fourteenth century was the most devastating natural disaster in European history, ravaging the population and causing economic, social, political, and cultural upheaval."
4195,同时代的编年史家感叹亲生父母忍痛抛弃骨肉。,Contemporary chroniclers lamented how parents abandoned their children.
4196,随着冷战冲突保护伞的解除，对地区冲突（其起源最早追溯于欧洲帝国时代）的重要外部限制随之消失。,"As the overlay of Cold War conflict has been removed, a significant external restraint on regional conflicts (whose origins may often predate even the age of European empires) has disappeared."
4196,在一些情况下，比如东南亚地区，其后果是变得相对缓和，但是在许多地区，冲突和紧张关系则逐步扩散。,"In some cases, such as South East Asia, the consequences to date have been relatively benign, but in many regions rivalries and tensions have escalated."
4196,国际安全的“区域化”是后冷战时代世界军事和安全秩序的一个非常重要和突出的特征。,This 'regionalization' of international security represents an important distinguishing feature of the post-Cold War world military and security order.
4197,起始于20世纪60年代，到80年代持续深入的被称为后现代的风格出现了，后现代主义开始背离未来主义和现代主义的先锋特点。,"Beginning in the 1960s and continuing well into the 1980s, styles emerged that some have referred to as Postmodern.Postmodernism tends to move away from the futurism or cutting-edge qualities of Modernism."
4197,相反，他们赞同传统，无论是运用早期的绘画风格还是将传统的作品提升到更高的优秀艺术水平。,"Instead it favors tradition, whether that means using earlier styles of painting or elevating traditional crafts to the level of fine art."
4197,织工，陶器工、玻璃制造者、金匠和家具制造者都被尊为艺术家。,"Weavers, potters, glassmakers, metalsmiths, and furniture makers have gained respect as artists."
4197,后现代主义艺术家和建筑家常常模糊艺术的界限，创造出吸取了电影、表演、流行文化、雕刻以及建筑等的艺术成分的作品。,"Postmodern artists and architects frequently blur the distinction between the arts, creating works that include elements of film, performance, popular culture, sculpture, and architecture."
4198,怀疑论者之所以认为全球化是一个神话，依靠的是一个完全经济主义的全球化概念，把全球化首先等同于完全整合的全球市场。,"In arguing that globalization is a myth, the sceptics rely on a wholly economistic conception of globalization, equating it primarily with a perfectly integrated global market."
4198,由于认为现有的经济整合水平不符合“理想模型”，而且并没有超过19世纪晚期（古典金本位时期）的水平，所以怀疑论者可以轻松地得出这样的结论：当代“全球化”的程度被完全夸大了（Hirst， 1997）。,"By contending that levels of economic integration fall short of this 'ideal type' and that such integration as there is remains much less significant than in the late nineteenth century (the era of the classical Gold Standard), the sceptics are free to conclude that the extent of contemporary 'globalization' is wholly exaggerated (Hirst, 1997)."
4198,在这方面，怀疑论者认为极端全球主义的观点从根本上是错误的，而且在政治上也是幼稚的，因为它低估了国家政府管制国际经济活动的持久权力。,"In this respect, the sceptics consider the hyperglobalist thesis as fundamentally flawed and also politically naive since it underestimates the enduring power of national governments to regulate international economic activity."
4198,国际化力量并没有摆脱控制，相反要依靠国家政府的管制权力来确保经济自由化的不断进行。,"Rather than being out of control, the forces of internationalization themselves depend on the regulatory power of national governments to ensure continuing economic liberalization."
4199,海外游记带来的冲击进一步助长了对于基督教以及欧洲文化的怀疑主义。,Skepticism about both Christianity and European culture was nourished by travel reports.
4199,17世纪的商人、传教士、游方医生以及探险家开始出版大量的游记类书籍，讲述形形色色的土著文化。,"In the course of the seventeenth century, traders, missionaries, medical practitioners, and explorers began to publish an increasing number of travel books that gave accounts of many different cultures."
4199,18世纪的地理探险，尤其是英国探险家詹姆斯•库克在太平洋上对于塔希提岛、新西兰和澳大利亚的发现，激起了更多的热情。,"Then, too, the new geographical adventures of the eighteenth century, especially the discovery in the Pacific of Tahiti, New Zealand, and Australia by the British explorer James Cook, aroused much enthusiasm."
4199,受过教育的欧洲人以不同的方式回应着关于这些遥远的地区的报告。,Educated Europeans responded to these accounts of far-off lands in different ways.
4200,很明显，环境退化不是什么新鲜事物，我们有足够的证据来说明前现代的环境问题。,Clearly environmental degradation is nothing new.We have ample evidence and accounts of premodern environmental problems.
4200,一方面，有许多因气候和天气的自然循环的变化而导致环境变迁的例子，如中世纪欧洲的小冰河时期，这种环境的变迁促使大陆人口发生逆转（Lamb， 1977; Bryson 和 Murray， 1977; Utterstrom，1988; Wigley 等，1981）。,"On the one hand, there are examples of environmental change caused by shifts in the natural cycles of climate and weather, like the medieval European little ice age, which contributed to continental demographic reversal (Lamb, 1977; Bryson and Murray, 1977; Utterstrom, 1988; Wigley et al., 1981)."
4200,另一方面，也有许多主要由人类活动引发的环境变迁的例子：早期游牧部落捕猎长毛象导致其灭绝，中世纪伦敦的煤烟，发生在中国的滥伐森林和土壤侵蚀以及14世纪西欧的人口过剩、资源短缺和土壤肥率下降等（Wilkinson，1973; TeBrake，1974）。,"On the other hand, there are examples of environmental change caused predominantly by human activity: mammoths hunted to extinction by early human nomads, coal smoke in medieval London, deforestation and soil erosion in China, overpopulation, resource shortage and collapses of soil fertility in fourteenth-century Western Europe (Wilkinson, 1973; TeBrake, 1974)."
4201,在接下来的8.3节中，我们对环境全球化的历史形态进行了比较。,"This is followed, in section 8.3, by a comparison of historical forms of environmental globalization."
4201,在8.4节中，我们对6个作为个案研究的国家在全球性和区域性的环境退化模式中的作用以及这些国家因此而面临的环境威胁等进行了更加详细的分析。,"In section 8,4, we offer a more detailed analysis of the particular contribution of each of our six case study countries to global and regional patterns of environmental degradation and the threats that they consequently face."
4201,最后，在8.5节中，我们转而考察这些过程对发达资本主义国家主权与自主所带来的影响。,"Finally, in section 8.5, we move on to consider what the impact of these processes is on the sovereignty and autonomy of SIACS."
4202,然而，从20世纪中期起，这种情景就发生了变化（参看网格表8-2）。,"However, from the mid-twentieth century the picture changes (see grid 8.2)."
4202,西方资本主义经济只是导致环境退化的动力之一，南方的工业化和国家社会主义工业化也参与到环境退化的动力中。,"Capitalist economies in the West have been joined as agents of environmental degradation, by both southern industrialization and state socialist industrialization."
4202,南方的工业化大大增加了潜在环境问题的总量并扩大了环境问题涉及的地理范围。,The former massively increased the total volume of potential environmental problems as well as their geographical spread.
4203,当这些因素加上许多现代技术中固有的巨大变革力量和生态危险等因素时，如新化学制品产业、依赖矿物燃料的公共交通系统以及核技术等，环境退化就肯定会呈现出全球化形式（参看图8-3中关于当代含氯氟烃的生产情况）。,"When these forces were combined with the immense transformative powers and ecological risks inherent in many modern technologies - new chemicals industries, mass transport systems dependent on fossil fuel, nuclear technologies - environmental degradation acquired a decisively global form (see figure 8.3 regarding CFC production in this era)."
4203,当代跨国污染、全球环境公共品问题以及资源短缺等所达到的水平是历史上绝无仅有的。,"No historic parallel exists for the contemporary levels of transboundary pollution, environmental commons problems and resource squeezes."
4203,因此，对于今天的环境运动、环境条约和国际环境机构来说，其数量和作用前所未有也毫不令人吃惊。,"Nor, unsurprisingly, is there any significant historical comparator for todays environmental movements, treaties and international agencies."
4204,凡是在这些组织想方设法获得进入机会的地方，它们的力量总是非正式的而不是正式的，而且它们通常依靠国家的选民和公众给政府施加压力。,"Where these groups have managed to gain some access, their power has been informal rather than formal, and they have usually depended on national electorates and publics to put pressure on individual governments."
4204,然而，它们现在已经使自己作为正规的游戏者加入到国家环境行动的许多领域中；1992年它们出席了里约会议就具有历史意义（Wapper， 1996）。,"However, they have now established themselves as regular players in many fields of international environmental action; their presence if not their power at the Rio conference in 1992 (see below) was historic (Wapner, 1996)."
4204,欧洲环境组织对“Brent Spa”事件（在这次事件中，壳牌公司得到英国政府的同意，试图将一台旧石油钻探平台埋入海中）作出了协调一致的反应，这表明了它们具有重要的组织能力。,"The coordinated response of European environmental organizations to the Brent Spar incident (in which Shell, with the agreement of the UK government, sought to sink an old oil rig at sea) indicates their significant organizational capacity."
4205,而且，这些人口将不可避免地生活在工业化社会。,"Moreover, this will be a population which lives overwhelmingly in industrialized societies."
4205,10亿多中国人和生活在太平洋周围的5亿左右的人口在短时期进行的工业革命造成了资源祜竭问题，其紧迫性连最早的消耗主义者也从来没有遇见过。,"The passage of over a billion Chinese, as well as about another half a billion people on the Pacific rim, through a condensed industrial revolution poses the question of resource exhaustion with an urgency that never occurred to the original depletionists."
4205,更多的全球人口和更高的工业化水平总是意味着更多的污染和更多的资源消耗。,"All things being equal, a larger global population at a higher level of industrialization will mean more pollution and more resource consumption."
4206,最后，对那些可能失去劳动力的工厂，联邦政府也给予了一定补偿：继续敞开大门让移民进來。,"Finally, as a compensation to industry that might lose laborers in this fashion the federal government continued to hold open the doors to immigration (Immigration Acts of 1864)."
4206,正如比尔德所说:“北部联邦同盟盟员和辉格党代理人曾试图要实现的一切，在这短短4年中全都实现了，而且还不仅仅限于这些。,"As Beard puts it, ""All that two generations of Federalists and Whigs had tried to get was won within four short years, and more besides.""."
4206,”说“短短4年”，也有些夸张。其中一些措施也是重建运动的一部分；另外，硬币支付措施到1879年才恢复。,"""Four short years"" is a rhetorical exaggeration; some of these measures were also part of Reconstruction (1865 — 1876), and the resumption of specie payment did not take place until 1879."
4207,与以前的迁移相比较，当代迁移还存在劳动力中有熟练技术和受过良好教育的那部分人的流失，从而使国内经济枯竭。,"Contemporary migration, in comparison with previous epochs, also tends to cream off some of the most skilled and educated parts of the workforce, impoverishing the domestic economy."
4207,联合国贸发组织的报告说，印度、中国、韩国和菲律宾在1972〜1985年间就有14.5万受过科学训练的工人流失到美国。,"The UNDP reports that India, China, South Korea and the Philippines alone lost 145,000 scientifically trained workers to the USA between 1972 and 1985."
4207,但是，正如19世纪一样，当代迁移带来的经济利益是向国内汇款。,"But, as in the nineteenth century, the main economic benefit of contemporary migration is the reverse flow of remittances from workers to their home country."
4208,1979年建立的欧洲货币体制（EMS）在70年代通过“蛇形浮动”在其中确定利率的尝试失败后，为欧共体国家提供了一个固定汇率体制。,The European Monetary System (EMS) was founded in 1979 to provide a fixed exchange rate system for European Community countries following abortive attempts to fix rates between them in the 1970s through the ‘snake’.
4208,汇率机制为参与国家提供了正式的工具，把每种货币的浮动限制在协商的±2.25%之内，并且为成员国提供了干预的程序，防止任何货币脱离限制。,"The Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) provided the formal apparatus for the participating countries, limiting fluctuations of each currency to 2.25 per cent either side of an agreed value, and providing procedures for member countries to intervene to support any currency moving towards the edge of its band."
4208,1993年欧洲货币体制危机之后，浮动范围扩大到±15%。,Following the EMS crisis in 1993 these bands were widened to 15 per cent.
4209,“火力差距”之巨大可以通过世界上一些力量相当悬殊的军事对抗在这一时期的发生情况来说明。,"The dramatic scale of this 'firepower gap' is illustrated by the occurrence, during this period, of some of the most lopsided military confrontations in world history."
4209,在1841年与中国发生的鸦片战争中，英国的“复仇”号轮船在一天内独自摧毁了“9条中国舢船，5座堡垒，两个军事驻地和一个海岸炮兵连”（Parker，1988，第154页）。,"During the 1841 Opium War with China the British steamship Nemesis single-handedly destroyed in one day '9 war junks, 5 forts, 2 military stations and 1 shore battery' (Parker, 1988, p. 154)."
4209,由于一些战船和优良军事火力配备的使用，一年内清朝帝国就被击败。,Within a year the Chinese empire was defeated by the deployment of a few gunboats and superior military firepower.
4210,以藤牌、毛竹、铁叉作为标准武器，表现了戚继光的部队仍然没有脱离农民气息。但如果认为他不了解火器的功效，那是不符合实际的。,It would be inexplicable if Ch'i Chi-kuang had been unaware of the significance of firearms.
4210,他在实战中运用过火器，和将领讲解火器的利弊，并在奏折中提到了火器的重要性。,"He used them satisfactorily in engagements, lectured on their importance before his officers and men, and brought them to the attention of the emperor."
4210,然则终戚继光的一生，他仍然以上述的鸳鸯阵法作为主要的战术。,"Yet he never abandoned the formation and fighting methods of his infantry squad, which, compared with contemporary uses of weapons, seemed to be lagging a hundred years behind."
4210,这倒不是由于他因循守旧，而是牵涉到很多不易解决的复杂因素。,"This incongruity was a very complicated matter, however."
4211,因为资本控制废止了，就像欧洲单一市场一样，所以，国内防投机措施非常有限，这是1992年和1993年的货币危机的部分原因。,"Capital controls provided some defence against speculative attacks and some policy autonomy within a fixed exchange rate system.Since capital controls were dismantled, as in Europe as part of the Single European Market, national defences against speculative attack are very limited, hence in part the 1992 and 1993 currency crises."
4211,只有固定汇率体制中的被钉牢的国家购买被投机攻击的货币时，方能有效地保持货币平价。然而，它们只能这样做，因为它不会干预它们自己的国内货币政策。,"It is only when the anchor country in a fixed exchange rate system buys up the currencies under attack that currency parities effectively can be maintained; they will only do so, however, to the extent that it does not interfere with their own domestic monetary policy."
4211,1992年9月，德国当局很不情愿地扩大德国货币供应，以保护者如英镑等被认为高估的货币。,In September 1992 the German authorities were unwilling to expand the German money supply in order to defend currencies such as sterling which they regarded as being overvalued.
4212,定期贸易需要制度化结构来保障交易中的产权。,Regular trade needs institutional structures to secure property rights in exchange.
4212,货物集散港口是传统上组织贸易的商人团体的基地。,Entrepot ports were home to merchant communities which traditionally organized trade.
4212,商人们对当前和未来的货场状况作详细的判断，以在各地区间调剂货物的价格。,"Merchants made sophisticated judgements about current and future market conditions, leading to some convergence in the prices of commodities between areas."
4213,因此，这就是宗教的所谓地理意义的广度，虽然有些宗教通常只是集中在某些区域，但是它们的社会影响确实将世界宗教与许多以前存在过和观在的宗教信仰区分开來。,"Thus it is their geographical extensity, albeit often a regionally focused one, and their social impact that truly mark out the world religions from the many faiths that did and do exist."
4213,它们是由宗教信仰和宗教仪式组成的系统，已经具备了在关键的历史时刻使自己从起源地扩散出去的能力，而且可以包容、改变并征服其他文化和宗教。,"They are systems of belief and ritual that have had the capacity at crucial historical moments to reach out from their place of origin and embrace, convert and conquer other cultures and other religions."
4213,最明显的例子是伊斯兰教和基督教，其宗教的动员能力与扩大军事力量和文化影响的能力是结合在一起的。,"Most clearly in the cases of Islam and Christianity, the mobilizing capacity of religion was coupled with the capacity to extend military power and cultural influence."
4214,继续观察日本工农业发展的利益冲突是很有必要的。,It remains necessary to see these conflicts between Japanese industrial and agrarian interests in their proper perspective.
4214,使商业从地主中分裂出来的力量远没有使它们联合起来的力量强大。,The forces that divided business from the landlord were less important than those that united them.
4214,正如我们在下一节里将要看到的，当赌注投入时，反资本主义的激进主义就不得不成为牺牲品了。,"As we shall see in the next section, when the chips were down, anticapitalist radicalism had to be sacrificed."
4214,就本质而言，明治对代地主问题的解决和工业化的计划使农业和商业集团走到了一起。,Fundamentally both the Meiji land settlement and the program of industrialization brought agrarian and commercial interests together.
4215,虽然国家内部特定的团体会因为全球竞争而受到损害，但是几乎所有的国家在生产特定商品上都有比较优势，可以长期利用。,"While particular groups within a country may be made worse off as a result of global competition, nearly all countries have a comparative advantage in producing certain goods which can be exploited in the long run."
4215,新马克思主义者和激进主义者认为这样“乐观观点”没有根据，他们相信全球资本主义在国家内部和国家之间制造并且强化了不平等的结构模式。,"Neo-Marxists and radicals regard such an ‘optimistic view' as unjustified, believing that global capitalism creates and reinforces structural patterns of inequality within and between countries."
4215,但是他们至少在这一点上同意新自由主义的看法：社会保护的传统福利形式不断陷入困境并且难以维持。,
4215,,But they agree at least with their neoliberal counterparts that traditional welfare options for social protection are looking increasingly threadbare and difficult to sustain.
4216,实际上在欧洲，正建立一个新的集体安全结构，一个修改了的“四国联盟”。它将军事和安全事务更加紧密地整合在一起。,"Europe, in effect, is witnessing the development of a new structure of collective security - a revised 'Concert of Europe' (see below) - which invites a tighter integration of military and security affairs."
4216,在今天的大西洋地区，集体防御而不是单一国家的防御是事实。,Collective defence rather than solely national defence is today a reality within the Atlantic arena.
4217,不太成功的加泰罗尼亚民族主义也是如此。,The same could be said for the less successful Catalonian nationalism.
4217,德国民族认同和文化就是在18世纪和19世纪许多零散的小国家和公爵领地范围内建立起来的。,German national identity and culture was created right across the borders of the many fragmented German statelets and duchies of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.
4217,即使随着联合的德意上民族国家在19世纪晚期的形成，新国家还远没有成为德国人民或德国文化惟一的宝库。,"Even with the formation of a united German nation-state in the late nineteenth century it was far from clear that the new state was the sole repository of the German people, or German culture."
4218,欧洲的扩张还给征服者带来了其他经济后果。,European expansion also had other economic effects on the conquerors.
4218,无论他们在新大陆前进到何处，欧洲人总是极力寻找金矿和银矿。,"Wherever they went in the New World, Europeans sought to find sources of gold and silver."
4218,一位阿兹特克人这样评论道，西班牙征服者“渴望和贪求黄金。他们的肉体因为贪婪而膨胀，他们欲壑难平，他们像贪婪的猪一样四处寻找黄金”。,"One Aztec commented that the Spanish conquerors ""longed and lusted for gold. Their bodies swelled with greed, and their hunger was ravenous; they hungered like pigs for that gold."""
4218,墨西哥和秘鲁南部（今日之玻利维亚）富足的银矿被发现和开采。,Rich silver deposits were found and exploited in Mexico and southern Peru (modern Bolivia).
4218,1545年，秘鲁的坡托西矿被开采后，进入欧洲的贵重金属的价值翻了四倍。,"When the mines at  Potosi in Peru were opened in 1545, the value of precious metals imported into Europe quadrupled."
4218,1503到1650年间，估计有将近1.8万吨的白银和200多吨的黄金被运抵西维尔港，引发了对西班牙经济影响深远的价格革命。,"Between 1503 and 1650, nearly 18,000 tons of silver and more than 200 tons of gold entered the port of Seville, setting off a price revolution in the Spanish economy."
4219,生产过程使广泛而密切的贸易关系成为必要（见第5章）。,Production processes now entail intensive and extensive trading relations (see chapter 5).
4219,现在公司内贸易占贸易总量的1/4～1/3 （UNCTAD 1995）。,"Intrafirm trade now accounts for between a quarter and a third of total trade (UNCTAD, 1995)."
4219,切割价值链也扩大了业化国家和发展中国家的贸易，促进了向新的国际劳动分工的转变（Castells，1996；Hoogvelt，1997，第 3 章）。,"Slicing up the value chain has increased trade too between industrialized and developing countries, reinforcing the shift towards a new international division of labour (Castells, 1996; Hoogvelt, 1997, ch. 3)."
4219,尽管过去发达工业过程都集中在发达经济体中，现在公司却将产品过程的诸阶阶设置在低工资国家或者与亚洲或拉丁美洲的地方公司签订转包合问，由此导致了发达国家与发屐中国家高水平的贸易往来。,"Whereas, in the past, advanced industrial processes tended to be concentrated in developed economies, companies now locate segments of the production process in lower wage countries or subcontract to local companies in Asia or Latin America, which leads to higher levels of trade between developed and developing countries."
4220,僭主通常通过政变获取权力，然后靠雇佣兵维持统洽。,Tyrants usually achieved power by a local coup d'état and maintained it by using mercenary soldiers.
4220,一旦掌权，他们就建立新的集市、神庙和城墙，这不仅为城市增光添彩，而且还能提高他们的声望。,"Once in power, they built marketplaces, temples, and walls that created jobs, glorified the city, and enhanced their own popularity."
4220,僭主还耽于商贸利益。,Tyrants also favored the interests of merchants and traders.
4220,尽管取得了这些成就，到公元前6世纪，僭主还是失去了支持。在希腊这样一个共同体里，当一个超越于法律之外的体制似乎与希腊共同体的法律理想相对立时，失去支持便是很自然的事情。,"Despite these achievements, however, tyranny fell out of favor by the end of the sixth century B.C. Its very nature as a system outside the law seemed contradictory to the ideal of law in a Greek community."
4221,大名不得不在家乡和江户同时维持两套宅府，他们的消费自然而然地增加了。,The expenses of the daimyo increased as they had to maintain a residence both at home and in Edo.
4221,由于他们在首都没有机构，以及他们本人的旅途费用也很昂贵，并拥有庞大的随从人员，使得他们不得不用硬币来支付费用。但是他们又没有权力铸造硬币。,"For their establishment in the capital and the costs of travel for themselves and a large retinue they had to pay in specie, which they had no right to coin."
4221,为支付这些费用，自然提出了在采邑间进行贸易的要求。,These expenses put a heavy demand on the finances of many fiefs.
4221,所以大名通常必须把多余的稻米和其他土产运到市场上去，依靠商人出售。,"To pay for them, daimyo generally had to ship their excess rice and other local products to the market, using the services of the merchant."
4221,封建贵族开始依赖于商人以取得信贷，同样的，商人也依靠大名以求政治上的保护。,"Often the feudal aristocrat became dependent on the merchant for credit, while the merchant, on the other hand, depended on the daimyo for political protection."
4222,语言、学校教育、交通和通信系统、礼仪习惯和认同等都逐渐在有一定领土范围的民族国家中确定。,"Language, schooling, transport and communication systems, liturgical practice and identity all came to be defined increasingly in terms of the territorially bounded nation."
4222,外部的或外来的文化冲击受到压制或者受到怀疑和敌视。,External or alien cultural influences were suppressed or treated with suspicion and hostility.
4222,在西方，世界主义和国际主义仍有很多拥护者。,Cosmopolitanism and internationalism maintained an audience in the West.
4222,跨民族的文化实践和制度继续存在。,Transnational cultural practices and institutions continued to exist.
4222,的确，强有力的世俗意识形态和话语——自由主义、马克思主义和现代科学——发源于欧洲民族国家体系的内部，其具有的启蒙理性主义无论正确与否，都表明了其普遍诉求和适用性。,
4222,问题：翻译有误语言、学校教育、交通和通信系统、礼仪习惯和认同等都在有一定领土范围的民族国家中逐渐变得明确。,
4222,外部的或外来的文化冲击受到压制或者受到怀疑和敌视。在西方，世界主义和国际主义仍有很多拥护者。跨民族的文化实践和制度继续存在。的确，强有力的世俗意识形态和话语——自由主义、马克思主义和现代科学——发源于欧洲民族国家体系的内部，其具有的启蒙理性主义无论正确确与否，都表明了其普遍诉求和适用性。,"Indeed, from within the heart of the European nation-state system, there emerged powerful secular ideologies and discourses - liberalism, Marxism and modern science whose Enlightenment rationalism, rightly or wrongly, suggested their universal appeal and applicability."
4223,例如 ，中世纪世界体系的交往能力受到了沟通手段有限的制约，远远低于当代的交往能力。因为在当代卫星和互联网有利于即时的而且几乎是同步的全球沟通（Deibert， 1997）。,"For instance, the interaction capacity of the medieval world system, constrained as it was by limited means of communication,among other things, was considerably less than that of the contemporary era, in which satellites and the Internet facilitate instant and almost real-time global communication (Deibert, 1997)."
4223,因此，基础设施的变化对于全球交往能力的发展和演变具有重要影响。,Thus changes in infrastructure have important consequences for the development and evolution of global interaction capacity.
4224,宗教改革带来了宗教价值的重估和许多的政治动荡。,The Reformation had brought a revival of religious values accompanied by much political turmoil.
4224,尤其在意大利，文艺复兴的世俗的热情让位于焦虑、不定、苦难和对精神体验的呼唤。,"Especially in Italy, the worldly enthusiasm of the Renaissance gave way to anxiety, uncertainty, suffering, and a yearning for spiritual experience."
4224,矫饰主义正反映了这种环境，它主张故意打破繁盛文艺复兴时期确立的平衡、和谐和适度的原则。,"Mannerism reflected this environment in its deliberate attempt to break down the High Renaissance principles of balance, harmony, and moderation."
4225,在所有正式帝国中，大英帝国在最高峰时是最具全球性。,At its height the British Empire was the most global of any formal empire.
4225,尽管殖民政策变化不断而且常常具有很大的偶然性，但是很明显，在许多领土和殖民地范围内，大英帝国在实行统治以及维系中央周边地区以及都市和各省之间的复杂联系时，却有强大的文化或意识形态维度。,"Although colonial policy was variable and often rather haphazard, it is clear that in many of the dominions and colonies there was a strong cultural or ideological dimension to both the execution of British dominance and the maintenance of complex links between centre and periphery, metropolis and province."
4225,这种文化或意识形态维度有许多种形式，但最重要的两种形式就是帝国教育政策的执行以及帝国通信基础设施的建立，这两种形式提供了文化和交往全球化的最明显的例证。,"This took a multiplicity of forms, but two of the most important were the conduct of imperial educational policy and the establishment of an imperial communications infrastructure, both of which offer clear examples of the globalization of culture and communications."
4226,发达经济体的解工业化，即制造业占总就业和总产出份额的下降（尽管是按照现行价值衡量）经常被归因于贸易竞争，在美国和英国尤其如此。,"Deindustrialization in advanced economies, that is, the decline of manufacturing industry as a share of total employment and output (at least when measured in current prices), has often been attributed to trade competition, particularly in the US and Britain."
4226,某些相对衰落是贸易模式转变和国际劳动分工不可避免的产物。,Some relative decline is an inevitable product of shifting trade patterns and the associated new international division of labour.
4226,制造业就业份额一直大幅度下降；随着制造业生产力水平的提高，生产一定数量商品所需的工人越来越少。,"Manufacturing’s share of employment tends to decline at higher levels of development: as productivity rises in manufacturing, progressively fewer and fewer workers are needed to produce a given level of output."
4227,在19世纪后半期，主要货币的价值由金价决定，固定汇率制就建立在这个基础之上，这就是古典金本位制。,"In the latter part of the nineteenth century the values of major currencies were fixed to the price of gold, providing the basis for a system of fixed exchange rates: the classical Gold Standard."
4227,在巴黎国际金融会议（1867年）之后，1878年正式建立了金本位制。,After the preliminary Paris International Monetary Conference (1867) the Gold Standard was established formally in 1878.
4227,早期参与者主要限于主要的欧洲国家、北美国家和澳大利亚。到了20世纪初，成员国范围扩大到许多欧洲国家、拉丁美洲国家、日本和主要的殖民地区，后来，有些落后国家退出并将其货币贬值了。,"Initially, participation was confined to the leading European economies, North America and Australia; it was only in the early twentieth century that membership expanded to include the bulk of the European and Latin American countries, Japan and the leading colonial territories, although some of the weaker economies later left and devalued their currencies."
4228,周人曾长期居住在文明边缘区的渭水流域，所以他们在借用西、北方牧羊“蛮族”的军事技术的同时，也共享商的语言和主要文化。,"The Chou people had for long lived in the Wei valley on the fringes of civilization, so they shared the language and basic culture of the Shang but at the same time borrowed military techniques from the sheepherding ""barbarians"" to the north and west."
4228,因而，当周人侵占中国北部时，虽然推翻了商朝统治，但中国文明的发展并没有中断。,"Consequently when the Chou overran north China, they did overthrow the Shang dynasty but did not interrupt the evolution of Chinese civilization."
4228,文字系统同祖先崇拜、占卜术一起，依旧保存完好，社会依然分为贵族武士和农民群众两大阶级。,"The writing system continued as before, as did anceslor worship, the methods of divination, and the division of society into aristocratic warriors and peasant masses."
4229,如今，在伊斯兰教世界，随着蛮族的一系列侵略，包括十字军、柏柏尔人、贝都因人、塞尔柱人和蒙古人，出现了同样的发展情况。,"The same development occurred now in the Islamic world following its series of barbarian invasions - Crusaders, Berbers, Bedouins, Seljuks, and Mongols."
4229,在这里，如同在西方一样，人们面临巨大的灾难，为了得到救济和安慰，只得求助于宗教信仰。,"Here, as in the West, people turned to religion for succor and consolation in the face of material disaster."
4229,但在西方，经院哲学最终受到驳斥并被取代，而在穆斯林世界，它却一直居统治地位至19世纪末。,"But whereas in the West scholasticism eventually was challenged and replaced, in the Moslem world it remained dominant through the nineteenth century."
4230,因此，人类是本我、自我和超我的战场。,"The human being was thus a battleground among id, ego, and superego."
4230,自我和超我对无意识的本我的影响起一种抑制作用，将本我的冲动所想要的东西摒除在意识之外。,Ego and superego exerted restraining influences on the unconscious id and repressed or kept out of consciousness what they wanted to.
4230,抑制在童年即已开始，心理分析是通过心理医生和病人之间的一场对话来完成的。在对话中，心理学家试图深入探究病人的记忆，以便能够将抑制的链条一直追溯到其童年起源。,"Repression began in childhood, and psychoanalysis was accomplished through a dialogue between psychotherapist and patient in which the therapist probed deeply into memory in order to retrace the chain of repression all the way back to its childhood origins."
4230,通过使人们意识到无意识以及无意识中所被抑制的内容，病人的心理障碍就被解决了。,"By making the conscious mind aware of the unconscious and its repressed contents, the patient’s psychic conflict was resolved."
4231,当然，世界宗教在传播过程中也呈现出文化等级和不均衡。,"Of course, world religions also display cultural hierarchy and unevenness in their spread."
4231,牧师和精英的宗教信仰很少与普通大众相同，信徒社区在信仰和实践的规范方面也不是十分民主的。,The religion of clerics and elites has rarely been identical to that of the mass of the population nor has the community of the faithful been particularly democratic in its regulation of belief and practice.
4231,同样，鉴于不同社会信奉这些信仰的信徙之间存在巨大的差异，所有宗教呈现出巨大的地理范围的差异，而且与以前的文化和宗教混合在一起，也就不足为怪了。,"Similarly, given the immense differences between adherents of these faiths across different societies it is little surprise that all show large geographical variations and complex mixtures with pre-existing cultures and religions."
4232,全球化可能涉及全球经济中贏家和输家的不断分化。,Globalization may be linked with a growing polarization between winners and losers in the global economy.
4232,但是结果不一定是这样，因为至少在新自由主义看来，全球经济竞争不一定产生零和结果。,"But this need not be so, for, at least in the neoliberal view, global economic competition does not necessarily produce zero-sum outcomes."
4232,虽然国家内部特定的团体会因为全球竞争而受到损害。但是几乎所有的国家在生产特定商品上都有比较优势，可以长期利用。,"While particular groups within a country may be made worse off as a result of global competition, nearly all countries have a comparative advantage in producing certain goods which can be exploited in the long run."
4233,确切地说，因为竞争优势是相对的，所以，一个国家竞争地位的变化直接影响到其他国家。,"Precisely because competitive advantage is relative, changes in one country's competitive position impact directly on other countries."
4233,这些观点可以80年代美国的情况来作说明。其时，它从一个贸易小国走向了相对开放的贸易大国。,These points are well illustrated by the case of the USA in the 1980s as it moved from trivial trade shares to relative trade openness.
4233,虽然技术赶超意味着美国在一系列工业中失去了相对优势，但它在其他许多部门仍拥有明显的优势。,"Although technological catch-up meant that the US lost relative advantage in a range of industries, it still retained a clear advantage in many others."
4234,美国首席谈判代表哈里•怀特同意上述看法，并成功地抵制了华尔街对资本控制的一致反对 （Helleiner， 1994， 第4章）。,"Harry Dexter White, the USA’s chief negotiator, agreed and successfully resisted Wall Street’s orchestrated opposition to capital controls (Helleiner，1994, ch. 4)."
4234,国际货币基金条约第一条，是布雷顿森林体系的核心，反映了这样一个信念，即“促进和保持高水平的就业和实际收入，把所有成员国生产性资源的开发利用作为经济政策的基本目标。,"The first Article of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the core of the Bretton Woods system, reflected these concerns with a commitment to 'the promotion and maintenance of high levels of employment and real income, and the development of the productive resources of all members as primary objectives of economic policy’."
4234,”与古典金本位不同，战后国际金融秩序——布雷顿森林体系（BWS）——的目的是确保国内的经济目标不从属于全球金融原则，而是优越于全球金融原则。,"Unlike the classical Gold Standard, the postwar international financial order - the Bretton Woods System (BWS) - was designed to ensure that domestic economic objectives were not subordinated to global financial disciplines but, on the contrary, took precedence over them."
4235,温斯坦莱声称：“我们知道，除非全体穷人可以自由使用土地和从中莸得利益：英国不可能是一个自由的共和国。现在我们这些穷人的处境还不如在国王统治下，那时我们虽然身受压迫，毕竟还有些财产， 而现在我们自己的财产已用来购买自由，我们却仍然处在暴政的压迫下。”作为激进主义的一翼，掘地派并不是一个孤立的运动。与之类似的其他运动，引人注目地发生在圈地迅速推进的地区。,"""Wee know,"" said Winstanley, ""that England cannott bee a free Commonwealth unless all the poore commoners have a free use and benefitt of the land; for if this freedome bee not granted, wee that are the poore commoners are in a worse case than we were in the King*s days, for then wee had some estate about us, though wee were under oppression, but now our estates are spent to purchase freedome, and wee are under oppression still of Lords of Mannours’ tyranny.""Though a radical fringe, the Diggers were not an isolated movement; there were other similar ones, notably in areas where enclosures had proceeded rapidly."
4235,但这种运动大多成效甚微，它们对财产的幼稚攻击很快便被镇压下去。,But they made little headway and the premature attack on property was soon crushed.
4236,最为糟糕的也许是这样一种情况：政府在农村的主要代理人是一些花花公子和“门外汉”，他们逋常比那些行政官员和王室机构中的税收人员更加残忍，并不时地得到军队的援助。,"Perhaps worst of all, townsmen and ""outsiders"" — often much more ruthless than the administrators and tax collectors of the monarchy  were its main agents in the countryside, sometimes aided by a revolutionary army."
4236,在革命恐怖的高潮时期，政府允许在征粮的过程中组织更多的革命“军队”。这些军队的主要任务是征收粮食而不赶抵抗入侵之敌。,"At the height of the ""popular terror,"" that is, between the adoption of the maximum general of September 15, 1793, and the execution of Hebert and other sansculotte leaders, March 24, 1794, the government allowed the formation of revolutionary ""armies"" whose purpose was more to collect grain than to fight the enemy."
4237,但是，欧洲人在大洋洲和美洲建立的帝国与罗马、中国或伊斯兰国家不同，它们与当地的文明发生了冲突，欧洲人可以一点一点地从人口上和政治上将它们消灭掉。,"But, unlike Rome, China or Islam, European empires in Oceania and the Americas encountered civilizations that they were able, quite literally, to obliterate, demographically and politically."
4237,这就为永久的大规模迁移提供了可能性，这种大规模的迁移超越了帝国扩张的早期形式。,This created the possibility of permanent mass migrations that exceeded earlier forms of imperial expansion.
4237,尽管军事力量和文化力量在解释这些迁移时仍是重要的因素，但是，与更早期时代相比，这时的经济力量成了更为重要的因素。,"While military and cultural power remain significant factors in explaining these migrations, economic power attained a greater significance than in earlier epochs."
4238,西班牙和葡萄牙是最早进行海外探险的国家。,The early leaders in exploration were the Spanish and Portuguese.
4238,在伊比利亚半岛上这两个君主国家领导了最初两个世纪的欧洲扩张运动的同时，它们也面临着越来越激烈的竞争。,"While the Iberian monarchies led the first two centuries of European expansion, they met increasingly strong competition."
4238,到17世纪，首先是在荷兰，紧接着是在英国和法兰西的强有力的挑战下，葡萄牙和西班牙的领导地位被动摇了（参见地图1-1）。,Their position was eroded in the seventeenth century by the Dutch and subsequently by the British and French: see map 1.
4238,,1.
4239,秘密警察的权力极大地扩展。,The powers of the secret police were expanded.
4239,立宪君主制和社会改革的鼓吹者与各种革命团体受到了迫害。,"Advocates of constitutional monarchy and social reform, along with revolutionary groups, were persecuted."
4239,俄国的各个行政区，但凡是政府认为当地居民有叛国嫌疑的，都被置于军法管制之下。,Entire districts of Russia were placed under martial law if the government suspected the inhabitants of treason.
4239,亚历山大二世改革所建立的郡县议会，其权力被大大缩减了。,"The powers of the zemstvos, created by the reforms of Alexander II, were sharply curtailed."
4240,卡特尔的形成同时伴随着更大的工厂的出现，尤其在钢铁业、机器制造业、重型电力设备业以及化工工业中。,"The formation of cartels was paralleled by a move toward ever-larger factories, especially in the iron and steel, machine, heavy electrical equipment, and chemical industries."
4240,工厂规模的增长产生了一种压力，要求在工业生产中更有效率，而竞争也要求工业生产过程更为经济。,This growth in the size of industrial plants led to pressure for greater efficiency in factory production at the same time that competition led to demands for greater economy.
4240,其结果是要求出现一种尽可能理性化的生产过程，即流水线生产。,The result was a desire to streamline or rationalize production as much as possible.
4241,传统观点认为有三位与开明专制主义关系最为密切的统治者——约瑟夫二世、腓特烈二世和凯瑟琳大帝，其中只有约瑟夫真正地试图依循启蒙理念进行激烈的改革。,"Of the three major rulers most closely associated traditionally with enlightened absolutism--Joseph II, Frederick II, and Catherine the Great--only Joseph sought truly radical changes based on Enlightenment ideas."
4241,腓特烈和凯瑟琳都自视为启蒙主义的信徒，表现出对于开明改革的兴趣，甚至有所尝试。,"Both Frederick and Catherine liked to be cast as disciples of the Enlightenment, expressed interest in enlightened reforms, and even attempted some."
4241,但这两位统治者的政策看来都未受到启蒙思想的过多影响。,But the policies of neither seemed seriously affected by Enlightenment thought.
4242,科学革命期间，人们在解决建立合适的方法以检验和理解物理领域这一难题上倾注很大精力。,"In the course of the Scientific Revolution, attention was paid to the problem of establishing the proper means to examine and understand the physical realm."
4242,科学方法的发明对于现代世界中的科学进步来说是非常关键的。,This creation of a scientific method was crucial to the evolution of science in the modern world.
4242,说也奇怪，最先尝试着找到一种科学方法的却是一个几乎没有任何科学资历的英国人，他的新方法在17世纪对英国科学家们造成很大影响，并在18世纪影响了欧洲其他国家的科学家。,"Curiously enough, it was an Englishman with few scientific credentials who attempted to put forth a new method of acquiring knowledge that made an impact on English scientists in the seventeenth century and other European scientists in the eighteenth century."
4243,在某种意义上说，科学革命并非一场革命。,"In one sense, the Scientific Revolution was not a revolution."
4243,我们通常提到“革命”这个词时，都会将其与爆炸性的变化以及迅速推翻传统权威联系起来，但在科学革命中看不到这些。,It was not characterized by the explosive change and rapid overthrow of traditional authority that we normally associate with the word revolution.
4243,科学革命的确推翻了数个世纪以来的权威，但却是以一种渐进的、零散的方式完成的。,"The Scientific Revolution did overturn centuries of authority, but only in a gradual and piecemeal fashion."
4243,然而，毫无疑问，其结果是革命性的。,"Nevertheless, its results were truly revolutionary."
4243,科学革命是近代西方文明步入世俗的、物质性的发展道路上的关键 一步。,The Scientific Revolution was a key factor in setting Western civilization on its modern secular and material path.
4244,空想社会主义者反对私有产权和早期工业资本主义的竞争精神。,The utopian socialists were against private property and the competitive spirit of early industrial capitalism.
4244,他们认为，通过取缔这些东西，创建一些新的社会组织体系，人类将能够获得一种更好的环境。,"By eliminating these things and creating new systems of social organization, they thought, a better environment for humanity could be achieved."
4244,罗伯特•欧文 （1771—1858）是空想社会主义者代表之一。他是一位英国棉纺织品制造商，相信人们生活在合作的环境中才会显示出其真正的善良本性。,"One prominent utopian socialist was Robert Owen (1771--1858), a British cotton manufacturer who believed that humans would reveal their true natural goodness if they lived in a cooperative environment."
4244,苏格兰的新拉纳克以前是一个由工厂发展起来的肮脏的小镇，欧文成功地将其转变为一个繁荣、健康的社区。,"At New Lanark in Scotland, he was successful in transforming a squalid factory town into a flourishing, healthy community."
4245,大多数的国际贸易仍然集中在初级产品部门。,Most international business remained concentrated in the primary products sector.
4245,主要的石油公司继续控制这些部门，而其他的跨国公司开始控制采矿和一系列的金属加工业。,"The leading oil firms continued to dominate this sector, while other MNCs came to control the mining and processing of a range of metals."
4245,主营水果的美国公司、经营茶叶和糖的英国公司投资于种植业，并逐渐控制这些产品的贸易往来。,"US companies, in fruit, and British companies, in tea and sugar, invested in plantations and came to dominate trade in these commodities."
4246,按照传统，欧洲债券持有者被喻为避免自己财产被征税的比利时牙医。,According to legend the typical holder of a Eurobond is a Belgian dentist anxious to prevent his savings from being taxed.
4246,实际上，这些资产主要由机构投资人持有，特别是养老基金。,"In fact, assets are mainly held by institutional investors, notably pension funds."
4246,跨国公司在现金剩余时代常常既是债券的主要发行人，又是主要的购买者。,"As well as being major issuers of bonds, multinational corporations are often significant purchasers during periods of cash surplus."
4247,这6个国家卷入全球金融体制中的模式也许在银行部门体现得最为突出。,
4247,,Patterns of national enmeshment in the global financial system among these six countries are perhaps nowhere as distinctive as in respect of the banking sector.
4247,1970年以来，随着全球金融活动的发展，国际银行业也得到了扩展。,"Since 1970, international banking has expanded in parallel with the growth of global financial activity."
4247,第二次世界大战前夕，英国跨国银行有2000多家分支机构，而且到70-80年代它们竞争力丧失以前一直是最优秀的（Jones，1993，第10章）。,"British multinational banks had over 2,000 branches on the eve of the Second World War and were pre-eminent until their competitiveness waned in the 1970s and 1980s (Jones, 1993, ch. 10)."
4248,因此，贸易全球化依赖跨国公司的创新能力，侬赖跨国公司借助于通信技术和管理技术进步而有效地组织跨国生产和销售的能力。,The globalization of business thus depends on the innovatory capacity of firms and their ability to organize efficiently cross-border production and distribution networks with the aid of advances in both communications technology and management techniques.
4248,如果像过去那样，从事跨国生产仅是为了规避贸易壁垒，人们可能会预期其扩展将要放慢。或者相反，因为贸易限制已大大减少，交通运输的成本已大大降低。,"If, as in the past, multinational production were undertaken simply to circumvent trade barriers, it might be expected that its expansion would have slowed, or even reversed, because trade restrictions and transport costs have fallen dramatically."
4249,在拉丁美洲、非洲和亚洲，西方国家帮助训练并武装本土的军事力量，其目的或者是为了补充帝国的军事力量，或是为了在争夺全球霸权的竞争中加强其非正式的军事联盟。,"Throughout Latin America, Africa, and Asia, Western states trained and equipped indigenous military forces, either to supplement imperial forces or to cement informal military alliances in the struggle for global power."
4249,甚至在日本和中国，军事和政治精英们积极寻求获得西方的军事支持和援助（Beasley，1995，第64页；Black，1998）。,"Even Japanese and Chinese military and political elites actively sought and acquired Western military assistance (Beasley, 1995, p. 64; Black, 1998)."
4249,在20世纪初，全球军事争夺的密度和欧洲军事权力网扩展的范围已经将全球压缩成一个单一的地缘政治的空间。,By the turn of the twentieth century the intensity of global military competition and the extensive reach of European networks of military power had compressed the globe into a single geopolitical space.
4250,种植黄麻本来是供给当地使用的，到了19世纪50年代，它已开始成为商品作物。,Jute had been grown for local use and became a commercial crop during the second quarter of the nineteenth century.
4250,茶叶（主要在阿萨姆帮），胡椒和蓝靛的买卖也完全商品化了。,"Tea (mainly in Assam), pepper, and indigo complete the list."
4250,这些作物的种植形式多种多样，从种植园经济直至个体小农经营的农业生产组织。,Arrangements for growing them ranged from something close to a straightforward plantation to agrarian forms of a putting-out system by which advances were made to small individual cultivators.
4251,例如，有些人认为，有助于全球变暖的二氧化碳的增加将被海洋吸收气体的能力所抵消。,"For example, it is argued that contemporary increases in carbon dioxide levels, which contribute towards global warming, will be counteracted by the capacity of the oceans to absorb the gas."
4251,还有人认为，当代森林砍伐的程度，尤其是南美和东南亚热带雨林被破坏的程度将大大降低全球环境吸收二氧化碳的能力，因此将加速全球变暖。,"Others argue that contemporary levels of deforestation, particularly in the tropical rainforests of South America and South East Asia, will radically diminish the capacity of the global environment to absorb carbon dioxide, thus accelerating global warming."
4251,最为复杂的是，全球气温的增加可能融化两极的冰层，从而导致海平面的大幅度上升。,"Most complex of all, the increase in global temperatures could melt the polar ice caps and lead to large-scale rises in sea levels."
4252,事实上，中国的农村绅士和有钱的地主最明显的区别之一在于，绅士们绝不染指体力劳动，而是致力于做学问和搞艺术。,Indeed one of the main distinctions between a landed gentleman in China and a mere rich landlord seems to have been that the gentleman avoided any taint of manual labor and devoted himself to scholarship and the arts.
4252,乡绅可以为了改善水利灌溉条件同政府讨价还价，对于农民来说其后果是一目了然的。,The gentry did bargain with the government in order to improve irrigation.
4252,我们也可以断定绅士会竭力使农民永志不忘他们所办的好事。但就这类事情的性质来看，这不可能是经常重复和连继不断的工作。,"Though the results were certainly visible to the peasants, and we may be sure that the gentry did their best to impress on the peasants what they had done for them, by its very nature this could not be a continuous or frequently repeated activity."
4252,一个地方的灌溉渠道也只能有这么多数量。,In any one area it is possible to get only so many irrigation ditches.
4252,更何况，当中央政府管理的以及大量地方政府管理的灌溉系统渐渐毁弃，维持旧体系的营运就会显得愈益困难，营建新的体系则更不可能。,Furthermore as the resources available to the central government and even a good many local ones declined) it became harder to keep old projects in working order and impossible to get new ones.
4253,贸易使所有产出部门的状况发生了革命性变化，如今几乎没有一种产业仅仅依赖于国内市场或者国内生产部门和原材料。,Trade has revolutionized the prospects of all industrial sectors -- today few industries rely purely on domestic markets or domestically produced components and raw materials.
4253,举例来说，虽然建筑业基本上是使用国内原料，雇用本土的劳动力和满足国内需求，但主要设备可能是进口的。而且，随着建筑公司国际所有权的增加，配套服务也许通过贸易才能实现。,"For example, although the construction industry primarily uses domestic materials, employs local labour and satisfies domestic demand, capital equipment may be imported and, with increasing international ownership of construction firms, support services may also be traded."
4254,笛卡儿则提出了一种不同的科学方法论，即重视演绎方法与数学逻辑。,Rene Descartes proposed a different approach to scientific methodology by emphasizing deduction and mathematical logic.
4254,笛卡儿相信，从一些几何公理般的自明真理出发，可以演绎出更为复杂的结论。,"Descartes believed that one could start with self-evident truths, comparable to geometrical axioms, and deduce more complex conclusions."
4254,他对演绎方法与数学秩序的强调弥补了培根关于试验与归纳法解释的不足。,His emphasis on deduction and mathematical order complemented Bacon’s stress on experiment and induction.
4254,牛顿综合培根的经验主义与笛卡儿的理性主义，倡导一种单一的科学方法。,It was Newton who synthesized them into a single scientific methodology by uniting Bacon’s empiricism with Descartes’ rationalism.
4254,这一科学方法要求最初做系统的观察与实验，以便得到一些一般性的概念。,"This scientific method began with systematic observations and experiments, which were used to arrive at general concepts."
4254,然后从这些一般性的概念出发得出演绎结果，再通过精确的实验来检验与证明这些结果的正确性，,New deductions derived from these general concepts could then be tested and verified by precise experiments.
4255,然而，多利弗这位雅各宾派的牧师则反对由这种情绪所形成的浪潮。,"However, a Jacobin cure from the neighborhood, Pierre Dolivier, had the courage to oppose this wave of sentiment."
4255,1792年5月，他向立法议会提出一个诉状，攻击被害者是一个富有而贪婪的人、一个谷物投机家，认为他的被杀是罪有应得。,"In May 1792 he presented to the Legislative Assembly a petition attacking the murdered victim as a rich and greedy figure, suggesting that he was a speculator in grain and that he roundly deserved his fate."
4255,在这一点上，多利弗不仅代表贫苦和饥饿的人民的权益要求控制物价，而且攻击财产权利本身。,"At this point Dolivier went on not only to ask for price controls on behalf of the poor and hungry but also to attack the right of property itsel： ""La nation seule est veritablement proprietaire de son terrain."""
4255,马希玆证正确地指出了多利弗思想中的古典因素。,Mathiez correctly points out the archaic element in Dolivier’s thinking.
4255,路易十四曾声称他是其臣民的财产的主人。,Louis XIV had claimed to be the master of the property of his subjects.
4255,现在国家已经继承了国王。,Now the nation had succeeded to the king.
4255,另一方面，在多利弗及其后继者的思想中，有一种看法给现代读者留下了深刻印象，即国家有责任使绝大部分不甚幸运的公民免遭饥饿之苦，而且这种责任要超过对私有财产权利的责任。,
4256,立宪议会处于不稳定的状态中。,The Constituent Assembly was in a ticklish position.
4256,其成员主要是在起义中被挽救的执法者。,Its members were mainly men of law and order who had been saved by a popular uprising.
4256,一般说来，那些富裕的财产所有者并不希望农民起义暴动。,Substantial property owners in general had no desire to see peasants on the rampage.
4256,但是，如果他们转向国王，或者转向王权机构中所残存的旨在恢复旧秩序的那些力量，他们就会为贵族中的顽固势力所利用，并且丧失革命给他们带来 的利益。,"But if they turned to the king and what was left of the royal apparatus to restore order, they would play into the hands of the intransigeant elements in the aristocracy and forfeit the gains of the Revolution."
4256,在这种情况下，少数人就操纵了议会，并通过了法令。,In this situation a minority managed to maneuver the Assembly into passing the decrees.
4257,如果全球化只是简单地被认为是电影制作能力和电影制作组织在全世界的发展，那么，说电影业已经出现了明确的全球化是很正确的。,"If globalization is taken to mean simply the diffusion of film-making capacities and organizations around the world, then it is fair to say that there has been a straightforward globalization of the film industry."
4257,根据联合国教科文组织所作的统计，西方国家和许多非西方国家都有了制作故事片的能力。,"According to statistical surveys undertaken by UNESCO, a significant number of nations both inside and outside the West have the capacity to produce feature films."
4257,然而很明显，只有非常少的国家能够制作大批量的电影。,"However, it is also clear that only a very few nations actually produce large numbers of films."
4258,第二次世界大战后，中国人离开大陆（1949年），东欧人在“匈牙利事件”（1956年）和“布拉格之春”（1968年）后奔向西欧。,"In the postwar era, refugees fled from communist revolutions in China (1949), from Eastern to Western Europe immediately after the war as well as after the uprisings in Hungary (1956) and Czechoslovakia (1968)."
4258,许多古巴人建立了一条逃往美国的稳定通道，而朝鲜战争（1950～1953年）和印度支那战争（1946〜1975年）都带来了难民流。,"The wars in Korea (1950-3) and Indo-China (1946-75) both produced a flood of refugees, while many Cubans steadily made the passage to the USA."
4258,联合国难民事务高级专员署估计，随着非殖民化过程以及建立新国家过程逐渐减慢，发展中国家的难民数量急剧上升，从50年代近200万增加到目前约2500万 - 3000万。,"UNHCR estimates suggest that the numbers of refugees in the developing world rose sharply as the process of decolonization and new state formation took off, from around 2 million in the 1950s to current levels of around 25-30 million."
4258,其中近1400万 〜 1500万发生在发展中国家内部（UNHCR， 1993； 1994，第3页）。,"Of this total around 14-15 million are displaced persons within their own state (UNHCR, 1993; 1994, p. 3)."
4259,13世纪，城镇和城市农产品需求量的上升导致物价上涨。,"By the thirteenth century, increasing demand for agricultural produce in the towns and cities led to higher food prices."
4259,这就激励领主多种粮食盈利。,This encouraged lords to try to grow more food for profit.
4259,盈利的方式之一就是将他们的领地租赁给农奴。,One way to do this was to lease their demesne land to their serfs.
4259,货币地租或固定的赋税取代了劳役，由此，许多不自由的农奴转变为自由农。,"Labor services were then transformed into money payments or fixed rents, thereby converting many unfree serfs into free peasants."
4259,尽管许多农民在经济上依然依附于他们的领主，但在法律上，他们已不再被束缚于土地上。,"Although many peasants still remained economically dependent on their lords, they were no longer legally tied to the land."
4260,从建立帝国的角度来说，即使在那些策略最终归于失败的地方，它仍可能留下了一种不同的文化遗产。,"Even where the strategy eventually failed in terms of empire building, it could leave a distinct cultural legacy."
4260,例如，亚历山大大帝统治的短命的马其顿帝国对于希腊语和古希腊科学、哲学和文学在近东的传播起了一定的作用。,"For example, the short-lived Macedonian empire of Alexander the Great was instrumental in the diffusion of the Greek language and Hellenistic science, philosophy and literature across the Near East."
4260,罗马帝国开始为希腊文化后来又为基督教能够渗入到北非、西欧和北欧提供了制度环境。,The Roman Empire provided the institutional context in which first Hellenic culture and then Christianity could percolate into North Africa and Western and Northern Europe.
4261,乌尔班六世当选之后，明确表示计划改革教会，甚至愿意用足够多的意大利新主教来削弱原来主教的力量，铲除强势的法国主教势力。,"Following his election, Urban VI made clear his plans to reform the papal curia and even to swamp the college of cardinals with enough new Italian cardinals to eliminate the French majority."
4261,当年夏天， 众多的法国主教从罗马撤出并最终脱离罗马暴民的控制。此后，他们发表了一个声明，宣称选举中他们受暴民胁迫，因而其选举完全不具效力，并推举他们当中的一员，一名法国人，就任教皇职位，即克雷芒七世，并立即返回阿维尼翁。,"After many of the cardinals (the French ones) withdrew from Rome in late summer and were finally free of the Roman mob, they issued a manifesto, saying that they had been coerced by the mob and that Urban's election was therefore null and void.The dissenting cardinals thereupon chose one of their number, a Frenchman, who took the title of Clement VII and promptly returned to Avignon."
4262,洛可可风格的一些典型特性在安东尼•华托（1684—1721）的作品中体现得非常明显。他对贵族生活有着一种抒情诗式的理解——优雅的，情欲的、彬彬有礼又衣着高雅的绅士和女士们，这是一种上层社会的愉悦又快乐的世界。,"Some of Rococo’s appeal is evident in the work of Antoine Watteau (1684--1721), whose lyrical views of aristocratic life--refined, sensual, civilized, with gentlemen and ladies in elegant dress-- revealed a world of upperclass pleasure and joy."
4262,然而，在这光鲜的外表下面，作者又隐含着一种忧郁的因素，揭示着愉悦、爱和生命的脆弱而又短暂的本性。,"Underneath that exterior, however, was an element of sadness as the artist revealed the fragility and transitory nature of pleasure, love, and life."
4263,全球数以亿计的人们都目睹了1991年围攻苏联冬宫的事件，同样目睹了1995年在北海，绿色和平组织是如何成功地阻止了英国壳牌公司凿沉毁坏一个巨型油库和浮标的命令（the Brent Spar）。,"Tens of millions of people, across every continent, witnessed what was happening in the siege of the Russian White House in 1991, and in the North Sea in 1995 when Greenpeace successfully challenged the UK Shell Corporation's bid to scuttle a giant oil storage and loading buoy (the Brent Spar)."
4263,电视镜头真实记录下这些正在发生的事件，使了解甚至参与这些事件成为可能。因此，尽管这些事件发生在特定的领域，它们却会迅速甚至直接地冲击世界的很多领域，这形成了国家和市民社会的机构对这些事件做出复杂和多样化的反应的基础。,"The fact that television cameras recorded these events as they were unfolding created access to, and involvement with, events which, although they took place in a specific locality, came to impinge quickly and directly on many parts of the world.This, in turn, formed the basis of complex and diverse reactions by agencies of the state and civil society."
4264,我非常怀疑在酿洒者与民主之间存在着什么联系，而且相信这是由于诺曼偶尔不加批判地套用欧洲的相似情況和马克思主义范畴的结果。,"I am rather skeptical of this alleged connection between brewing and democracy and believe that this is one of the rare points at which Norman applies European parallels and Marxi,st categories rather uncritically."
4264,日本的民主运动在19世纪70年代到80年代的失败，并不是较弱的商业阶级投身于封建贵族怀抱中，求得保护以反对工人所造成的结果，并不象马克思所说的，是权力与金钱的交易。,"The defeat of the Japanese democratic movement in the 1870s and 1880s was not one where a weak commercial class throws itself into the arms of the feudal aristocracy for protection against the workers, trading, as Marx says, the right to rule for the right to make money."
4264,日本不是徳国，至少在当时并不是！,"Japan was not Germany, at least not yet."
4265,如果世界像芒德尔—弗莱明理论描述的那样简单，那么，这些不同政策间的平衡将是明白清楚的。,"If the world was simply as described in the Mundell-Fleming theory, the tradeoffs between these different policies would be stark, but also clear."
4265,实际上，在这种政策和结果之间的可预测关系是脆弱的（Rose，1996）。,"In practice, the predicted relationships between policy and outcomes hold only weakly (Rose, 1996)."
4265,如前所述，在布雷顿森林体系下，资本流量仅对经合发国家的国内经济政策有有限的影响。,"Under the BWS, as noted, capital flows had only a limited impact on national economic policy in OECD countries."
4266,一旦人类分散到各个大陆，各个群体之间就失去了联系。随后几千年里，人类各种群封闭地生活在各自的大陆。,"Once human beings scattered to all the continents, they lost contact with each other and lived for thousands of years in isolation on their respective continents."
4266,这时，我们可以看到一个自相矛盾的现象：人类技术水平的发展不但导致了人类在早期的分散和封闭，而且在之后又使得他们逐渐交往，重归统一。,"Here we note the paradox that advances in human technology were responsible both for the early dispersal and isolation of human beings, and then for their later interaction and reunification."
4267,从1913〜1929年的大萧条期间，世界贸易仅以年均2.2%的速度增长，大约与产出一致，而关税水平也低于战前（Kitson和Michie，1995）。,"From 1913 up to the crash of 1929 world trade volumes grew at 2.2 per cent per annum, roughly in line with output, while tariff levels were not much greater than before the war (Kitson and Michie, 1995)."
4267,1929年大萧条以后，随着许多国家重筑壁垒、抛弃最惠国待遇原则、倾向歧视政策，贸易保护主义死灰复燃。,"Following the 1929 crash, protectionism became widespread as countries raised their trade barriers and abandoned the MFN principle in favour of discriminatory measures."
4267,因为许多国家力图将成本转移给其他国家而利用“损人利己”的保护政策，所以关税增加，壁垒森严。,Tariffs and other barriers escalated as countries used 'beggar-my-neighbour' protection in self-defeating attempts to pass on the costs of recession to each other.
4268,就历史水平而言，这些大贸易公司覆盖广泛，它们经营着17世纪和18世纪相当数量的大陆间贸易。,By historical standards these great trading companies were extensive and organized much of the intercontinental trade of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
4268,然而，如第3章指出的，这些贸易在很大程度上局限于奢侈品，并且在世界经济活动中仅占极小的比重。,"However, as noted in chapter 3, such trade was largely confined to luxury products and accounted for only a small proportion of world economic activity."
4268,此外，摆脱殖民主义加诸这些公司的广泛影响是非常困难的。,Beyond this it is difficult to disentangle the impact of these companies from the wider impact of colonialism.
4269,但是，国际贸易，即在国家间交换商品和服务，实际上只是伴随着民族国家的建立才出现的。,"But international trade, the exchange of goods and services between nations, by definition only emerged with the establishment of the nation-state."
4269,现代国家的成长，其财富的增加一直与贸易活动有关：国家需要收入以应付军事战争，而贸易则提供了明显的资金来源。,"Trade has been entwined with the rise of the modern state and its fortunes: states required revenues, above all to wage military campaigns, and trade offered an obvious source of funds."
4269,本章的主要目标是区分贸易全球化的历史模式，而且这要使用本书导论中建构的分析框架。,"Identifying historical patterns of trade globalization is the primary objective of this chapter, and this entails deploying the analytical framework developed in the introduction."
4270,萨克斯和华纳（1995）发现，从60年代到80年代后期，在全世界范围内，采取广义的贸易开放政策的经济体在人口数量上稳定在不足世界人口总量的1/4，国内生产总值不足世界国内生产总值的一半。,Sachs and Warner (1995) found that from 1960 until the late 1980s the proportion of the world's economies that could be classed as operating broadly open trade policies was stable at below a quarter measured by population and less than a half measured by GDP.
4270,从那时起，二者的比例分别上升到一半以上和大约2/3。在中国加入世贸组织以后，这个数字还会上升。所以，贸易自由化趋势将持续下去。,"Since then the proportions have risen to over a half and around two-thirds respectively, figures that will rise still further when China is admitted to the WTO and so long as the trend towards trade liberalization continues."
4271,在每一次侵略之后，都有可能出现破坏、强制移民、征服以及瘟疫。,"Devastation, forced migration, conquest and plague tended to follow each wave of invasion."
4271,实际上，当这个时代结束的时候，前一个千年建立的许多长距离联系已经消失或弱化了。最后的结果是14世纪大范围流行的黑死病危机以及蒙古帝国的分裂和最终崩溃。,"Indeed, this era closes with the dissolution and weakening of many of the long-distance connections established in the prior millennium, fractured as a result of the fourteenth-century crises of the pandemic Black Death and the destruction and final fall of the Mongol empire."
4272,忽略那些为反动目的服务（用一种便利的理由为他们的既得特权辩护）的革命口号的出现是错误的。,It would be a mistake to dismiss the appearance of revolutionary slogans in the service of a reactionary cause as no more than an instance of selfish privilege seeking to justify itself by any convenient argument.
4272,首先，正是孟德斯鸠在他著名的干预理论中为官职出售进行了辩护。,"For one thing, no less a mind than Montesquieu's defended the sale of offices as part of his famous theory of intervening powers."
4272,正如格林所指出的，财产神圣不可侵犯和个人自由的观念在这种具体的历史条件下得到了有力的推动。顽固的贵族依靠他们反动特权的帮助从而推动革命思想发展，这种事例并不是空前绝后的。,"As Gohring points out, the conceptions of the inviolability of property and freedom of the individual received a.powerful impulse from this concrete historical situation” This was neither the first nor the last occasion when a stubborn aristocracy clinging to reactionary privileges helped to set in motion revolutionary ideas."
4272,而要找出明显的例证来说明18世纪晚期标志着法国特点的官僚政治，封建主义和资本主义的相互渗透，这比说明上述革命思想何以在这种环境下产生出来更为困难。,"Still it would be difficult to find a sharper illustration of the interpenetration of bureaucratic, feudal, and capitalist features characterizing French society in the late eighteenth century than the appearance of such ideas in this context."
4273,凡在上述征收范围之外，余等如欲征收贡金与免役税，应用加盖印信之诏书致送各大主教、住持、伯爵与男爵指明时间与地点召集会议，以期获得全国公意。此项诏书之送达，至少应在开会以前四十日。此外，余等仍应通过执行史与管家吏普遍召集凡直接领有余等之土地者。召集之缘由应于诏书内载明。,"And for holding a common council of the kingdom concerning the assessment of an aid otherwise than in the three cases mentioned above, or concerning the assessment of a scutage we shall cause to be summoned the archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls, and greater barons by our letters under seal; and besides we shall cause to be summoned generally, by our sheriffs and bailiffs all those who hold from us in chief, for a certain day, that is at the end of forty days at least, and for a certain place; and in all the letters of that summons, we will express the cause of the summons, and when the summons has thus been given the business shall proceed on the appointed day, on the advice of those who shall be present, even if not all of those who were summoned have come. . . ."
4273,召集之后，前项事件应在指定日期依出席者之公意进行，不以缺席人数阻延之。,
4274,我们可以把民主化进程归纳为3次“浪潮”（同时伴随着一些明显的挫折），这3次浪潮展现了随着时间的流逝，自由民主是如何得到巩固和最终得以完成的。第一次浪潮是从19世纪早期到20世纪20年代的中期；第二次浪潮是从第二次世界大战到20世纪60年代早期；第三次则是从1974年以来至今（参见专栏1-1; Huntington， 1991）。,"It is possible to distinguish three ‘waves’ of democratization (with some notable concomitant setbacks) which have marked out the consolidation and reach of liberal democracy over time; the first from the early nineteenth century to the mid-1920s; the second from the Second World War to the early 1960s; and the third from 1974 onwards (see box 1.1; Huntington, 1991)."
4274,最近的这次民主化浪潮帮助确立了自由民主在世界许多地区的主导地位。,The most recent wave helped secure a dominant position for liberal democracy across many of the world’s regions.
4275,它试图指出在一个有既定领土的共同体中，政治权威不仅有权决定规则 、管制以及政策的框架，而且有权根据这个框架进行统治。,"It seeks to specify the political authority within a community which has the right to determine the framework of rules, regulations and policies within a given territory and to govern accordingly."
4275,然而，如果考虑到全球化对现代民族国家的影响，有必要把主权（统治固定领土的权力）与国家自主（民族国家实际拥有的独立宣布和实现自己政策目标的权力）区别开来。,"However, in thinking about the impact of globalization on the modern nation-state, one needs to distinguish the claim to sovereignty - the entitlement to rule over a bounded territory - from state autonomy - the actual power the nation-state possesses to articulate and achieve policy goals independently."
4275,实际上，国家自主指的是国家代表、管理者以及代理人表达和追求自己的政策偏好的能力，即便这些偏好有时可能与国内和国际社会力量的要求和条件发生冲突（ Nordlinger，1981）。,"In effect, state autonomy refers to the capacity of state representatives, managers and agencies to articulate and pursue their policy preferences even though these may on occasion clash with the dictates of domestic and international social forces and conditions (Nordlinger, 1981)."
4276,这当然不是说移民的公民地位问题可以避而不谈，相反，正是这种不做明确决定的态度使得移民被高度边缘化并被排斥，并便人们对这个问题保持政治沉默。在这种政治沉默的庇护下，越来越多的地方种族歧视得以存在。,"This does not mean of course that the civic status of migrants is side-stepped; rather, it is a non-decision that ensures a high degree of marginalization and exclusion, and a cloak of political silence under which a more local racism can be practised."
4276,从广义上讲，排他性模式是一种种族国家主义模式，在这种种族关系下，种族地位和语言状况是公民身份的基础。,"The exclusionary model is broadly a model of ethnic nationalism in which kin, ethnic and linguistic status provide the basis of citizenship."
4276,在瑞士、德国和比利时，这种模式非常流行，移民主要是通过规范化的客籍工人计划来到这些国家的。,"In Switzerland, Germany and Belgium, where this model has tended to prevail, migrants have arrived primarily through highly regulated guest-worker programmes."
4277,1850到1871年间，民族国家成为人们效忠的对象。,"Between 1850 and 1871, the national state became the focus of people’s loyalty."
4277,无论是内战还是外战都被用来创建统一的民族国家。,"Wars, both foreign and civil, were fought to create unified nation-states."
4277,政治民族主义在法国大革命时代就已出现。在19世纪前半段就成为推动变革的一种强有力的力量，但是直到1850年之后它的成就才逐渐显露出来。,"Political nationalism had emerged during the French revolutionary era and had become a powerful force of change during the first half of the nineteenth century, but its triumph came only after 1850."
4278,尽管巴黎和会被认为是遵循民族自治原则的，但是在东欧，民族的混杂使得沿着严格的民族界线划定边界成为不可能。,"Although the Paris Peace Conference was supposedly guided by the principle of self-determination, the mixtures of peoples in eastern Europe made it impossible to draw boundaries along neat ethnic lines."
4278,作为妥协的结果，实际上每个东欧国家中都留有一些少数民族问题，可能在未来会引发冲突。,"As a result of compromises, virtually every eastern European state was left with a minorities problem that could lead to future conflicts."
4278,波兰的德意志人，捷克斯洛伐克的匈牙利人、波兰人和德意志人，以及南斯拉夫内部塞尔维亚人、克罗地亚人、斯洛文尼亚人、马其顿人和阿尔巴尼亚人的混居，这些都是未来冲突的源泉。,"Germans in Poland; Hungarians, Poles, and Germans in Czechoslovakia; and Serbs, Croats, Slovenes, Macedonians, and Albanians in Yugoslavia all became sources of later conflict."
4279,凡此种种，并不意味着从16世纪以后，无情的命运把德国驱向法西斯主义是一种不可逆转的进程。,"All this does not of course mean that some inexorable fate drove Germany toward fascism from the sixteenth century onward, that the process never could have been reversed."
4279,还有其它因素会介入进来。其中十分重要的，是19世纪工业化起歩阶段各种力量的聚集，我们会在后面谈到这个问题。,"Other factors had to intervene, some very important ones, as industrialization began to gather momentum during the nineteenth century.About these it will be necessary to speak in a moment."
4279,导致法西斯主义的一般道路，存在着几种重要的分支和替换类型。以学术语言简而言之，也即是说自上而下的革命导致的保守型现代化主要选择模式中，存在着若干次一级的子模式。,"There are also significant variants and substitutions within the general pattern that has led to fascism, subalternatives one might say if one wished to be very precise and technical, within the major alternative of conservative modernization through revolution from above."
4279,在日本，对上级全面承担职责的观念来自封建领主，而不是政治天平另一端的皇权。,"In Japan the notion of total commitment to authority apparently came out of the feudal, rather than the monarchical, side of the equation."
4279,在意大利，当法西斯主义应时而起，这里却缺少强有力的全国性王权。,"Again in Italy, where fascism was invented, there was no powerful national monarchy."
4279,墨索里尼只能追溯到古罗马去寻找相应的象征。,Mussolini had to go all the way back to ancient Rome for the corresponding symbolism.
4280,通过德川家族的各个支脉和亲藩大名，幕府拥有全国1/5到1/4的农业土地，从中搜刮大批的财物。,"Together with various branches of the Tokugawa family and his immediate vassals, the Shogun possessed between one-fourth and one-fifth of the agricultural land of the country deriving the major part of his resources from this source."
4280,将军指定了百十名领取薪俸的地方长官，以管理他的领地。因此，与同时期的欧洲一样，日本的封建制度也注入了强有力的官僚制度的因素。,"To manage his domain lands, he appointed about forty intendents with regular salaries.Thus, as also in Western Europe at the same time, there was a strong bureaucratic infusion in Japanese feudalism."
4281,每个本笃会修道士受到掌握着绝对权威的修道院院长或者叫修道院的“父亲”的严格控制，每个修道士要绝对服从院长的意志。,"Each Benedictine monastery was strictly ruled by an abbot, or ""father"" of the monastery, who held complete authority over them; unquestioning obedience to the will of the abbot was expected of each monk."
4281,每个本笃会修道院拥有土地，使其能够自给自足， 与世隔绝却能独立存在。,
4281,问题：关键术语没有翻译出来改1：每个本笃会修道士受到掌握着绝对权威的男修道院院长或者叫修道院的“父亲”的严格控制，每个修道士要绝对服从院长的意志。,
4281,每个本笃会修道院拥有土地，使其能够自给自足， 与世隔绝却能独立存在。,"Each Benedictine monastery owned lands that enabled it to be a self-sustaining community, isolated from and independent of the world surrounding it."
4282,随便看一下迁移起源的原因同样可以表明这一点。,
4282,,A casual glance at the origins of migrations suggests as much.
4282,征服和殖民的军事全球化模式产生了胜利的殖民者向被打败的社会的新的流动，或逃难者从战争区域向避难地的流动。,"Patterns of military globalization, of conquest and colonization, generate new streams of colonizers from victorious to defeated societies or of refugees from war zones to places of asylum."
4282,因此，正如我们可以预见到的，全球的和区域的迁移模式对迁入和迁出社会的影响通常是多方面的。,"Accordingly, the impact of global and regional patterns of migration on host and home societies is, as we might expect, often multifaceted."
4283,英国革命战胜了君主专制制度，使带有资产阶级思想的大地主腾出手来，在18、19世纪一举消灭了农民阶级。,The English Civil War checked royal absolutism and gave the commercially minded big landlords a free hand to play their part during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in destroying peasant society.
4283,法国革命打破了尚未进入商品经济领域的土地贵族的权力，但在一定阶段上，又反过来开始要求新的强制力量，以约束和控制自己的劳动力。,"The French Revolution broke the power of a landed elite that was still mainly precommercial, though sections of it had begun to go over to new forms requiring repressive mechanisms to maintain its labor force."
4283,在这层意义上，正如刚才提到的，法国革命建立了另一条路线，开创了一个逐渐趋向民主的社会。,"In this sense, as already noted, the French Revolution constituted an alternative way of creating institutions eventually favorable to democracy."
4283,美国内战同样消灭了种植园主的力量，这种力量一度作为资本主义的一部分兴起，到这时却成为民主进一步发展的障碍。,"Finally, the American Civil War likewise broke the power of a landed elite that was an obstacle in the way of democratic advance but, in this case, one that had grown up as part of capitalism."
4284,在本章中，我还将进一歩指出：16世纪，德国东部农民遭到反动庄园和再度实行的农奴制的压榨，他们不曾投身于流血暴动。倒是德国东部和西部的农民爆发了起义，而他们在很大程度上保存并延续了往昔的生活方式。,"Again, as I shall have occasion to point out in more detail later in this chapter, it was not the peasants of eastern Germany rolled under by the manorial reaction and the reintroduction of serfdom who turned to bloody revolt in the sixteenth century but those of the south and west, who by and large retained and even extended their old way of life."
4284,在适当的地方，我们将指出，与上述论点相反的假设也同样接近于历史的真实。,"Indeed the very opposite hypothesis comes closer to the truth, as we shall see in due course."
4285,除了法律和秩序，19世纪英国人还把铁路和大量的灌溉系统引入印度。,"In addition to law and order, the British introduced into Indian society during the nineteenth century railroads and a substantial amount of irrigation."
4285,农业的商业化和工业増长最重要的先决条件似乎已经具备。,The most important prerequisites for commercial agriculture and industrial growth would seem to have been present.
4285,然而，这种所谓的增长最终证明是软弱无力的乃至先败的。,
4285,,Yet what growth there was turned out to be abortive and sickly.
4286,为保证对拉哥尼亚和美西尼亚奴隶的统治，斯巴达人有意识地决定建立军事国家。,"To ensure control over their conquered Laconian and Messenian helots, the Spartans decided to create a military state."
4286,公元前6世纪早期，他们把斯巴达改造成了军事营地（见附文）。,"By the early sixth century B.C., they had transformed Sparta into a military camp (see the box on p. 48)."
4286,全体斯巴达人的生活具有严格的组织性。,The lives of all Spartans were now rigidly organized.
4287,大西洋的奴隶贸易持续了400多年，从15世纪中叶一直到19世纪中叶。,"The Atlantic slave trade persisted for over four hundred years, from the mid-fifteenth century to the mid-nineteenth century."
4287,大西洋奴隶贸易是建立在印度洋盆地大规模的奴隶贸易基础上并与之相关联，后者将东非和中东、奥斯曼帝国和欧洲在印度洋的殖民地连接在一起。,"It built on, and intersected with, an extensive slave trade in the Indian Ocean basin tying East Africa to the Middle East, the Ottoman Empire and European colonies in the Indian Ocean."
4287,虽然像往常一样数据不完整，但是，估计的数字表明，在1500〜1900年间，从非洲的东北部、东部和中部地区运往中东和阿拉伯半岛的人口约有430万（Clarence-Smith，1989）。,"As ever, data is sketchy, but estimates suggest that between 1500 and 1900 around 4.3 million people were taken from north east, east and central Africa to the Middle East and the Arabian peninsula (Clarence-Smith, 1989)."
4288,但是，奴隶制的存在对于政治民主和社会民主的建立，是一道障碍。这种理解不够明确。,But slavery was an obstacle to a political and social democracy.
4288,有些模糊不淸的理解是论据本身引起的，它们将在我后面的分析中重点谈到；有些则更加隐晦，无论拿出多少证据也无法使它变得淸晰，这一点大家在本章末还可看到。,"There are ambiguities in this interpretation.Those that stem from the character of the evidence are best discussed as the analysis proceeds.Others lie deeper and, as I shall try to show at the end of the chapter, would not disappear no matter what evidence came to light."
4289,与伊斯兰教的传播一样，它们是唯一具有全球广度的重要因素的社会交往形式。,"These were, alongside the spread of Islam, the only forms of social interaction to achieve significant elements of global extensity."
4289,与后来的时代相比，前现代的全球化可能最好被描绘为一种“稀疏全球化”（请参见导论）。,"Compared with subsequent eras, globalization in the premodern period might be best described as a form of ‘thin globalization’（see the introduction)."
4289,大洋洲和美洲的文明依然与欧亚和非洲文明隔绝。,The civilizations of Oceania and America remained separate from Eurasia and Africa.
4290,在世界大部分地区，都有一种对应的法律结构和机制。,Within most of the world's regions there is an equivalent legal structure and machinery.
4290,例如在欧洲，欧洲人权委员会、欧洲人权法院和欧洲安全与合作组织监督着人权问题，对践踏人权的行为进行审判。,"In the case of Europe, the European Commissioner for Human Rights, the European Court of Human Rights and the Organization for Security and Cooperation inEurope (OSCE) oversee human rights issues and adjudicate on abuses."
4290,非洲的《班珠尔宪章》和美洲的美洲国家组织所属的美洲国家间人权委员会也有相似的功能。,
4290,非洲的《班珠尔宪章》和美洲的美洲国家组织所属的美洲国家间人权委员会也有相似的功能。,"In Africa, the Banjul Charter, and in the Americas, the Inter-American Committee on Human Rights of the Organization of American States (OAS), have similar functions."
4290,各种各样的非政府组织在推动人权方面也同样重要，如大赦国际（又译“国际特赦协会”）、人权联盟和国际法学家委员会。,"But perhaps as significant in promoting human rights, if not more so, are the multiplicity of international non-governmental organizations such as Amnesty International, the League of Human Rights and the International Commission of Jurists."
4291,1979年建立的欧洲货币体制（EMS）在70年代通过“蛇形浮动”在其中确定利率的尝试失败后，为欧共体国家提供了一个固定汇率体制。,The European Monetary System (EMS) was founded in 1979 to provide a fixed exchange rate system for European Community countries following abortive attempts to fix rates between them in the 1970s through the 'snake'.
4291,汇率机制为参与国家提供了正式的工具，把每种货币的浮动限制在协商的±2.25%之内，并且为成员国提供了干预的程序，防止任何货币脱离限制。,"The Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) provided the formal apparatus for the participating countries, limiting fluctuations of each currency to 2.25 per cent either side of an agreed value, and providing procedures for member countries to intervene to support any currency moving towards the edge of its band."
4291,1993年欧洲货币体制危机之后，浮动范围扩大到±15%。,Following the EMS crisis in 1993 these bands were widened to 15 per cent.
4292,尽管宣言还不具有合法的约束力，但它已被广泛地看作正在创立一种国际法的未来的发展轨道。,"While the Declaration is not yet legally binding, it is widely regarded as establishing a future trajectory of international law."
4292,在其他的背景下，寻求对少数群体的权利的保护的推动也特别值得一提。,"In other contexts, the impetus to secure protection for minority rights is particularly noteworthy."
4292,在欧洲理事会内部，《地区和少数语言宪章》和《保护少数民族框架公约》（已被详尽地阐述。,"Within the Council of Europe, a Charter for Regional and Minority Languages and a Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities have been elaborated."
4293,黑帮运动的出现同这一时局背道而驰，他们在一定程度上学习了美国经验，把“私刑”一词导入俄语语汇，力倡私刑审讯。,"Against this background appeared the Black Hundreds movement.Drawing partly on American experience, they made ""lynch"" into a Russian word and asked for the application of zakon lyncha, lynch law."
4293,他们凭藉暴力手段，雷厉风行地镇压所谓“卖国”与 “叛乱”行为。,"They resorted to violence in storm-trooper style to suppress ""treason"" and ""sedition."""
4293,他们在宣传中声言：如果俄国人把犹太人和外国人扫地出门，一切人都将回到“真正的俄国方式”中快乐地生活。,"If Russia could destroy the ""kikes"" and foreigners, their propaganda asserted, everyone could live happily in a return to ""true Russian"" ways."
4293,这种反犹主义诉诸于落后状态，诉诸于前资本主义势力，诉诸于城市中的小资产阶级分子和少数贵族分子。,"This anti-Semitic nativism had considerable appeal to backward, precapitalist, petty bourgeois elements in the cities and among the smaller nobility."
4294,巴黎和会上的最终和约包括与五个战败国分别签订的五份和约，五国分别是德国、奥地利和匈牙利（现在是分立的两国了）、保加利亚和土耳其。,"The final peace settlement of Paris consisted of five separate treaties with the defeated nations---Germany, Austria and Hungary (now separate nations), Bulgaria, and Turkey."
4294,1919年6月28日签订的对徳和约是最重要的一份。,
4294,,"The Treaty of Versailles with Germany, signed on June 28, 1919, was by far the most important one."
4294,德国人认为这是一个令人难以接受的和平，尤其对第231条款感到不满，这就是所谓的战争条款，该条款宣布徳国（和奥地利）对发动战争负有责任，要求德国对协约国政府和人民因战争所遭受的所有损失支付赔款。,"The Germans considered it a harsh peace and were particularly unhappy with Article 231, the so-called War Guilt Clause, which declared Germany (and Austria) responsible for starting the war and ordered Germany to pay reparations for all the damage the Allied governments and their people suffered as a result of the war."
4295,接下来的50年呈现出两个重要特征：权势人物角逐权力和由此引起的内战。,"For the next fifty years, Roman history would be characterized by two important features: the jostling for power by a number of strong individuals and the civil wars generated by their conflicts."
4295,有三个重要人物把持着大量的军队和政权，分别是克拉苏、庞培和尤利乌斯•恺撒。,"Three men came to hold enormous military and political power -- Crassus, Pompey, and Julius Caesar."
4295,克拉苏是罗马最富有的人，他成功镇压了斯巴达克斯领导的奴隶大起义。,"Crassus, who was known as the richest man in Rome, had successfully put down the major slave rebellion led by Spartacus."
4295,庞培是从西班牙凯旋归来的将军，被奉为军事英雄。,Pompey had returned from a successful military command in Spain in 71 B.C. and had been hailed as a military hero.
4295,尤利乌斯•恺撒是从民众的代言人开始其政治生涯的，掌握着西班牙的军队。,Julius Caesar had been a spokesman for the populares from the beginning of his political career and had a military command in Spain.
4295,公元前60年，恺撒联合克拉苏与庞培结成了同盟，史称前三头执政。,"In 60 B.C., Caesar joined with Crassus and Pompey to form a coalition that historians call the First Triumvirate."
4296,婆罗门的种种要求和强征勒索是公元前6世纪和5世纪印度进行宗教改革的一个因素。另一因素是上文提到过的经济发展，经济发展造成一个富裕的商人等级即吠舍种姓，吠舍种姓对在它之上的两个种姓享有种种特权极为怨恨。,"The Brahman pretensions and exactions were one factor in the religious reformation in India in the sixth and fifth centuries B.C. Another was the economic growth noted above, which created a wealthy merchant, or Vaishya, caste that resented the special privileges enjoyed by the two upper castes."
4296,最后，婆罗门与非雅利安人之间的关系非常紧张，因为虽然非雅利安人可以被吸收为印度教信徒，但他们对祭士居支配地位很不满。,Finally there was the tension between the Brahmans and the non-Aryans who had been admitted to the Hindu fold but who resented the priestly domination.
4297,此外，尽管有徳川政府的中央集权制，我们涉及的日本封建单位，仍然处于分裂状态。,"Furthermore, despite the centralization of the Tokugawa government, the feudal units in Japan still retained their separate identities as going concerns."
4297,日本的各藩是独立的细胞，如果它们从徳川政治总体中分离出来的话，它们或许会更好地生存下去。,The Japanese fiefs were independent cells that probably could have survived reasonably well if they had been separated from the Tokugawa body politic.
4297,各藩的藩主从德川统治的和平年代里得以安全地享受贵族特权。,What their leaders derived from the pax Tokugawa was the peaceful enjoyment of aristocratic privilege.
4297,当整个制度受到突然袭击时，一些封建主要使自己从这一制度中脱身出来，发动一场政变并不是件十分困难的事情。,"When the system as a whole was suddenly threatened, it was not too difficult for a few of the feudatories to detach themselves and execute a coup d^etat."
4297,因此，王政复古犹如一场成功的法国投石党运动。,Thus the Imperial Restoration had some of the characteristics of a successful Fronde.
4297,但正如索尔斯坦•维布伦50年前在他的著作《德意志帝国和工业革命》一书中所注意到的，与日本更为接近的是普鲁士。,"But a better parallel, and one noticed nearly fifty years ago by Thorstein Veblen in his Imperial Germany and the Industrial Revolution, would be Prussia."
4298,上面所列的各点有助于澄清全球化的特定含义。,The points set out above help clarify the meaning of globalization in very specific ways.
4298,尤其是它们注意到把全球化等同于相互依存、整合、普世主义以及趋同这些概念的危险。,"In particular, they draw attention to the dangers of eliding globalization with concepts such as interdependence, integration, universalism and convergence."
4298,虽然相互依存概念假定社会或政治行为者在权力关系上是对称的，但是全球化概念承认存在等级和不平衡，也就是全球分层过程的可能性。,"Whereas the concept of interdependence assumes symmetrical power relations between social or political actors, the concept of globalization leaves open the possibility of hierarchy and unevenness; that is, a process of global stratification."
4298,整合也有非常专门的意思，因为它指的是经济和政治的统一过程，在这个过程中出现了共同体感、共同的命运以及共同的治理制度。,"Integration too has a very specific meaning since it refers to processes of economic and political unification which prefigure a sense of community, shared fortunes and shared institutions of governance."
4299,七国集团的集会明显地说明一个已经存在已久的事实：随着政府及其公民认识到一个跨国的流动和联系的世界的存在，全球政治的“制度化”正在进一步形成。,The G7 summits highlight what has been evident for some time: a growing 'institutionalization' of global politics as governments and their citizens come to terms with a world of transnational flows and connections.
4299,这种全球政治的制度化并不是20世纪所特有的一个现象。,This kind of institutionalization is not simply a twentieth-century phenomenon.
4299,正如前面详细描述的，从19世纪中叶以来，管理全球事务各个方面的国际机制就已经初露端倪（如果把“权力的制衡”算作是这种机制之一，那就更早了，见第2章）。,"As highlighted previously, international mechanisms to 'govern' aspects of global affairs have been in evidence since the middle of the nineteenth century (and long before that if one counts the 'balance of power' as such a mechanism: see chapter 2)."
4300,英国有现成的资本用于投资购买新的工业机器和建造厂房。,Britain had a ready supply of capital for investment in the new industrial machines and the factories that were needed to house them.
4300,在商业和棉花工业所带来的利润之外，英国拥有一个高效的中央银行，以及发展成熟、灵活应变的信贷体系。,"In addition to profits from trade and the cottage industry, Britain had an effective central bank and well-developed, flexible credit facilities."
4300,许多早期的工厂主都是在18世纪的棉花工业中获利的商人或企业家。,Many early factory owners were merchants and entrepreneurs who had profited from the eighteenth-century cottage industry.
4300,问题：信息缺漏；错译改1：英国有现成的资本用于投资购买新的工业机器、建造用来放置机器的厂房。,
4300,在商业和棉花工业所带来的利润之外，英国拥有一个高效的中央银行，以及完善、灵活的信贷服务。,
4300,许多早期的厂主都是在18世纪的棉花工业中获利的商人或企业家。,
4301,汽车工业无疑是战后经济繁荣期间的主导工业。,The car industry was arguably the lead industry during the postwar economic boom.
4301,美国的生产商，如福特和通用公司早已建立了经营机制。但是第二次世界大战后，它们的国际扩张，特别是进军欧洲市场的势头前所未有。,"US producers, such as Ford and General Motors, had established operations, but the postwar period witnessed their unprecedented international expansion, into Europe particularly."
4301,随着美国公司在欧洲和其他地方建立大规模的生产装配线，国内由场保护和运输成本使外同直接投资成为服务这些市场的明显方式。,Protection of national markets and transport costs made FDI the obvious tool for serving these markets as US firms replicated mass production assembly lines in Europe and elsewhere.
4301,虽然大公司成功地赢得了市场份额，但在受保护的欧洲市场内，政府支持的国内竞争者出现了。,"Although the big firms succeeded in gaining significant market shares, within protected European markets national competitors emerged, often championed by their governments."
4302,不管是实际上还是在各国和国际模糊的迁移统计领域，这些种类之间的区別都是模糊不清的。,"The distinctions between these categories are ever more blurred, both in reality and in the murky world of national and international migration statistics."
4302,这些流动既出现在经合组织成员国和发展中国家之间，也发生在发展中国家范围内。,These movements of people occur between OECD and developing states and within the developing world itself.
4302,它们的起因是复杂的。,Their roots are complex.
4303,然而，这些国家渐渐成了缓冲区，迁移者（在前苏联和巴尔干半岛，迁移者已经开始进一步往南和往东迁移）在试图进一步往西迁移时，都先在这里停留一段时间。,"However, these states have increasingly become buffer zones, where migratory flows (that have begun further south and east, in the states of the ex-Soviet Union and in the Balkans) pause before attempting to travel further westwards."
4303,1991年，估计波兰有70万外籍工人，许多人正努力继续向西的迁移。,"In 1991, Poland had an estimated 700,000 foreign workers, many seeking to continue their journey west."
4303,自第二次世界大战以来，前南斯拉夫的国内战争造成大量的欧洲迁移人口进一步向南迁移。,Further south the civil war in the former Yugoslavia has generated the largest numbers of displaced persons in Europe since the Second World War.
4304,现代早期，武器贸易几乎全部发生在每个分立的世界文明领域之内。,In the premodern era the trade in arms occurred almost exclusively within the confines of separate world civilizations.
4304,例如，巴特莱特描述了在950年到1350年期间，法兰克人的武器和军事技术（比如城堡防御技术和炮击技术）是如何扩展到整个欧洲的（1994，第70〜84页）。,"Bartlett, for instance, describes how in the period 950-1350 Frankish arms and military technology (such as castles and bombardment techniques) spread across Europe (1994, pp. 70-84)."
4304,通过征服和竞争，城堡、围城器械和弓弩成为欧洲战争的常用武器。,"By means of conquest and emulation, castles, siege machinery and crossbows became familiar instruments of medieval warfare within Europe."
4305,起初，新石器时代的居住形式仅仅是村落，但是随着居住者渐渐掌握了耕种技术，更加复杂的人类社会开始出现。,"At first, Neolithic settlements were mere villages.But as their inhabitants mastered the art of farming, more complex human societies began to emerge."
4305,伴随着财富的增加，社会衍生出了军队并且开始出现了带围墙的城市和城镇。,"As wealth increased, these societies began to develop armies and to build walled towns and cities."
4305,到青铜时代开始时，大量人口集中在美索不达米亚和埃及河谷，开创了一种全新的人类生活方式。,"By the beginning of the Bronze Age, the concentration of larger numbers of people in the river valleys of Mesopotamia and Egypt was leading to a whole new pattern for human life."
4306,一系列国际条约已经有效禁止了有害垃圾倾倒入海，而且禁止在海洋中焚烧垃圾。,A series of international treaties have effectively banned the dumping of hazardous wastes at sea and completely phased out the sea-based incineration option.
4306,在陆地上，控制垃圾焚烧的规定已经防止了许多有害垃圾被存放在不恰当的地方。,"On land, regulations governing the management of landfill sites have prevented many hazardous wastes from being stored in inappropriate sites."
4306,这为人们提供了回收垃圾以及焚烧垃圾的选择。,This has left recycling and land-based incineration options.
4307,18世纪大土地主所拥有的政治和经济的特权部分地是由国内战争以前的某些倾向所造成的。这些倾向主要是:地方显贵的权威，以及缺乏一种强有力的机构来限制这种权威，甚至在都铎和斯图亚特王朝时代也是如此。,"The political and economic supremacy of the larger landlords during the eighteenth century was partly the result of trends that long antedate the Civil War, chiefly the authority of local notables and the absence of a strong bureaucratic apparatus to check this authority, even under the Tudors and the Stuarts."
4307,国内战争的结果与法国大革命的成果形成了鲜明的对照，它加强了上层土地所有者的地位。,"The outcome of the Civil War itself, in sharp contrast to that of the French Revolution, was to strengthen greatly the position of the landed upper classes."
4307,我们始终可以看到某些证据，证明在清教徒革命期间土地所有者的分布情况只有一些很小的变动，除了少数特殊情况之外。,There has already been occasion to notice some evidence indicating relatively little change in the distribution of landed property during the Puritan Revolution.
4307,1640年居住于北安普敦郡和贝得福郡的大家族在一个世纪之后仍居住于原地。,"With only two exceptions, all the great families that were in Northamptonshire and Bedfordshire in 1640 were still there a century later."
4308,正因为穆斯林社会是穆罕默德天才的结晶，所以他死后，这一社会也就面临着分裂的危险。,"Precisely because the Moslem community was the product of Mohammed’s genius, it now seemed likely with his death to break up into its component dements."
4308,部落酋长们认为他们对穆罕默德的服从已经随着他的死亡而完结。于是，他们停止纳贡，恢复行动自由。,"The tribal sheikhs, who considered their submission to him ended with his death, stopped their tribute and resumed their freedom of action."
4309,对这些概念进行更精确的定义，关键是要表明，全球化在这里与更有空间限制的过程不是对立关系，而是复合和动态的关系。,"In offering a more precise definition of these concepts it is crucial to signal that globalization is not conceived here in opposition to more spatially delimited processes but, on the contrary, as standing in a complex and dynamic relationship with them."
4309,—方面，像区域化这样的过程能够创造必要的经济、社会以及物质基础，它们推动并且补充着全球化的深入。,"On the one hand, processes such as regionalization can create the necessary kinds of economic, social and physical infrastructures which facilitate and complement the deepening of globalization."
4309,在这方而，经济区域化（例如欧盟）并不是贸易和生产全球化的障碍，而是推动力。,"In this regard, for example, economic regionalization (for instance, the European Union) has not been a barrier to the globalization of trade and production but a spur."
4309,另一方面，这样的过程如果没有鼓励解全球化 的过程，那么也能够限制全球化。,"On the other hand, such processes can impose limits to globalization, if not encouraging a process of deglobalization."
4310,撒哈拉以南非洲在战后出现了重要的全球性迁移流，主要是迁往前殖民国家：尼日利亚、坦桑尼亚和乌干达人迁往英国；中非和西非人迁往法国；扎伊尔人迁往比利时（Curtin， 1978; Castles 和 Miller， 1993）。,"Sub-Saharan Africa has generated significant global flows of migrants in the postwar era, mainly to ex-colonial states: Nigerian, Tanzanian and Ugandan Asians have migrated to the UK; Central and West Africans to France; Zairians to Belgium (Curtin, 1978; Castles and Miller, 1993)."
4310,然而，经合组织认为，这些迁移与非洲内部的区域性迁移相比相形见绌（经济合作与发展组织， 1993a）。,"However, the OECD has argued that these movements are dwarfed by regional migrations within Africa (OECD, 1993a)."
4310,区域性的劳动力迁移主要是流向尼日利亚、南非、加蓬和象牙海岸。,"Regional labour migrations have flowed primarily to Nigeria, South Africa, Gabon and the Ivory Coast."
4311,冷战结束以后，在欧洲以外，区域关系的制度化速度显著加快，如美洲、亚太地区，以及程度稍慢的非洲。,"Since the end of the Cold War, there has been a significant acceleration in the institutionalization of regional relations beyond Europe: in the Americas, Asia-Pacific and, to a lesser degree, in Africa."
4311,但是这样的区域主义所采取的形式却与欧盟的一体化模式有着极大的差异。,But the forms taken by this regionalism are radically different from the integrationist model of the EU.
4311,实际上，目前世界其他地方大部分反对将欧盟模式作为某种直接效仿的对象。,"Indeed, to date the rest of the world has largely rejected the EU model as something to emulate directly."
4312,然而，赫鲁晓夫在苏共二十大上对斯大林的批判在共产主义阵营中激起了骚动，并在苏联的东欧卫星国中激起了反抗。,"Nevertheless, Khrushchev’s revelations about Stalin at the Twentieth Congress caused turmoil in Communist ranks everywhere and encouraged a spirit of rebellion in Soviet satellite countries in Eastern Europe."
4312,1956年匈牙利爆发了反苏起义，苏联军队迅速镇压了这次起义。赫鲁晓夫和其他苏联领导人由于担心会进一步削弱苏联政权的根基，于是对去斯大林化运动进行低调处理。,"Soviet troops reacted by crushing an uprising in Hungary in 1956, and Khrushchev and the Soviet leaders, fearful of further undermining the basic foundations of the regime, downplayed their campaign of destalinization."
4313,全球变暖带来的结果是很难测量的。,The consequences of global warming are phenomenally complex to calibrate.
4313,首先，这是因为全球平均气温的增加真正带来地方的气温和气候变化的方式是不断改变的。,In the first place this is because the way in which an average increase in ambient global temperatures is actually translated into local temperature and climate change is very variable.
4313,而且，气候不仅仅包括气温，不断变化的气温与风、降雨和气压等的相互作用不可能以非常准确的方式来预测；第二，其他生态系统对全球变暖作出的反应也不甚清楚。,"Moreover, climate is more than just temperature, and the interaction of changing temperatures with winds, rainfall and pressure is impossible to predict in any very accurate way.Second, the response of other ecological systems to global warming is unclear."
4314,早期，领土与主权之间的联系不太紧密，像我们所说的那样，核心—边缘、都市—殖民地是描绘政治控制的有用模式。,"In earlier eras when territory and sovereignty were less closely linked, core and periphery, metropole and colony were, as we have noted, useful models for describing political space."
4314,在这种情况下，许多区域间和全球流动虽然改变着并扩大着这些领域，但是不一定跨越了国界。,"As such, many interregional and global flows transformed and extended those areas rather than necessarily crossing boundaries."
4314,而今天全球流动和相互联系达到了前所未有的程度，跨越了几乎完全由民族国家组成的世界。,"Today, historically unprecedented levels of global flows and interconnections cross a world that is almost universally made up of nation-states."
4314,几乎覆盖世界的民族国家与几乎涉及所有领域的全球化同时并存。,The near universality of the nation-state is paralleled by the extensity of globalization in nearly all domains.
4314,作为全球共同财产的环境，其恶化程度虽然在各地不同，但是波及到这个星球的所有角落。,"Environmental degradation of the global commons reaches, albeit unevenly, into every corner of the planet."
4315,随着布雷顿森林体系的解体，美国在这个领域中的主导地位再次让位给更加多极的世界。,"With the collapse of Bretton Woods, the dominance of the USA in this sphere has again given way to a more multipolar world."
4315,在过去20年中，尽管不断出现经济动荡，东亚和拉丁美洲的工业化以及全球自由贸易网络的建立已经开始重新安排全球经济网络中的力量结构。,"In the last two decades, the industrialization of East Asia and Latin America, and the creation of global free trade networks have looked set - despite periods of economic turmoil - to rearrange the structure of power within global economic networks once again."
4315,而且，旧的南北关系已经让位给更复杂的全球经济和生产力量关系的立体结构——一种新的全球劳动分工（参见第3~5章）。,"Moreover, the old North-South hierarchy has given way to a more complex geometry of global economic and productive power relations - a new global division of labour (see chapters 3 to 5)."
4316,从年代的角度来说，现代早期和现代整个时期的全球迁移总量在不断增加。,In terms of chronology the magnitude of total global migrations grew over the early modern and modern periods.
4316,早期欧洲向美洲的移民数量很少，向拉美和加勒比海地区的移民数量也很少。,"Early European migrations to the Americas were small, as were those to Latin America and the Caribbean."
4316,18世纪和19世纪的奴隶贸易的纯数量当然比前两个世纪的迁移量更大。,The slave trade of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was certainly larger in terms of sheer numbers than the flows of the two prior centuries.
4316,然而，现代整个时期全球迁移的高峰年代肯定是在19世纪晚期和20世纪早期。,"However, the peak years for global migration during the modern period must be the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries."
4317,90年代后期，跨国公司的活动和全球生产网络遍布世界各地。,In the late 1990s few economies were outside the reach of MNC activity and global production networks.
4317,如表5-3所示，在不同程度上，全球所有地区都是跨国公司或其外国分支机构的母国和东道国。,"As table 5.3 indicates, all regions of the globe, to a greater or lesser extent, are both the home of and host to MNCs or their foreign affiliates."
4317,但最引人注目的是发展中国国家内部以及来自发展中国家的跨国公司的规模。,"But what is striking is the scale of MNC activity within, and from, the developing countries."
4318,“全球政治”的概念对传统的国内/国际，内部/外部，领土/非领土政治之间的区分提出了挑战，而这些区分的基础是传统的“政治”概念（参见Walker，1993）。此外，“全球政治”还集中反映了国家间联系的丰富性和复杂性，这种联系在全球秩序中已经超越了国家和社会。,"The idea of 'global politics' challenges the traditional distinctions between domestic/international, inside/outside, territorial/non-territorial politics, as embedded in conventional conceptions of 'the political' (see Walker, 1993).It also highlights the richness and complexity of the interconnections which transcend states and societies in the global order."
4318,尽管政府和国家仍然理所当然地是强有力的行动者，但是，它们现在必须和一大群其他的机构和组织共享全球竞技舞台。,"Although governments and states remain, of course, powerful actors, they now share the global arena with an array of other agencies and organizations."
4319,国际规制体制标志着全球政治的日益制度化（Young，1989， 第11页）。,"International regimes mark out the growing institutionalization of global politics (Young, 1989, p. 11)."
4319,它们构成了全球治理的形式，明显区别于传统的政府的概念，后者是在特定区域内最高的政治权力的基础上构想的。,"They constitute forms of global governance, distinct from traditional notions of government conceived in terms of the specific sites of sovereign political power."
4319,当然，在当代国际体系中，并不存在超越于国家权力之上的单个的政治权威。,"In the contemporary international system there is, of course, no single political authority above the state."
4319,尽管如此，国际规制体制的发展仍然非常迅猛，反映了全球和地区性卷入类型的强化。,"But despite this, international regulatory regimes have developed rapidly, reflecting the intensification of patterns of global and regional enmeshment."
4320,实际上，无套裤汉的革命热情本身并没有随着罗伯斯庇尔的被处决而有所削弱。,Actually the revolutionary elan of the sansculottes did not dissipate itself with Robespierre’s execution.
4320,在“热月政变”和经济控制放松以后，巴黎贫民的物质条件仍然趋于恶化。,"After Thermidor and the dismounting of the remaining economic controls, the material situation of the Parisian poor, if anything, deteriorated still further."
4320,面对这种局面，他们在1795年春天举行了暴动。这次行动也许比先前的（即1789年7月14日、1792年8月10日和1793年5月31日）那些伟大革命行动更为激烈。,"They responded with riots in the spring of 1795, perhaps even more violent than the great revolutionary days of July I4, 1789, August 10, 1792, and May 31, 1793."
4321,与此相伴的是国际新规范在关于国际社会干预国家事务权利方面的新发展，这些权利针对已破坏或正在破坏人道主义的国家。（参看本书1.3.3部分） （参看本书1.,Associated with this expansion is the development of new international norms concerning the right of the international community to intervene in the sovereign  affairs of states where crimes against humanity are believed to have occurred or to be occurring (see section 1.
4321,3.3部分）。,3.3 above).
4321,从这个意义上讲，联合国的预防战争和冲突的角色变得越来越突出，即使它经常未能取得积极成效。,"In this sense, the war and conflict prevention role of the UN has acquired increasing global salience even if the UN has often failed to achieve positive results."
4322,行政权力的执掌者和政府官僚们经常同时获得经验和财富，这种情况促进了他们在面对地方组织和共同体时的自主性。,"Executive powers and state bureaucracies frequently gained both in experience and assets, and this enhanced their autonomy in the face of local assemblies and groups."
4322,那些拥有良好的行政管理基础，能够号召广大的人民，有着广泛的税收基础，并拥有强大的军队和造船工业的国家获得了优势地位。,"Those states which were able to call on a sound administrative infrastructure, a substantial population and a wide tax base, alongside arms and ship-building industries, gained an advantage."
4322,在17和18世纪，这种优势由绝对主义政府和立宪政府所享有；而到了19世纪，这种优势则由新出现的现代民族国家所享有。,This advantage was enjoyed by absolutist and constitutional governments in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries; in the nineteenth century it was enjoyed by the emergent modern nation-states.
4323,然而，不管民族主义存在何种多样性以及它们与国家之间的关系通常是如何的模糊，民主理论想当然地把人民大众、市民、选举机制、赞同的本质以及民族国家之间的疆界联系在一起，尤其是当它在19世纪和20世纪获得了进一步发展后，情况就更是如此。,"Nonetheless, despite the diversity of nationalisms and their frequently ambiguous relationships to states, the theory of democracy took for granted, particularly as it developed in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the link between the demos, citizenship, electoral mechanisms, the nature of consent, and the boundaries of the nation-state."
4323,尽管不同的政治共同体的命运可能会遭到冲击和扭曲，但是，决定“国家命运”的基础的最合适的场所还是建立在一定领土基础上的政治共同体本身。,"The fates of different political communities may be contested and intertwined, but the appropriate place for determining the foundation of 'national fate' was the territorially based, political community itself."
4323,在当今世界，自由民主的关键原则和实践仍然几乎只与主权民族国家的原则和制度有关。,In the contemporary world the key principles and practices of liberal democracy remain associated almost exclusively with the principles and institutions of the sovereign nation-state.
4324,国际法和人权体制的变革虽然冲击着国家主权，但是至少在实施的一致性上还没有影响到所有国家的自主性。,"Transformations in international law and human rights regimes impinge on the sovereignty of states but not yet, at least in terms of consistency of application, on the autonomy of all states."
4324,虽然合法统治权在一定程度上被改变了，但是国家的实际自主性可能还没有受到根本影响，当然原因在于执行机制出现了弱点。,"The de jure entitlement to rule may to an extent be transformed, but the de facto autonomy of the state may not yet be radically affected, due, of course, to weaknesses in enforcement mechanisms."
4324,一个形象的例子是金融全球化及其对宏观经济政策的影响，因为它不仅对主权本身而且对自主性产生了根本性的影响。,A contrasting case can be developed by reflecting on financial globalization and its impact on macroeconomic policy.For this is an example of the radical impact of globalization not on sovereignty per se but on autonomy.
4325,人身赎金意思是“人的身价”，即人的金钱价值。,"Wergeld, which means ""man money,"" was the value of a person in monetary terms."
4325,这个价值因社会地位的差别而迥异。,That value varied considerably according to social status.
4325,例如，因侵犯贵族而受罚的金额要远远高于因侵犯自由人或者奴隶受罚的数额。,"An offense against a nobleman, for example, cost considerably more than one against a freeman or a slave."
4326,在15世纪前半期的人文主义中，另一个明显的趋势是对古希腊文明的兴趣的日益增长。,Also evident in the humanism of the first half of the fifteenth century was a growing interest in classical Greek civilization.
4326,布鲁尼是第一批全面掌握希腊知识的学者之一。,Bruni was one of the first Italian humanists to gain a thorough knowledge of Greek.
4326,他是拜占庭学者曼纽尔克里梭罗拉的狂热门徒，克里梭罗拉曾在1396—1400年间执教于佛罗伦萨。,"He became an enthusiastic pupil of the Byzantine scholar Manuel Chrysoloras, who taught in Florence from 1396 to 1400."
4326,人文主义者如饥似渴地研读若柏拉图以及古希腊的诗人的作品。戏剧家、历史学家和演讲家的作品，如修昔底德、欧里庇得斯和索福克勒斯的作品在中世纪盛期都完全被经院哲学家忽略了。,"Humanists eagerly perused the works of Plato as well as Greek poets, dramatists, historians, and orators, such as Thucydides, Euripides, and Sophocles, all of whom had been neglected by the scholastics of the High Middle Ages."
4327,荒谬的是，虽然基督教和犹太教的教徒遍布世界的大部分角落，但在每一块大陆或每一个地区，没有一种传统的世界宗教——基督教、伊斯兰教、儒教、印度教和佛教-—拥有绝对多数的信徒。,"Paradoxically, none of the conventional list of world religions - Christianity, Islam, Confucianism, Hinduism, Judaism and Buddhism - is present in significant numbers in every continent or region, though Christianity and Judaism have spread their adherents to most corners of the globe."
4327,印度教、佛教和儒教都在它们的所在地区有牢固的堡垒——南亚、东业和中国。,"Hinduism, Buddhism and Confucianism are all more tightly concentrated in their regional strongholds - South Asia, East Asia and China."
4327,伊斯教占据中间位置，在东非和北非中部非常强大，在非洲其他地方和东亚也有大量信徒。,"Islam occupies a middling position, strong in the Middle East and North Africa with significant numbers in the rest of Africa and East Asia."
4328,在平息了萨摩藩的叛乱后，明治政府完全掌握了政权。,"After quelling the Satsuma Rebellion, the Meiji government was firmly in the saddle."
4328,在将近9年的时间里，它力图革除封建机构并代之以许多现代社会的基本体制。,In the space of nine years it had managed to dismantle the feudal apparatus and replace it with much of the basic framework of modern society.
4328,这实际上是一次自上而下的革命，比较起18世纪法国的左翼革命和20世纪俄国与中国的革命，日本革命的完成相对来说较少地使用暴力。,This was indeed a revolution from above and accomplished with a relatively small amount of violence in comparison with the leftist revolutions of France in the eighteenth century or of Russia and China in the twentieth.
4329,大西洋地区的三角贸易经济。,Triangular Trade in the Atlantic Economy.
4329,随着奴隶贸易的增长，它成为作为大西洋贸易特征的三角贸易路线的一部分。三角贸易就是欧洲西海岸、非洲海岸的奴隶供应站和南北美洲港口三者之间的货物与黑奴交换。,"As the trade in slaves grew, it became a part of the triangular trade route that characterized the Atlantic economy, involving the exchange of goods and slaves between the western coast of Europe, the slave depots on the African coast, and the ports of North and South America."
4330,例如，历史上西方人对汽车所具有的根深蒂固的偏好以及他们对能源毫无节制的使用，使得大量的导致温室效应的气体释放进入大气中，并大大促进了全球气温的升高。,"For example, the historically and structurally ingrained Western predilection for the motor car and profligate energy use entails a very large release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and makes a significant contribution to global warming."
4330,在西方人的驾驶习惯、西方的交通和能源政策与孟加拉或撒哈拉以南非洲不断变化的农业命运及其国内政治之间建立一条复杂而又合理的因果链，这并不困难，有关海洋防御的公共开支和防止沙漠化的决策是与别的地方作出的有关修建道路和能源效率的决策相关联的，而且取决于这些决策。,"It is not difficult to establish a complex but plausible chain of causation between Western driving habits, Western transport and energy policies and the changing agricultural fortunes of Bangladesh or sub-Saharan Africa and their internal politics.Decisions on public expenditure on sea defences and desertification measures are tied to, and dependent on, decisions made elsewhere about roadbuilding and energy efficiency."
4330,政治实际上是“扩展”的，而不同社会是相互交织在一起的，不同的政治体和社会是相互依夺地联系在一起的。,
4331,另一位历史学家风趣地提到印刷术的传播或许增加了官僚阶层的容量。,Another historian makes the interesting suggestion that the diffusion of printing may have increased the absorptive capacities of the mandarinate.
4331,印刷术使得一些小商人获得了丰富的文化知识从而有可能踏上仕途使谋得宫职成为可能。,Printing made it possible for some of the smaller merchants to acquire sufficient literary culture to obtain an official post.
4331,虽然为参加考试而付出昂贵的代价仍是一个很重要的障碍，但得到一官半职毕竟容易多了。,"Though the expense of taking the examinations remained an important barrier, access to official posts became somewhat easier."
4331,他提出了一些证据以证明帝国行政系统的诱人之处。,He presents some striking evidence of the attractiveness of the Imperial service.
4331,某些商人甚至不惜自我阄割成为宦官，以享有靠近皇帝的位置。,A number of these merchants castrated themselves in order to become eunuchs and enjoy a position close to the throne.
4331,而且这些阉人还因其受过教育而占优势，因为普通的宦官是禁止学习文化的，宦官的主要对手是朝廷中的士大夫。,"Those who castrated themselves enjoyed a special advantage, since they already had the education ordinary eunuchs (the main competitors of the scholar-officials at court) were forbidden to seek."
4332,宣言宣称，国家“应该保护少数群体的存在及其民族、文化、宗教和语言身份”。宣言指出，少数群体的成员应有能够“有效地参与文化、宗教、社会和公共生活”的权利。,"Proclaiming that states ""shall protect the existence and national, cultural, religious and linguistic identity of minorities"", the Declaration sets out rights for members of minorities to be able ""to participate effectively in cultural, religious, social and public life""."
4332,尽管宣言还不具有合法的约束力，但它已被广泛地看作正在创立一种国际法的未来的发展轨道。,"While the Declaration is not yet legally binding, it is widely regarded as establishing a future trajectory of international law."
4332,在其他的背景下，寻求对少数群体的权利的保护的推动也特别值得一提。,"In other contexts, the impetus to secure protection for minority rights is particularly noteworthy."
4333,接连几位民主党总统的执政支持了美国政治中的新政传统——1948年的哈里·杜鲁门总统，1960年的约翰·肯尼迪总统以及1964年的林登·约翰逊总统。,"The New Deal tradition in American politics was bolstered by the election of Democratic presidents---Harry Truman in 1948, John Kennedy in 1960, and Lyndon Johnson in 1964."
4333,即使是1952年和1956年当选为总统的共和党人德怀特·艾森豪威尔也没有改变新政的基本方向。,"Even the election of a Republican president, Dwight Eisenhower, in 1952 and 1956 did not change the basic direction of the New Deal."
4333,正如艾森豪威尔所说：“假如任何政党尝试着要取消社会保险和劳工法令，取消农场计划，那么你将不会再在我们的政治生活中看到它。”,"As Eisenhower stated, ""Should any political party attempt to abolish Social Security and eliminate labor laws and farm programs, you would not hear of that party again in our political history."""
4334,同样，帝国主义也被与社会达尔文主义及种族主义联系了起来，社会达尔文主义者相信，在民族的竞争中，适者将会是胜者，能够生存下来。,"It was also tied to social Darwinism and racism.Social Darwinists believed that in the struggle between nations, the fit are victorious and survive."
4334,优等种族必须通过军事力量统治劣等种族，以显示他们是多么地强大和有男子汉气概。,Superior races must dominate inferior races by military force to show how strong and virile they are.
4334,一位英国人写道：“黑种人和黄种人一定会永远低于白种人的发展，随着白种人发展得越来越高级，另两个人种也将越发萎缩，不似人类而越发接近动物。”,"As one Englishman wrote, ""To the development of the White Man, the Black Man and the Yellow must ever remain inferior, and as the former raised itself hiA Global History: from Prehistory to the 21st Centuryer and yet hiA Global History: from Prehistory to the 21st Centuryer, so did these latter seem to shrink out of humanity and appear nearer and nearer to the brutes."""
4335,社会主义，尤其是它的马克思主义变体，都深深植根于欧洲19世纪资本主义工业化和城市化过程中—形成于哲学反思和实践斗争中。,"Socialism, and particularly its Marxist variant, has its roots in the experience of European nineteenth---century capitalist industrialization and urbanization --- forged from both philosophical reflection and practical struggle."
4335,然而，社会主义的思想和语言很快就传播到了世界经济更加落后的地区，最后传播到了几乎没有经历这些变迁的社会。,Yet the ideas and language of socialism swiftly spread to more backward regions of the world economy and ultimately to societies almost untouched by those changes.
4335,这并不能够说明，那些思想在向东和向南传播的过程中不会发生深刻的变化。,That is not to suggest that those ideas did not undergo a profound transformation in their passage east and south.
4336,俾斯麦的社会保障体系是当时世界上从未见过的最先进 的。,Bismarck’s social security system was the most progressive the world had yet seen.
4336,然而，镇压和社会福利立法都未能阻止社会主义的发展。,"Nevertheless, both the repressive and the social welfare measures failed to stop the growth of socialism."
4336,面对着挫败，俾斯麦在1890年计划采取更多的反社会主义措施，但未等他实行之前，威廉二世（1888-1918)因急于推行自己的政策，就让这位年迈的首相告老还乡了。,"In his frustration, Bismarck planned still more antisocialist measures in 1890, but before he could carry them out, the new emperor, William II (1888--1918), eager to pursue his own policies, cashiered the aged chancellor."
4337,网格表C-3总结了全球化在所有关键领域中的影响——它们的一般趋势或模式。,A summary of these impacts --- their general tendencies or patterns --- in relation to all the key domains of globalization is displayed in grid C.
4337,在决策影响方面，显然全球化在许多领域已经改变了政策选择的成本和收益、政策工具以及本土、国家、区域和全球政策选择之间的平等关系。,"3. In respect of decisional impacts it is clear that globalization in many domains has altered the costs and benefits of policy choices, policy instruments and the balance between local, national, regional and global policy options."
4337,在经济和生态领域这一点特别明显，宏观经济政策或者环境保护方面的某些选择有可能代价更大（无论是社会意义上还是金钱意义上），而其他选择更有吸引力。,This is particularly evident in the economic and ecological domains where certain policy choices in respect of macroeconomic policy or environmental protection tend to become more costly (in a social as well as a monetary sense) while others become more attractive.
4338,尽管中国大熊猫数量的下降及其生活环境的退化没有对地方上或国际上以及经济上或身体上的福利和舒适带来任何直接后果，但是，它们都可以归结为环境的退化。,"The decline in the numbers of Chinese pandas and their habitat, although of no immediate consequence to either local or international, economic or bodily well-being, can be classed as environmental degradation."
4338,因为大熊猫的减少与保存共同的环境遗产的利益相冲突，而且与承认非人类的但具有感情的生命的生存权利相矛盾。,For the loss of the panda comes into conflict with an interest in the preservation of a common environmental heritage and a recognition of a right to existence for non-human but sentient beings.
4338,类似地，灌木篱墙的减少及其微生态系统的衰退很少对英国农村的经济生存能力带来良接后果，但是，它却在审美、生态和象征上具有重大意义。,"Similarly, the decline of hedgerows and the micro-ecosystems they contain is of little direct consequence to the economic viability of the English countryside but is of enormous aesthetic, ecological and symbolic import."
4339,热带雨林的消失影响着全世界的气候（因为热带雨林吸收一氧化碳并通过光合作用制造氧气）。并且也造成了大量的已知的和未知的动植物物种的灭绝。,Rainforest loss affects the world's climate (since rainforests are absorbers of carbon dioxide and producers of oxygen through photosynthesis) and it also effectively extinguishes a huge number of known and unknown plant and animal species.
4339,与此同时，人们越来越感受到地球上生物多样性正在不断减少，人们发起了保护面临威胁的大哺乳动物——熊猫、大象、鲸鱼和老虎等——的运动。,"This loss has been accompanied by a more general sense of the diminishing biodiversity of the planet, led by the most obvious and emotive campaigns for the preservation of threatened large mammals --- pandas, elephants, whales and big cats."
4340,路德仅仅保留了天主教会七项圣礼中的两项：浸洗礼和圣餐礼。,Luther kept only two of the Catholic church’s seven sacraments: baptism and the Lord’s Supper.
4340,浸洗礼意味着依靠上帝的恩典获得重生。,Baptism signified rebirth through grace.
4340,路德根据圣餐礼否定了天主教的圣餐变体论，根据这种观点，圣餐礼上消费掉的面包和葡萄酒会奇迹般地转换成耶稣的血肉。,"Regarding the Lord’s Supper or the Eucharist, Luther denied the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation, which taught that the substance of the bread and wine consumed in the rite is miraculously transformed into the body and blood of Jesus."
4340,然而他继续坚持认为，面包和葡萄酒中的耶稣血肉是真实存在的，它是上帝对原罪宽恕的证明。,Yet he continued to insist on the real presence of Jesus’ body and blood in the bread and wine given as a testament to God’s forgiveness of sin.
4341,天主教的圣事让教会成为人们生活——从出生到死亡——不可或缺的一部分。,"The sacraments of the Catholic church ensured that the church was an integral part of people’s lives, from birth to death."
4341,有七种圣事（现在也是如此）是神职人员所专署的，诸如洗礼和圣餐礼（主的晚餐）这些圣事，是内在恩典（恩典是上帝给予的让人们获救的恩赐）的外在象征，也是基督教救世所必须的。,"There were (and still are) seven sacraments, administered only by the clergy.Sacraments, such as baptism and the Eucharist (the Lord’s Supper), were viewed as outward symbols of an inward grace (grace was God’s freely given gift that enabled humans to be saved) and were considered imperative for a Christian’s salvation."
4341,因此神职人员被认为是获得拯救的关键人物。,"Therefore, the clergy were seen to have a key role in the attainment of salvation."
4342,与重视圣徒作用关联密切的是圣物，对圣物的利用在中世纪盛期也显著增多。,"Emphasis on the role of the saints was closely tied to the use of relics, which also increased noticeably in the High Middle Ages."
4342,圣物通常是信徒认为值得膜拜的圣徒遗骨或是贴身物品。,Relics were usually the bones of saints or objects intimately connected to saints that were considered worthy of veneration by the faithful.
4342,一位12世纪的修士对修道院圣物是这样描述的：“那里放的是比黄金更珍贵的东西……圣徒奥斯瓦尔德的右臂……这是我们亲眼看到过、亲吻过且亲手抚摸过的圣物……这里放的是他一部分肋骨和他去世时身下的土壤。”,"A twelfth century English monk began his description of the abbey’s relics by saying, ‘‘There is kept there a thing more precious than gold,...the right arm of St. Oswald....This we have seen with our own eyes and have kissed, and have handled with our own hands....There are kept here also part of his ribs and of the soil on which he fell.’’"
4343,"在19世纪晚期，克虏伯的出口量达到其所有武器产量的86.4%，而在第一次世界大战以前，施奈德的出口比例达50%，维克斯的出口比例达33%（McNeill, 1982, 第302页）。","In the late nineteenth century, Krupps exported 86.4 per cent of its arms output, while prior to the First World War Schneider was exporting 50 per cent and Vickers 33 per cent (McNeill, 1982, p. 302)."
4343,由于国内防务市场变得越来越饱和，导致军事工业超量、出口的动力变得更加强烈。,"As domestic defence markets became increasingly saturated, resulting in militaryindustrial overcapacity, the drive for exports became even more intense."
4343,另外，政府也允许大量的不受管制的武器贸易。,"Moreover, governments sanctioned a largely unregulated trade in arms."
4344,有个时期，人们曾认为，这些十字军东侵实际上对促进中世纪后期的各项富有建设性的发展，其中包括贸易、城市和文化的发展，起到了决定性的作用。,"These Crusades were considered at one time to have been responsible for starting virtually every constructive development in the later Middle Ages, including the growth of trade and towns and the advances in culture."
4344,现在，这种说法已不再为人们所接受。,This interpretation is no longer accepted.
4344,相反，人们普遍认为，十字军东侵基本上是这些发展的结果而不是原因。,Instead it is generally agreed that the Crusades were the consequence rather than the cause of this progress.
4345,当然，文化互动和文化相似性的程度将不断变化。,"Of course, the degree of interaction and cultural similarity will vary."
4345,因此，除了文化关系的延伸，我们还可以谈论文化关系的深化，一个地方的变化、争论和革新更可能在另一个地方被改变或被反对。,"Thus, alongside stretching, we can also talk of the deepening of cultural relationships where changes, debates and innovations in one place are more likely to be transferred to (or rejected in) another."
4345,将时间上和空间上本来分离的地方与人结合在一起吋以被看作是种时空压缩形式。,This bringing together of places and people separated in time and space can also be viewed as a form of time-space compression.
4346,1871年之后，城市工人的物质境况的确有所改善。,Urban workers did experience a real betterment in the material conditions of their lives after 1871.
4346,单就城市的发展而言，就意味着居住条件的改善。,"For one thing, urban improvements meant better living conditions."
4346,实际工资上涨，与之并行的许多消费品价格的下跌，尤其是在19世纪80、90年代，使得工人们能够消费得起食物和除住房以外的东西了。,"A rise in real wages, accompanied by a decline in many consumer costs, especially in the 1880s and 1890s, made it possible for workers to afford more than just food and housing."
4346,工人们的预算中现在也包括了更多的衣服开销，而随着罢工和劳工运动的斗争，工作时间缩短到每天十小时，并且星期六下午也成为休息时间，工人们甚至可以去进行休闲消费了。,Workers’ budgets now provided money for more clothes and even leisure at the same time that strikes and labor agitation were providing shorter (ten-hour) workdays and Saturday afternoons off.
4347,贸易“强度”是全球贸易活动重要性的一个标尺。,The intensity of trade is a measure of the magnitude of global trading activity.
4347,我们可以借助世界贸易与世界产出的比率来估计，即使这种全球估计是粗线条的。,"It can be estimated by the ratio of world trade to world output, although global estimates of this are very crude."
4347,国家贸易依存度（贸易额占国内生产总值的比例）标准会更精确些，而且，在这项研究中通过对6个国家的长期估计，我们可以提供贸易规模变化的详细的历史过程。,"National trade to GDP measures are more accurate, and long-run estimates for the six countries in this study offer a detailed historical picture of the changing magnitude of trade."
4348,标准贸易理论作出了许多假设。,
4348,,The standard economic theory of trade makes a number of assumptions.
4348,一旦一国开放贸易，其贸易品的价格就被认为反映世界价格（根据汇率调整）而不是国内价格。,"Once a country opens up to trade, the prices of its tradable goods are assumed to reflect world prices (adjusted for the exchange rate) rather than domestic prices."
4348,世界价格体现了在全球市场上而不是在国内经济中生产贸易品的相对成本。,World prices reflect the relative costs of producing tradable goods in the global market rather than in the national economy.
4349,随着关税降至最小程度，贸易性质的变化，关贸总协定的框架已不足以应付局面。所以世界贸易组织诞生了（Hoekman and Kostecki，1995)。,"With the reduction of tariffs to minimal levels and the changing nature of trade, the skeleton framework of the GATT was insufficient, hence the creation of the World Trade Organization (Hoekman and Kostecki, 1995)."
4349,因为贸易壁垒已经消除，人们的兴趣转向了不同国家中控制竞争的国内管制和法律的差异上去。,"As formal barriers to trade have been eliminated, interest has shifted towards differences in the domestic regulations and laws governing competition in different countries."
4349,因为国内政策可被看作是给予本国公司相对于其他公司的竞争优势，所以，它们也可被说成是潜在的贸易壁垒。,Since domestic regulations can be seen to give competitive advantage to firms from one country over another they can be construed as potential barriers to trade.
4350,第二，已经有人反对国际法主要是针对政治和地缘政治事务这一信条。,"Second, opinion has moved against the doctrine that international law is primarily about political and geopolitical affairs."
4350,根据这一新的概念，国际法越来越关注于协调和规制经济、社会、通信以及环境事务。,"According to this new conception, international law is concerned increasingly with coordinating and regulating economic, social, communication and environmental matters."
4350,国际政治中的行动者和机构——例如，联合国本身、世界银行、国际电信联盟、联合国粮食及农业组织，以及世界卫生组织——的数目的不断膨胀，与之相关，扩大国际法范畴的压力也在不断增加。,"Linked to the substantial expansion in the number of actors and agencies in world politics --- for example, the United Nations itself, the World Bank, the International Telecommunication Union, the Food and Agricultural Organization and the World Health Organization --- there have been many pressures to increase the scope of international law."
4351,第二，已经有人反对国际法主要是针对政治和地缘政治事务这一信条。,"Second, opinion has moved against the doctrine that international law is primarily about political and geopolitical affairs."
4351,根据这一新的概念，国际法越来越关注于协调和规制经济、社会、通信以及环境事务。,"According to this new conception, international law is concerned increasingly with coordinating and regulating economic, social, communication and environmental matters."
4351,国际政治中的行动者和机构——例如，联合国本身、世界银行、国际电信联盟、联合国粮食及农业组织，以及世界卫生组织——的数目的不断膨胀，与之相关，扩大国际法范畴的压力也在不断增加。,"Linked to the substantial expansion in the number of actors and agencies in world politics --- for example, the United Nations itself, the World Bank, the International Telecommunication Union, the Food and Agricultural Organization and the World Health Organization --- there have been many pressures to increase the scope of international law."
4352,最后，好莱坞、微软和AT&T仍然在经营上有利可图——没有建立可替代的政治认同和合法性中心。,"In the end, Hollywood, Microsoft and AT&T are in the business of making money --- not founding alternative centres of political identity and legitimacy."
4352,然而，巨大信息流和人口流在全球范围内循环流动，而且在跨越国界时不受任何惩罚，己经改变了各种民族事业发展所必需的环境。,"Yet the huge flows of information, people and imagery that circulate around the globe, crossing borders with impunity, have changed the context in which national projects of any kind must develop."
4352,各种民族主义事业所受到的真正威胁也许更可能来自最初的文化世界主义，这种文化世界主义对作为主要的政治和文化共冋体的民族国家观念形成挑战，并要求对组织中的权力而不是民族国家的权力进行重新定位（参看第1章）。,The real threat to nationalist projects of all kinds is perhaps more likely to come from an incipient cultural cosmopolitanism that would challenge the idea of the nation as the primary political and cultural community and demand the relocation of power in institutions other than the national state (see chapter 1).
4353,随着科学信仰的胜利，宗教信仰就不可避免地要受到损害，这将在欧洲的知识分子中催发日益增长的世俗化。,"As the scientific beliefs triumphed, it became almost inevitable that religious beliefs would suffer, leading to a growing secularization in European intellectual life."
4353,很多17世纪的知识分子都既信仰宗教又相信科学，他们相信这两者分裂的后果将是悲剧性的。,Many seventeenth-century intellectuals were both religious and scientific and believed that the implications of this split would be tragic.
4353,一些人认为这种分裂是不必要的，另一些人则认为有必要将上帝、人类与机械论的宇宙整合进新的哲学综合体之中。,"Some believed that the split was largely unnecessary, while others felt the need to combine God, humans, and a mechanistic universe into a new philosophical synthesis."
4354,个人只有“通过参与城邦生活才能在学术上和道徳上逐渐成熟”。,"An individual only ""grows to maturity---both intellectually and morally---through participation"" in the life of the state."
4354,市民人文主义反映了意大利文艺复兴时期城市生活的价值观念。,Civic humanism reflected the values of the urban society of the Italian Renaissance.
4354,人文主义者开始相信他们关于人文主义的研究应当服务于城邦。,Humanists came to believe that their study of the humanities should be put to the service of the state.
4354,人文主义者担任城邦的大臣、议员和顾问这种现象不是偶然的。,"It is no accident that humanists served the state as chancellors, councillors, and advisers."
4355,改1：加洛林时期修道士在手抄室抄写的大量手稿对于保存古典遗产做出了重要贡献。,The production of manuscripts in Carolingian monastic scriptoria was a crucial factor in the preservation of the ancient legacy.
4355,残存下来的加洛林王朝时期的手稿大约有8000本之多。,About eight thousand manuscripts survive from Carolingian times.
4355,事实上，现存的大约90%的古典罗马作品都是靠加洛林时期的修道士们抄写保存下来的。,Virtually 90 percent of the ancient Roman works that we have today exist because they were copied by Carolingian monks.
4356,最基本的原因是农村劳动力持续短缺。,The fundamental cause was an increasing shortage of rural labor.
4356,乡村中贸易和工业的生长意味着大的土地所有者不得不把更多的土地分给依从他的小土地所有者，以便抗拒城镇对小土地所有者的吸引力。,The growth of rural trade and industry meant that the possessors of large holdings had to give more land to their dependent small holders in order to hold them against the pull of the towns.
4356,而小的土地所有者也越来越发现靠手工业品能够赚钱。,
4356,,"Too, the small holders (nago) were finding more and more opportunities to make money in handicrafts."
4357,格里高利七世在1073年当选教皇。他深信，是上帝选定了他，指定由他改革教会。,"Elected pope in 1073, Gregory was convinced that he had been chosen by God to reform the church."
4357,为了达到这些目标，格里高利宣称，他作为教皇是上帝的“世间代牧”，教皇的权威应当覆盖整个基督教世界，包括统治者。,"In pursuit of those aims, Gregory claimed that he, as pope, was God’s “vicar on earth” and that the pope’s authority extended over all Christians, including rulers."
4357,格里高利废除了授衣礼，只有教会才有授衣权，这意味着格里高利七世有权任命教会自己的教士，管理教会自己的事务。,"Gregory sought the elimination of lay investiture.Only then could the church regain its freedom, by which Gregory meant the right to appoint its own clergy and run its own affairs."
4358,在路线的起点和终点，更多的地方网络将欧洲的外围地区、日本和朝鲜与丝绸之路联系起来。,"At either end of the route more local networks connected up the peripheral regions of Europe, Japan and Korea to the Silk Route."
4358,这种贸易主要是贵重金属和奢侈品贸易，它将继续繁荣直至罗马帝国和汉王朝的衰落。,"This trade was overwhelmingly in precious metals and luxury goods, and prospered until the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the Han empire."
4358,贸易在公元1000年前的4个世纪里重新崛起，在公元1000年到1350年间达到鼎盛时期。,Trade was rekindled in the four centuries leading up to AD 1000 and blossomed between AD 1000 and 1350.
4358,像邓(Deng)指出的，“中国长距离的土特产贸易显示了一种国际贸易系统……实际上……在前现代的亚洲存在着以中国为中心的贸易系统”（1997年）。,"As Deng concludes, 'China's long-distance staple trade reveals a system of international exchange... in fact... the existence of a Chinacentred trading system in pre-modern Asia' (1997)."
4359,"集体安全起源于“四国联盟”（1815〜1970年），它通过一套制度化的列强会议体系，在19世纪的大多数时间里维护了欧洲内部的相对和平与安全（I.Clark, 1989，第6页）。","The practice of collective security had its origins in the Concert of Europe (1815-70) which, through a system of institutionalized great power conferences, reinforced relative peace and security within Europe for much of the nineteenth century (I. Clark, 1989, ch. 6)."
4359,“四国联盟”体系可以被描述成一个国际安全制度。,The Concert system could be described as an international security regime.
4359,赞里诺（Zelikow) 认为，后冷战时代的欧洲安全模式开始模仿一个新的“四国联盟”体系（1992)。,Zelikow argues that security arrangements in post-Cold War Europe are beginning to resemble a new Concert system (1992).
4360,苏联与美国之间的全球性对抗影响了世界政治近50年。,The global rivalry between the Soviet Union and the USA mediated world politics for almost five decades.
4360,在这段时间里，世界成为一个统一了的战争竞技场，在其中，为了意识形态和军事霸权所进行的斗争渗透到每一个地区。,During this time the world became a unified strategic arena in which the struggle for ideological and military supremacy permeated every geographical region.
4360,正如华尔兹（Waltz）指出的：“在一个两极世界里，没有边缘，只有两个能进行世界规模行动的大国，在任何地方发生的任何事情都可能与这二者相关”（1979，第171页）。,"As Waltz observed: 'in a bipolar world there are no peripheries. With only two powers capable of acting on a world scale, anything that happens anywhere is potentially of concern to both of them' (1979, p. 171)."
4361,因为戈尔巴乔夫在是赫鲁晓夫改革时代受的教育，他决心要把那些改革进行到底，达到原来预期的目的。,"Educated during the years of Khrushchev's reforms, Gorbachev seemed intent on taking those reforms to their logical conclusions."
4361,20世纪80年代，苏联经济问题已经凸现。,"By the 1980s, Soviet economic problems were obvious."
4361,僵硬的中央计划政策导致管理不善并窒息了活力。,"Rigid, centralized planning led to mismanagement and stifled innovation."
4361,苏联在太空探索方面仍然领先，但在高科技尤其是私人和公共用途的计算机生产方面落后于西方。,"Although the Soviets still excelled in space exploration, they fell behind the West in high technology, especially in the development and production of computers for private and public use."
4361,对苏联人来说最明显的就是生活水平的下降。,Most noticeable to the Soviet people was the decline in the standard of living.
4361,于是一开始，戈尔巴乔夫就宣扬要进行激进的改革。,"From the start, Gorbachev preached the need for radical reforms."
4362,贸易使所有产出部门的状况发生了革命性变化——今天，几乎没有一种产业仅仅依赖于国内市场或者国内生产部门和原材料。,Trade has revolutionized the prospects of all industrial sectors --- today few industries rely purely on domestic markets or domestically produced components and raw materials.
4362,举例来说，虽然建筑业基本上是使用国内原料，雇佣本土劳动力和满足国内需求，但主要设备可能是进口的。而且，随着建筑公司国际所有权的增加，配套服务也许通过贸易才能实现。,"For example, although the construction industry primarily uses domestic materials, employs local labour and satisfies domestic demand, capital equipment may be imported and, with increasing international ownership of construction firms, support services may also be traded."
4363,虽然众多神秘宗教竞相吸引罗马世界的注意，但最重要的或许当属密特拉教。,"Although many mystery cults competed for the attention of the Roman world, perhaps the most important was Mithraism."
4363,密特拉神是波斯的索罗亚斯德教里的至尊的光神亚胡拉·马兹达最早的信使（参见第2 章）。,"Mithras was the chief agent of Ahuramazda, the supreme god of light in Persian Zoroastrianism (see Chapter 2)."
4363,在罗马世界里，密特拉等同于太阳神，称为不可征服的太阳。,"In the Roman world, Mithras came to be identified with the sun god and was known by his Roman title, the Unconquered Sun."
4364,通过建立著名的厘金这样一种向行商坐贾征税的制度，帝国政府强化了分裂的趋势，这是太平军叛乱的产物。,"By establishing the famous likin, a tax collected from shopkeepers and travelling merchants, the Imperial government intensified disruptive trends."
4364,当传统的方法已不能征到足够的税赋时，厘金便作为提髙国库基金的新措施应运而生。,The tax was an emergency measure to raise funds needed as a result of the Taiping Rebellion that it could not collect through traditional methods.
4364,和对土地课以重税相比，某些中兴时期的政治家更喜欢征收厘金，这一点并不值得惊讶。,It is scarcely surprising that several Restoration leaders favored the likin in preference to a heavier tax on land.
4364,另一方面，税收又从帝国政府的控制下分离出来，转入地方。与此同时，乡绅利用征税权形成新的地方权威的经济基础，这是军阀时代的雏型。,"Control of the tax fell out of the hands of the Imperial government, while the tax itself remained to help provide an economic base for new regional authorities, prototypes of the warlord era."
4365,通过这些机制，重要的武器（如战斗机）由第一等级生产国扩散到第二等级生产国和第三等级生产国。,"Through both these mechanisms, weapons technology and military production technology in key defence sectors, such as combat aircraft, dispersed beyond the primary first-tier producers to the second and third tiers."
4365,即使如此，从两次世界大战间的前期开始，军事生产能力的等级结构几乎没有改变。,"Even so, the hierarchy of military-productive capability altered little from the early interwar years."
4365,随着战争的来临，军事技术的扩散越来越受到政府的管制，直到战后，特许生产才恢复到战前的水平。,"With the approach of war, the diffusion of military technology became increasingly regulated by governments, such that it was well into the postwar period before licensed production attained its prewar levels."
4366,"最后,一场甘霖有如千军万马,突然降临到人间。","When the rain finally did come, it came with a vengeance."
4366,"最初是雨中带雹,旋即转为骤雨,稍停以后又是一阵骤雨,雨势一直延续到第二天。",First it was accompanied by hail; then followed more intermittent downpours that lasted into the next day.Relief was instant.
4366,"这场雨发生在阳历6月12日,距离皇帝徒步天坛求雨已将近一月,但是任何人也不敢妄议这不是圣心感动上苍的结果。","The fact that this occurred on June 12, almost a whole month after the imperial procession to the Altar of Heaven, in no way deterred the emperor from claiming credit for himself."
4367,也正是这股强大的中立观点，使得一些象比尔徳那样明智的历史学家都怀疑奴隶制问题是否重要，值得那么讨论。,It is also this substantial body of opinion that has led intelligent historians such as Beard to doubt the importance of slavery as an issue.
4367,我认为他们的这个态度是错误的，非常错误的。,"That I hold to be an error, and a very serious one."
4367,然而，这种温和势力的失败和瓦解是问题的关键部分，那些对南方抱有同情心的人便有力地说明了这个问题。,"Nevertheless the failure and collapse of moderation constitute a key part of the story, one on which those with Southern sympathies have shed valuable light."
4367,要使战争危险日益迫近，除南方外，美国其它地方也需要发生了变化。,"For a situation to arise in which war was likely to occur, changes had to take place in other parts of the country besides the South."
4368,通货膨胀是16世纪和17世纪早期的一个主要经济问题。,Inflation was a major economic problem in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries.
4368,这种所谓的价格革命是整个欧洲的现象，尽管在不同时期不同地区受到的影响各不相同。,"This so-called price revolution was a Europe-wide phenomenon, although different areas were affected at different times."
4368,粮食价格最易增长，但是工资的增长赶不上价格的提高。,Foodstuffs were most subject to price increases.But wages failed to keep up with price increases.
4368,工资赚取者，尤其是农业工人和城市的领薪工人见证了他们生活水平的下降。,"Wage earners, especially agricultural laborers and salaried workers in urban areas, saw their standard of living drop."
4369,"我们在这里可以借用这样一种说法，那就是大不列颠帝国“把它的长手指伸到了世界各地”（FernAndez-Armesto, 1995，第264页）。","The British Empire, to borrow a phrase, 'stretched long fingertips over the world' (Fernández-Armesto, 1995, p. 264)."
4369,引起争议的不仅仅是欧洲早在几个世纪之前就已开始的连续扩张运动的进一步强化，而是在世界上主要地区所确立的包含新的统治和隶属关系的国际秩序。这种新秩序借助了新的信息传播工具和交通基础设施，后者有利于建立政治控制的新机制。,"At issue was not simply an intensification of European expansion along a continuum that ran back through earlier centuries, but a new ordering of relations of domination and subordination among the major regions of the world, aided by new communications and transport infrastructures which facilitated new mechanisms of political control."
4370,汽车工业无疑是战后经济繁荣期间的主导工业。,The car industry was arguably the lead industry during the postwar economic boom.
4370,美国的生产商，如福特和通用公司早已建立了经营机制。但是第二次世界大战后，它们前所未有地进行国际扩张，特别是进军欧洲市场。,"US producers, such as Ford and General Motors, had established operations, but the postwar period witnessed their unprecedented international expansion, into Europe particularly."
4370,随着美国公司在欧洲和其他地方建立大规模的生产装配线，国内市场保护和运输成本使外国直接投资成为服务这些市场的明显方式。,Protection of national markets and transport costs made FDI the obvious tool for serving these markets as US firms replicated mass production assembly lines in Europe and elsewhere.
4371,中国人一开始都是蒙古种人，他们在向东扩张至太平洋、向南扩张到越南的过程中，同化了那些游牧入侵者和较为原始的部落。,"The Chinese were all Mongoloids to begin with, as were their nomadic invaders and the relatively primitive tribes that they assimilated in the course of their expansion eastward to the Pacific and southward to Vietnam."
4371,因而，中国人在他们整个历史上享有同一种族和同一文化。,Thus the Chinese enjoyed racial and cultural homogeneity throughout their history.
4371,在古典时期，这种同一性如我们将看到的，得到进一步加强，因为中国人统一了文字，它使操各种极为不同的方言的人能互相交往。,"During the classical period this homogeneity was further cemented, as we shall see, by the standardization of the writing system, which enabled speakers of widely differing dialects to communicate with each other."
4372,这种传统的陈词滥调的大泛滥通常发生在统治阶级发现自己处境困难的时刻。,Such an upsurge of traditional rhetoric often occurs when a ruling class finds itself in a tight 【该部分原缺失，待核实原文！
4372,虽然“同治中兴”在短期取得了成功，但这种成功靠的是暂时加强那些反对从根本上重新改造中国社会的努力而取得的，这倒反而加速了他们自己末日的到来。,"】corner.Though the T’ung-chih Restoration succeeded for the moment, this very success may have hastened the ultimate end by temporarily strengthening those forces most opposed to a fundamental readjustment of Chinese society."
4372,从这一点上讲，从事“中兴”的政治家们恰恰为暴力推翻他们想保有的阶级和社会结构作出了贡献。,"In this way, Restoration statesmen may have contributed to the violent overthrow of the class and social institutions they sought to restore."
4373,此外，一国的危机会使资金从其他国家流出。,"Again, crises in one economy appeared to induce capital outflows from others."
4373,尽管国际货币基金组织（及工业化国家）制定了历史上最大的救援计划，力图稳定东亚金融形势，但危机的影响逐渐吞没了许多新兴经济体。,"Despite attempts by the IMF (and G7) to stabilize the financial situation in East Asia, through the provision of the largest rescue package in its history, the contagion effect of the crisis swiftly engulfed many emerging economies."
4373,1998年年底时，投机导致了卢比的贬值，并且冲击了许多国家的货币。,By late 1998 speculation had led to the devaluation of the rouble and speculative attacks on many other currencies.
4373,这些变动突出表明了短期资本流动在全球资本市场上造成的高度动荡和系统性风险的方式。,These developments underlined the ways in which short-term capital flows generate a high degree of volatility and systemic risk within global capital markets.
4374,幸运的是，福斯特为我们提供了法国图尔兹主教教区的详细研究，这里商品化的刺激十分強烈。同时，贵族也出色地控制着用于出售的谷物的生产。,"Fortunately Forster has presented us with a detailed study of the nobility in a part of France, the diocese of Toulouse, where the commercial impulse was strong and where grain growing for the market was a noble occupation par excellence."
4374,他的描述对于准确指出英国商业化的乡绅与法国具有商业精神的贵族之间的异同提供了可能性。,His account makes it possible to put one’s finger rather precisely on the similarities and differences between the improving gentry in England and their no less businesslike counterpart in France.
4375,暴乱(尽管它们很快被镇压下去了）展示了人们的激情以及社会的混乱状况。,"The riots, though suppressed without great difficulty, reveal the state of excitement and disorder."
4375,那些城市贫民由于通货膨胀也受到了猛烈的一击。,"The city poor, too, were hard hit by increasing inflation."
4375,军队的倒戈加剧了紧张的气氛。,Military reverses added to the highly charged atmosphere.
4375,1792年8月10日的起义风暴，即图拉里风暴和瑞士卫兵大屠杀，是巴黎民众，主要是贫苦的工匠和熟练的工人的又一次革命行动。,"The coup that cleared the air, the storming of the Tuileries and the famous slaughter of the Swiss Guards, August 10, 1792, was again the work of the Paris crowd, mainly poor artisans, journeymen, etc."
4375,革命的中心在巴黎，但是这种普遍的激进行动也得到了其他省区人民的支持。,"Though Paris was the center, the popular and radical movement received active support from the provinces."
4376,"在德川幕府的和平时期,武士几乎丧失了一切功能。","As warriors, they had already lost most of their function under the pax Tokugawa."
4376,1873年开始实行征兵制，使得他们身上残留的某些特点几乎一扫而光。,The introduction of conscriptions in 1873 eliminated practically all of the distinctions that remained to them on that score.
4376,最后，如桑塞姆在评论中所指出的：既然封建社会的基础是农民种地和封建主拥有土地，那么，土地所有权的开放，则是对封建尊严和特权的致命一击。,"Finally, the opening up of property rights in land, as Sansom remarks, struck at the heart of feudal pride and privilege, since feudal society rested on the 'working of the land by the peasant and its ownership by the 1ord."
4377,在法国南部的大部分地区，城市中较富裕的商业成员有一种与贵族和牧师携手联袂的强烈倾向；而这些贵族和牧师则希望利用吉伦特派和联邦主义运动做为君主复辟的阶梯。,"Throughout much of southern France the wealthier commercial element in the towns showed a strong inclination to join hands with the nobility and the clergy, who hoped to use the Gironde and the federalist movement as an entering wedge for the restoration of the monarchy."
4377,随着革命变得更为激进，斗争在一些城市呈现拉锯的状态。,"As the Revolution became more radical, a seesaw struggle developed in several of the cities."
4377,里昂、马赛、土伦和波沃多沦入与特权秩序结成联盟的富裕分子之手，并转而反对革命。,"Lyon, Marseilles, Toulon, and Bordeaux fell under the control of the wealthier element in alliance with the privileged orders and turned against the Revolution."
4378,中国的村庄，象其他国家一样，是农村社会的基本细胞。但和印度、日本甚至欧洲的一些地方相比较，中国的村庄显然缺少凝聚力。,"The Chinese village, the basic cell of rural society in China as elsewhere, evidently lacked cohesiveness in comparison with those of India, Japan, and even many parts of Europe."
4378,"村中大部分成员为一项共同的工作而进行合作的情况很 少发生,而这类事在一定程度上可以培养成员间休戚与共的习惯和感情。",There were far fewer occasions on which numerous members of the village cooperated in a common task in a way that creates the habits and sentiments of solidarity.
4379,同时，趁机报宿怨的部落之间也爆发了战争。,"At the same time, fighting broke out between tribes taking advantage of the opportunity to repay old scores."
4379,最严重的是，由于当地非洲政治家和比利时矿业集团结成邪恶的联盟，矿藏资源丰富的加丹加省实际上脱离了刚果。,"Most serious was the virtual secession of the rich mining province of Katanga, owing to an unholy alliance of local African politicians and Belgian mining interests."
4379,不断扩大的混乱状态迫使比利时政府重新进行考虑，将其军队派回要寨和飞机场。,The spreading anarchy caused the Belgian government to reconsider and to return its troops to key points and airfields.
4380,在巴黎和会上，日本确保住了从前的德属岛屿，但只是作为三级托管地而不是作为地道的领地。,"At the Paris Peace Conference Japan did retain control of the former German islands, but as Class C mandates under League of Nations auspices rather than as outright possessions."
4380,威尔逊总统拼命反对日本对无可争辩的中国领土山东的要求。,President Wilson strenuously opposed Japanese claims to the Chinese Shantung peninsula.
4380,作为妥协，日本被准许“暂时”占有这座半岛，但日本退一步承认它的“政策”是在某一日期把这片领土归还中国，“只保留‘以往一向’授与德国的经济特权”。,"As a compromise, Japan was confirmed in ""temporary"" possession of the peninsula, but it conceded that it was its ""policy"" to restore the territory to China at an unspecified date, ""retaining only the economic privileges [hitherto] granted to Germany.”"
4381,跨国公司海外活动强度的另一个标准可以通过海外分支机构的销售额与世界经济活动的比较来判断。,A further measure of the intensity of multinationals' overseas activity can be gauged by comparing sales of overseas affiliates to world economic activity.
4381,外国分支机构的销售量增长已大大超过了世界出口：70年代和80年代，它们与世界出口水平大体相当，而90年代后期，它们则高出30%（UNCTAD，1994，第130页；1997，第4页）。,"Sales of foreign affiliates have grown faster than world exports: in the 1970s and 1980s they had achieved levels comparable with world export levels but in the late 1990s they were around 30 per cent higher (UNCTAD, 1994, p. 130; 1997, p. 4)."
4381,外国分支机构的销售在世界国内生产总值中的比重从70年代的10〜15%上升到今天的大约25%。,Foreign affiliates' sales as a percentage of world GDP has risen from 10-15 per cent in the 1970s to around 25 per cent today.
4382,在军事外交逐渐制度化的同时，欧洲和美国的军事组织模式以及战略、战术模式也逐渐扩散和被效仿（参看Ralston，1990)。,"At much the same time as military diplomacy became institutionalized there was also a widening diffusion, as well as emulation, of European and American models of military organization, strategy and tactics (see Ralston, 1990)."
4382,在拉丁美洲、非洲和亚洲，西方国家帮助训练并武装本土的军事力量，其目的或者是为了补充帝国的军事力量，或是为了在争夺全球霸权的竞争中加强其非正式的军事联盟。,"Throughout Latin America, Africa, and Asia, Western states trained and equipped indigenous military forces, either to supplement imperial forces or to cement informal military alliances in the struggle for global power."
4382,甚至在日本和中国，军事和政治精英们积极寻求获得西方的军事支持和援助（Beasley，1995，第64页；Black，1998)。,"Even Japanese and Chinese military and political elites actively sought and acquired Western military assistance (Beasley, 1995, p. 64; Black, 1998)."
4383,相应地，国际参与在今天已经不仅仅是某一个国家或者其外交部门可以简单地选择追求或者放弃的东西。,"Accordingly, international engagement today is not something that a particular state, or its Ministry of Foreign Affairs, can simply choose to pursue or disregard."
4383,因为单单在国际法层面上，国际参与已不再是一个随意的选择。,"For at the level of international law alone, international engagement is not an option."
4383,数量剧增的政府部门，国内法庭和立法机构的活动正式或者非正式地反映了国际规则制定的政治、标准以及关注点。,"The activities of an increasing number of government departments, national courts and legislatures reflect the politics, standards and concerns of international rule-making, formal and informal."
4384,在世界某个角落所作的政治决定和发生的政治行为会迅速地传遍世界，并获得世界性的反响。,Political decisions and actions in one part of the world can rapidly acquire worldwide ramifications.
4384,此外，各个政治活动和（或）政策制定地可以通过快捷的信息传播途径连接成复杂的决策和政治互动网络。,"In addition, sites of political action and/or decision-making can become linked through rapid communications into complex networks of decision-making and political interaction."
4384,与这种“扩展”相连的是全球政治活动产生的，通常是“更向纵深发展的”影响。与古代和现代的帝国不同，“距离遥远的行为”可以以一种更强大的渗透力影响特定区域或政策共同体内的社会条件和认知世界。,"Associated with this ‘stretching' is a frequent ‘deepening' impact of global political processes such that, unlike in ancient and modern empires, 'action at a distance' permeates with greater intensity the social conditions and cognitive worlds of specific places or policy communities."
4385,这种冲突在随后政治角逐（例如1815年拿破仑的失败和1832年的起义）中不断地表现出来。,"Weakened imitations occurred again in subsequent political crises, Napoleon’s downfall in 1815 and in an ill-conceived Legitimist uprising in 1832."
4385,旺代省的反革命动乱在今天看来仍然是一个有趣的话题。因为它是唯一的一次以农民为主体的反对左派的起义。,The counterrevolution in the Vendee is a particularly piquant topic today because it is the only major peasant uprising directed against what is loosely called the Left.
4386,欧洲人第一次登上美洲的土地，带去了欧洲大陆上的动物、植物以及微生物，对于本土的各族来说，这是一个极为重要的事件（参见第6、8章）。,"The initial arrival of Europeans in Latin America with their collection of Eurasian flora, fauna and microbes was a shatteringly important event for the indigenous peoples (see chapters 6 and 8)."
4386,向美洲的移民以及从俄罗斯向西伯利亚的移民虽然暂时没有产生影响，但是最终造成了这些地区的人口、生态以及政治的变迁。,"Longer term flows of migration to the Americas and from Russia to Siberia had less immediate effect but eventually resulted in profound demographic, ecological and political shifts in these regions."
4386,奴隶贸易对非洲各种社会也有不同的影响，有的社会崩溃或者解体了，有的则通过合作生存下来。,The impact of the slave trade on African societies varied as some societies collapsed or disintegrated while others thrived on collaboration.
4387,20世纪晚期又出现了一股革新浪潮，与这次革新浪潮的速度和范围相比较，以前的技术相形见绌。这些技术包括；信息和图像的数字化、卫星广播和远程电话系统、新电缆和光纤技术以及计算机与通信网络的联合（计算机和通信网络的联合的最终的表现形式是互联网的全球化）。,"In the late twentieth century a further wave of innovations has emerged whose speed and range dwarf earlier technologies: digitization of information and images, satellite broadcasting and telephony systems, new cable and fibre-optic technologies and the integration of computer and telecommunications networks whose ultimate expression are the global networks of the World Wide Web."
4387,除了这些技术基础设施以外，许多国际机构和组织都努力寻求文化交流的全球规范。,Alongside these technological infrastructures a number of international agencies and organizations have sought some global regulation of cultural flows.
4388,从大众文化的层次上说，初看起来似乎是同质化过程实际上呈现出混合化特征。,"At the level of popular culture, what might at first sight appear to be processes of homogenization in fact display hybrid characteristics."
4388,没有任何文化信息、没有任何美观的人工制品也没有任何符号会存在于不受时空限制的文化真空。,"No cultural message, no aesthetic artefact, no symbol passes through time and space into a cultural vacuum."
4388,从消费者和接收者的角度来说，产品的生产和传播的文化环境最终总是会遇见一种已经存在的参照框架。,The cultural context of production and transmission must always in the end encounter an already existing frame of reference in the eyes of the consumer or receiver.
4389,持变革论观点的人认为，文化与人的相互融合与交流将产生混合文化和新的全球文化网络。,Those taking a transformationalist position describe the intermingling of cultures and peoples as generating cultural hybrids and new global cultural networks.
4389,我们将在后面对这些争论的各个方面进行讨论，但是很明显，这些观点主要讨论的是文化全球化对民族社群带来的影响。,"We will return to aspects of these debates later, but it is clear that these accounts are predominantly about the impact of contemporary cultural globalization on national communities."
4389,这产生了3个问题。,This raises three problems.
4390,尽管这与当代争论有着重要的相关性，但是，在没有解决民族国家和民族文化问题之前，要解决全球文化问题，这并不会有什么作用；第三，这些解释没有在以下两种影响之间作出仔细的区分，即国家文化认同和价值观发生的变化与国家文化构成的环境和过程发生的变化。,"While this is of central relevance to contemporary debates, it is of little use in tackling the world before nation-states and national cultures.Third, the accounts fail to differentiate adequately between impact qua changes to a national cultural identity and values, and impact qua the transformation of the context and processes of national cultural formation."
4390,正如我们将要看见的，这种区分具有重要意义。,"As we will show, this distinction is of fundamental importance."
4390,在这一章，我们既要努力对有关当代文化全球化的主要争论进行讨论，而且要利用在导论中建立起来的框架提出一种文化全球化的解释，这种解释可以反映不断变化的文化全球化的历史形态。,"In this chapter we seek both to engage with the dominant debates about contemporary cultural globalization and, utilizing the framework established in the introduction, to develop an account of cultural globalization that is sensitive to its changing historical forms."
4391,正如我们上面了解到的，早期的人类形成了小规模的群体，并产生了使自身得以生存的简单文化。,"As we have seen, early human beings formed small groups that developed a simple culture that enabled them to survive."
4391,随着人类社会的发展并更加趋于复杂，人类存在的一种新的形式——文明——开始形成。,"As human societies grew and developed greater complexity, a new form of human existence---called civilization---came into being."
4391,文明是一种复杂的文化，大量处于其中的人类拥有一些共同的基本特征。,A civilization is a complex culture in which large numbers of human beings share a number of common elements.
4392,14世纪，伴随着黑死病和瘟疫的复发，出现了大量病态的作品，艺术在多个领域也同时兴起。,The fourteenth century produced an artistic outburst in new directions as well as a large body of morbid work influenced by the Black Death and the recurrence of the plague.
4392,通过乔托的作品，中世纪的传统在佛罗伦萨第一次出现巨大突破，乔托被认为是意大利文艺复兴绘画的先驱。,"The city of Florence witnessed the first dramatic break with medieval tradition in the work of Giotto (1266--1337), often considered a forerunner of Italian Renaissance painting."
4392,他的足迹几乎遍及意大利，但他最著名的作品是在帕多瓦和佛罗伦萨完成的。,"Although he worked throughout Italy, Giotto’s most famous works were done in Padua and Florence."
4393,许多环境威胁产生的原因或带来的结果完全是地区性的，很少或根本就不存在任何社会关系的延伸或污染物质在时空上的运动。,Many threats are highly localized in both their origins and consequences with little or no stretching of social relationships or movements of pollutants through space and time.
4393,许多种类的污染，如光化学烟雾和有毒重金属的泄漏等影响的范围非常小。,"Many forms of pollution, like photochemical smogs and the release of toxic heavy metals, have a small radius of action."
4393,同样，许多种类的水污染也都是地方性的或至多是国内的。,"Similarly, many forms of water pollution result from local or at least national sources."
4394,在募兵过程中，马略发起了军事改革，结果带来了巨大的影响。,"In raising a new army, Marius initiated military reforms that proved to have drastic consequences."
4394,罗马军队传统上是招募小农场主。,The Roman army had traditionally been a conscript army of small landholders.
4394,马略征募的则是城市和乡下的亳无财产而自愿入伍的人，他们发誓效忠将军，而不是元老院，这样就开了征召不再受制于政府的职业型军队之先河。,"Marius recruited volunteers from both the urban and rural proletariat who possessed no property.These volunteers swore an oath of loyalty to the general, not the senate, and thus inaugurated a professional-type army that might no longer be subject to the state."
4394,此外，为了征募他们，将军要许诺给予他们土地，这样为了实现通过关于向其退伍老兵提供土地的立法，将军又不得不参政。,"Moreover, to recruit these men, a general would promise them land, so the generals had to play politics to get legislation passed that would provide the land for their veterans."
4394,马略留下丰厚的遗产，他创立了可以集多种大权于将军一人之手的新征募制度。,Marius left a powerful legacy.He had created a new system of military recruitment that placed much power in the hands of the individual generals.
4395,"甚至第三个五年计划也承认，租佃立法在实际上所造成的冲击远非原先希望的那样有效。因为地主们在佃农自愿放弃的托词下,大肆驱逐佃农。","Even the text of the Third Five Year Plan concedes that the impact of tenancy legislation in practice has been less than hoped for, because landlords have ejected tenants under the plea of voluntary surrenders."
4395,到1963年末，据各邦记载，情況的改善在各个地区也很不一致。,"The record of the states in improving matters remained very spotty down to the end of 1963, more than a decade after the changes began."
4395,现场的观察和地区性的研究表明变化微乎其微。,Observations made on the spot and local studies indicate very little change.
4395,丹尼尔•托那在1960年总结道：“从根本上说，大人物掌握着大量的土地，而他们役使许多人为自己种田。”,"Daniel Thorner in 1960 concluded that ""In essence the bigger people have held on to a lot of land, and they are getting others to cultivate it for them."""
4396,两个世纪后，类似的命运在等待着澳大利亚和新西兰的一些地方。,A similar fate awaited parts of Australia and New Zealand two centuries later.
4396,美洲物种越过大西洋被带回到欧洲，对欧洲的环境和社会发展产生了重要作用。,The return journey across the Atlantic of American species also provided important forces in shaping the environmental and social development of Europe.
4396,例如，马铃薯成了外围欧洲农民的主要农作物，它改变了他们的定居模式和人口增长模式，烟草带来的环境后果一点也不小(Salaman，1947)。,"The potato, for example, became the staple crop of much of peripheral peasant Europe, transforming patterns of settlement and population growth.The environmental consequences of tobacco are scarcely smaller (Salaman, 1947)."
4397,不管他的理想、动机和对自我的看法如何，有一点事实很清楚：亚历山大确实开创了一个新时代——希腊化时代。,"Regardless of his ideals, motives, or views about himself, one fact stands out: Alexander created a new age, the Hellenistic era."
4397,“希腊化”一词源于希腊语，意思是“仿效希腊”。,The word Hellenistic is derived from a Greek word meaning “to imitate Greeks.”
4397,描绘这一时代的一个很恰当的说法就是，它是把希腊的语言和思想传播到近东地区非希腊世界的一个时代。,"It is an appropriate way, then, to describe an age that saw the extension of the Greek language and ideas to the non-Greek world of the Near East."
4398,犹太复国主义运动发展中的一个关键人物是西奥多·赫茨尔 (1860—1904)。,A key figure in the growth of Zionism was Theodor Herzl (1860--1904).
4398,1896年，他出版了《犹太国》一书，书中宣称：“那些希望有自己国家的犹太人将会梦想成真。,"In 1896, he published a book called The Jewish State in which he advocated that “the Jews who wish it will have their state.”"
4398,” 然而，当时在巴勒斯坦定居是件比较困难的事情，因为那里在当时还是奥斯曼帝国的一部分，而该帝国是反对犹太人移入的。,"Settlement in Palestine was difficult, however, because it was then part of the Ottoman Empire, which was opposed to Jewish immigration."
4399,于是这些农民或是逃亡北部边境地区，用武力赶走住居在那里的虾夷人，或是将自己连同土地一起交托给拥有采邑的贵族。,"They in turn either fled to the northern frontier areas where the Ainu were being pushed back by force of arms, or else commended themselves and their lands to lords of manors."
4399,这样，他们可以免税，并得到保护，但却因此变成农奴。,"This freed them of taxes and provided them with protection, but at the cost of becoming serfs."
4399,结果，到12世纪末，纳税土地只是整个耕地面积的百分之十，甚至更少，地方权力被新的农村贵族所接管。,"The net result of this process was that by the end of the twelfth century, tax-paying land amounted to 10 percent or less of the total cultivated area, and local power had been taken over by the new rural aristocracy."
4400,第五，文化全球化的分层现象正在迅速发生变化。,"Fifth, the stratification of cultural globalization is changing rapidly."
4400,从欧洲现代化开始，文化流动主要沿着帝国控制的路线，从西方流向世界其他地方。,"Since the advent of European modernity, cultural flows were primarily from the West to the rest, following lines of imperial control."
4400,在当代世界，文化流动仍然主要发生在西方，而且主要出现在西方越来越强大的文化机构范围内——广播公司、新闻机构、音乐和电影产业以及大学等。,"In the contemporary world, the flows continue to be generated primarily in the West and in its more powerful cultural institutions---broad casters, press agencies, music and film industries, universities, etc."
4401,本章将利用当代和历史的证据建构一个阐释自现代早期以来商品和服务的跨国生产、销售的组织是如何发展的大致框架。,Using contemporary and historical evidence this chapter seeks to construct a synoptic account of how the organization of cross-border production and distribution of goods/services has evolved since the early modern era.
4401,总之，这是一次勾勒商业活动全球化的时空和组织范围概貌的尝试(见导论)。,Broadly it is an attempt to map historically the spatio-temporal and organizational dimensions of the globalization of business activity (see the introduction).
4401,因此，我们将考察国际商业活动的广度、强度、速度及影响，以及分层化和制度化的重要模式、主导性互动模式和在不同历史时期支撑生产全球化的基础设施状况。,"Thus it examines the extensity, intensity, velocity and impact of international business activity, as well as the significant patterns of stratification and institutionalization, the dominant modes of interaction and the infrastructural conditions which have underpinned the globalization of production in different historical epochs."
4402,罗马人的艺术灵感也受希腊的影响。,The Romans were also dependent on the Greeks for artistic inspiration.
4402,公元前2、3世纪时，他们吸收希腊化艺术风格的诸多特征。,"During the third and second centuries B.C., they adopted many features of the Hellenistic style of art."
4402,罗马人产生了对希腊雕塑的喜好，他们不仅把希腊雕塑立于公共建筑群中，还摆放在家中。,"The Romans developed a taste for Greek statues, which they placed not only in public buildings but also in their homes."
4402,一旦需求超过了原创艺术品的供应力，相应的复制品就会风行，罗马自己的肖像雕塑以浓厚的现实主义为特征，甚至包括令人不快的细节。,"Once demand outstripped the supply of original works, reproductions of Greek statues became fashionable.The Romans’ own portrait sculpture was characterized by an intense realism that included even unpleasant physical details."
4402,壁画以现实主义风格描绘了风景、肖像和神秘故事的场景。,"Wall paintings and frescoes in the houses of the rich realistically depicted landscapes, portraits, and scenes from mythological stories."
4403,俾斯麦经常被描绘为一位终极的现实主义者，一位19世纪的最优秀的现实主义政治的实践者。,"Bismarck has often been portrayed as the ultimate realist, the foremost nineteenth-century practitioner of Realpolitik."
4403,他对于任何反对他的人的厌恶之情也都溢于言表。,He was also quite open about his strong dislike of anyone who opposed him.
4403,他曾在一个早晨对他的妻子说：“我整夜都无法入睡，我整晚都在愤恨。”,"He said one morning to his wife, ""I could not sleep the whole night; I hated throughout the whole night."""
4404,虽然后来为了书写方便简化为两种字体，但象形文字从没有演化成字母。,"Although hieroglyphs were later simplified into two scripts for writing purposes, they never developed into an alphabet."
4404,埃及象形文字最初刻在了石头上，但后来这两种简化字体写在了一种用长在尼罗河岸边的纸莎草制成的草纸上。,"Egyptian hieroglyphs were initially carved in stone, but later the two simplified scripts were written on papyrus, a paper made from the papyrus reed that grew along the Nile."
4404,大多数流传至今的埃及文学作品就是书写在了纸莎草纸书册和木板上。,Most of the ancient Egyptian literature that has come down to us was written on papyrus rolls and wooden tablets.
4405,在1914年前，跨国公司就将新的产品和生产过程引入东道国。第一次世界大战后这一过程则有加速之势。,Even before 1914 MNCs were introducing new products and processes into host counties and this accelerated in the interwar period.
4405,跨国公司引进了新制成的食品和饮料。此后，这些产品都变成了驰名世界的商标品牌。,MNCs introduced new processed food and drink products that have since become worldwide brand names.
4405,"美国的跨国公司开始在国外生产轿车和其他主要消费品；例如，此间福特和通用汽车公司在欧洲和日本建立了轿车生产工厂（Wilkins, 1974,第4章）","US multinationals began to manufacture cars and other major consumer goods abroad; for example, Ford and General Motors established car plants in Europe and Japan during this period (Wilkins, 1974, ch. 4)."
4406,另外，在1991年马斯特里赫特高峰会议上达成的条约所寻求的不仅是经济与货币联盟的范围的扩大，还有政治一体化的框架向其他领域的延伸。,"The treaty agreed at the Maastricht summit of 1991 seeks, moreover, not only to extend the scope of economic and monetary union, but also to extend the framework of political integration to other spheres."
4406,特別是，它推动了欧盟公民身份这一概念的发展：每一个欧盟成员国的国家公民，现在也是欧盟的公民，拥有在欧盟内部任何地方旅行和居住权、投票权以及抗议其居住国政治当局的权利。,"In particular, it significantly advances the notion of EU citizenship: every national citizen of a member country of the EU is now also a citizen of the Union with the right to travel and reside anywhere within the EU and the right to vote and contest political office in the country of their residence."
4406,相应地，旧的政治边界的重要性进一步减弱，领土消解的进程在继续。,"Accordingly, the importance of old political borders further declines and the process of deterritorialization continues."
4407,因为其他因素改变或强化了这个趋势，这些运动突然停止了国际趋同。,These movements stopped short of complete convergence as other factors modified or accentuated these trends.
4407,在两次大战之间，随着贸易保护盛行，这种全球趋同的趋势停止了。30年代后期，工资、利润和租金实际上差别很大。,"This tendency to global convergence ceased in the interwar years as protectionism increased, and wages, profits and rents actually diverged worldwide during the late 1930s."
4407,在劳动力密集的欧洲国家，实际工资下降了，而富有土地的美国则经历了一次严重的农业萧条。,"In labour-abundant European countries real wages fell, while the land-abundant USA experienced a severe agricultural depression."
4408,大量的农民负债并丧失自己的耕地，这到底有多少人，在专家中还有争议。,A good many peasants fell into debt and lost their farms.How many is a matter of dispute among specialists.
4408,虽然新政权允许农民有财产权，但在实际上，因为除了钱和口头惯例外别无所靠，所以小户人家经常失败。而“法律”在村里头人就代表了官方的法律——通常是站在大土地所有者一边的。,"Although the new regime had granted property rights to the peasants, in the actual settlement the little man often lost out because, he had nothing but memory and oral tradition to rely upon, while the “law” 一in the person of the village headman as well as officials — generally sided with the large holder."
4409,这些变化部分地反映了变化着的世界贸易结构。,These shifts partly reflect the changing composition of world trade.
4409,尽管第二次世界大战以前初级产品占贸易的大部分份额，但是自80年代以来，制成品和日益增长的服务贸易主导着第二次世界大战后的贸易。,"Whereas primary goods made up the majority of trade before the Second World War, postwar trade has been dominated by manufactures along with increasing levels of services trade since the 1980s."
4409,但如前所述，发展中国家不再仅仅是初级产品出口国，而且开始从事制成品和服务贸易。,"But, as noted, developing states are no longer simply exporters of primary products but are engaged increasingly in trade in manufactures and services."
4409,一种新的劳动分工正在形成，并且对世界贸易分层有重要影响。,A new international division of labour is evolving which has important consequences for the stratification of world trade.
4410,虽然国家内部特定的团体会因为全球竞争而受到损害，但是几乎所有的国家在生产特定商品上都有比较优势，可以长期利用。,"While particular groups within a country may be made worse off as a result of global competition, nearly all countries have a comparative advantage in producing certain goods which can be exploited in the long run."
4410,新马克思主义者和激进主义者认为这样“乐观的观点”没有根据，他们相信全球资本主义在国家内部和国家之间制造并且强化了不平等的结构模式。,"Neo-Marxists and radicals regard such an ‘optimistic view' as unjustified, believing that global capitalism creates and reinforces structural patterns of inequality within and between countries."
4410,但是他们至少在这一点上同意新自由主义的看法：社会保护的传统福利形式不断陷入困境并且难以维持。,
4410,,But they agree at least with their neoliberal counterparts that traditional welfare options for social protection are looking increasingly threadbare and difficult to sustain.
4411,对于许多激进共和主义者来说，变革的能动者来自观有的（批判的）社会运动，如环境、妇女以及和平运动，它们不仅挑战着国家和同际机构的权威，而且挑战着正统的“政治”定义。,"For many radical republicans the agents of change are to be found in existing (critical) social movements, such as the environmental, women's and peace movements, which challenge the authority of states and international agencies as well as orthodox definitions of the 'political'."
4411,通过一种抵抗和授权政治，这些新社会运动被认为在全球民主化中发挥了关键作用，如同像劳工运动这样的（传统的）社会运动在争取国内民主中的作用一样。,"Through a politics of resistance and empowerment these new social movements are conceived as playing a crucial role in global democratization similar to the role of the (old) social movements, such as organized labour, in the struggle for national democracy."
4411,这些新运动面对全球张态、经济和安全危机，积极动员着跨国共同体的抵抗和团结。,"These new movements are engaged in mobilizing transnational communities of resistance and solidarity against impending global ecological, economic and security crises."
4411,它们追求的是实现社会和经济平等，建立自我发展必需的条件，以及建立自我管理的共同体。,
4412,正是由于这种平等主义，无论是新石器时代的部落社会，还是今天的部落社会，其生产力都有着内在的妨碍因素。,"Precisely because of this equality, tribal societies, whether of Neolithic times or of today, have a built-in brake on productivity."
4412,产品的产量只要适应每个家庭有限的传统的需要就可以了，没有要求生产剩余产品的动力。,"Output is geared to the limited traditional needs of the family, so there is no incentive to produce a surplus."
4412,也就是说，劳动只是生活中的一个插曲，其内容多样，时间却相当有限。,
4412,,"This in turn means that labor is sporadic, diversified, and correspondingly limited."
4413,贸易对发达国家最激烈的影响来自获得生产技术的低成本生产商。新兴工业化经济体中制成品出口商的兴起就是明证。,"The most radical structural impact of trade on developed economies comes from low-cost producers acquiring production technology, as is evident in the rise of manufactures exporters in the NIEs."
4413,此外，这种影响不是彻底使发达国家的所有生产商全部消失。,Again the effect of this is not to wipe out all producers in developed countries.
4413,如果生产力水平低，即使是最先进的新兴工业化经济体也会落后于发达国家（Dollar和Wolff，1993，第8章）。,"Even the most advanced NIEs still lag behind the leading industrial nations technologically, giving them significantly lower productivity levels (Dollar and Wolff, 1993, ch. 8)."
4414,尽管国际货币基金组织（及工业化国家）制定了历史上最大的救援计划，力图稳定东亚金融形势，但危机的影响逐渐吞没了许多新兴经济体。,"Despite attempts by the IMF (and G7) to stabilize the financial situation in East Asia, through the provision of the largest rescue package in its history, the contagion effect of the crisis swiftly engulfed many emerging economies."
4414,1998年年底时，投机导致了卢比的贬值，并且冲击了许多国家的货币。,By late 1998 speculation had led to the devaluation of the rouble and speculative attacks on many other currencies.
4414,这些变动突出表明了短期资本流动在全球资本市场上造成的高度动荡和系统性风险的方式。,These developments underlined the ways in which short-term capital flows generate a high degree of volatility and systemic risk within global capital markets.
4415,然而，通信基础设施的扩大并不只是增加了全世界的交往，而牺牲了国家交往，因为它既促进了国内交往的发展又促进了跨国文化交流。,"The growth of infrastructures of communication did not, however, simply increase worldwide communication at the expense of the national, for it facilitated an increase both in national communication patterns and in transnational cultural flows."
4415,20世纪晚期又出现了一股革新浪潮，与这次革新浪潮的速度和范围相比较，以前的技术相形见绌。这些技术包括：信息和图像的数字化、卫星广播和远程电话系统、新电缆和光纤技术以及计算机与通信网络的联合（计算机和通信网络的联合的最终的表现形式是互联网的全球化）。,"In the late twentieth century a further wave of innovations has emerged whose speed and range dwarf earlier technologies: digitization of information and images, satellite broadcasting and telephony systems, new cable and fibre-optic technologies and the integration of computer and telecommunications networks whose ultimate expression are the global networks of the World Wide Web."
4415,除了这些技术基础设施以外，许多国际机构和组织都努力寻求文化交流的全球规范。,Alongside these technological infrastructures a number of international agencies and organizations have sought some global regulation of cultural flows.
4416,反理性、反工业社会前景的加图主义，把现代都市文明看作性的贬値，看作人际关系的冷漠化和非人格化。,"As part of the generally anti-intellectual and anti-industrial outlook of Catonism, modern urban civilization is seen as somehow devaluing sex, as making human relationships cold and impersonal."
4416,因此人们专注于性冷淡和阳萎，美化性关系，有如“查特莱女士之恶”一书所表现的那样。,"Hence the preoccupation with frigidity and impotence, the glorification of sex, as for example in Lady Chatterley's Lover."
4416,另外，因为性构成家庭、家族和国家的基础，加图主义又有一种邪恶的淫乱气氛 。,"On the other hand, there is an air of guilty prurience about all this because sex has to be the basis of the home, the family, the state."
4417,然而，早期的这些修道士无法获得孤独。,"These early monks, however, soon found themselves unable to live in solitude."
4417,他们神圣的业绩吸引着大量的追随者，并且随着修道士形象传遍东方，基于实际公共生活的新型修道院制度不久成为一种主导的形式。,"Their feats of holiness attracted followers on a wide scale, and as the monastic ideal spread throughout the east, a new form of monasticism based on the practice of communal life soon became the dominant form."
4417,修道士共同体成为了理想的基督教社会，可以向其周围更大范围的社会提供道德典范。,Monastic communities came to be seen as the ideal Christian society that could provide a moral example to the wider society around them.
4418,期货仅仅是在商定的未来时间以商定的价格交易一定量产品——货币、商品、侦券、股票等——的合约。,"Futures are simply an agreement to trade a quantity of a product --- currency, commodity, bonds, shares, etc. --- at an agreed future date for an agreed price."
4418,期权则是给持有人一种权利，使其能够在特定时间的特定的价格购买特定量的产品。,An option gives the holder the right to buy an agreed quantity of a product at an agreed price on an agreed date.
4418,掉期指的是经纪人交换两种资产的支付——例如，两个借贷者可以在固定和浮动利率贷款之间交换支付。,"A swap is where agents swap the payments associated with two assets --- for example, two borrowers may swap payments between a fixed and a floating interest rate loan."
4418,衍生品使经纪人可以对冲产品基本价格贬值带来的风险，它们还提供投机方式以防价格波动，因为首期支付只是合同名义价值的一部分，经纪人能够调动巨额资金。,"Derivatives allow agents to hedge themselves against the risk of adverse movements in the underlying price of a product.They also offer the means to speculate heavily against movements in prices since the initial outlay is only a fraction of the notional value of the contract, enabling agents to gear up very large sums."
4419,早期的德川统治者们把武士从土地上分离出来，就是打算把农民对国家的财政义务体现为向政府交纳公共税，而不是采取个人对封建主承担义务的形式。,The separation of the warrior from the land by the early Tokugawa rulers meant that the peasant’s financial obligations to the government took on the appearance of public taxes to the government rather than personal dues to the lord.
4419,这并不是陈词滥调，早期的个人的徭役逐渐转变成了公众的徭役。,"There were no banalities, and the earlier personal corvee was gradually being incorporated into the corvee for the public."
4419,这种公众义务的形式，可能使农民对封建领主的忠诚更容易转变为对近代国家的忠诚，这种转变主要是在明治维新时完成的。,"Very likely this appearance of public obligations helped to ease the peasant’s transfer of loyalty from the feudal Overlord to the modern state, when the time came to do so in the Meiji Reform."
4420,业余乐趣可能是也始终是肤浅和无能的藉口。,The ideal of the amateur can and has served as an excuse for superficiality and incompetence.
4420,虽然贵族们有助于美学目光的保留，但他们又对虚荣浮华和谄媚奉承产生了强烈影响。,"If the aristocracy has helped to preserve the independence of the aesthetic dimension, it has also exerted very strong pressures toward mere decoration and flattery.Sheer snobbishness, i.e."
4420,纯粹的势利眼，没有任何理性基础的竞富夸豪，在这里起了极端重要的作用。,", the drawing of social distinctions and the awarding of prestige without any rational basis, has played a tremendous part."
4420,维希伦的“有闲阶级论一书”，并不是一幅高明的讽刺画，但却是洞中时弊的。,Veblen’s snide caricature in the Theory of the Leisure Class seizes essential aspects of the truth.
4421,为了限制这种性方面过度的自由，教会逐渐强化自己在婚姻中的地位并将婚姻基督教化。,"To limit such sexual license, the church increasingly emphasized its role in marriage and attempted to Christianize it."
4421,应该说，婚姻是一种世俗的安排，教士极力在仪式中增加祈祷的程序，并强化婚姻仪式的特殊观念。,"Although marriage was a civil arrangement, priests tried to add their blessings and strengthen the concept of a special marriage ceremony."
4421,为了稳定婚姻，教会还开始宣传一夫一妻制和永久婚姻。,"To stabilize marriages, the church also began to emphasize monogamy and permanence."
4422,这一文明于公元前2500年左右达到成熟期，在以后的1000年中，实际上处于静止不变的状态，而且，甚至达到这样的程度，这些城市每遭到洪水毁灭性的破坏后，重建的新城市总是造得跟原来的城市一模一样。,"After it reached its maturity about 2500 B.C., it remained virtually static during the following millennium.Even when cities were destroyed by floods, the new cities were built to duplicate the old."
4422,如此一贯、连续的传统世上从来没有过，即使在埃及也没有，因而，产生这样一种假说：控制这一纪律严明的社会的也许是一种精神上的力量。,"Such undeviating continuity of tradition has had no equal, even in Egypt, and has given rise to the theory that the authority regulating this disciplined society may have been spiritual."
4422,没有军事装备，没有城防工事，也为这一假说提供了证据。,This hypothesis is supported also by the absence of military equipment and fortifications.
4423,但是，联合国的宪章体系在许多方面还是具有独特的创新性和影响力的。,"However, the UN Charter system has also been distinctively innovative and influential in a number of ways."
4423,它提供了个国际审议论坛，在这里，原则上所有的国家在某些方面都是平等的；对许多发展中国家来说，对那些寻求对某些国际问题的“一致性的”解决方式的基础的国家来说，论坛具有独特的价值。,"It has provided an international deliberative forum in which, in principle, all states are equal in certain respects, a forum of particular value to many developing countries and to those seeking a basis for 'consensus' solutions to international problems."
4423,它为非殖民化，为寻求国际制度改革提供了一个正式的框架。,"It has provided a formal framework for decolonization, and for the pursuit of the reform of international institutions."
4424,所以，有成就的商人的志向是获取地产、购买陷入穷困的王室所出卖的爵位，从而抛弃自己的阶级，成为伊达戈。,"Consequently, the ambition of successful merchants was to acquire estates and buy titles, which were sold by the impoverished crown; and thus abandon their class and become hidalgos."
4424,这种伊达戈精神的破坏性影响在经济的各部门——在对牧羊业而非农业所显示的偏爱里，在对勤劳的犹太人和穆斯林的驱逐以及议会对商业和工业利益所持的否定态度中——均可感觉到。,"The blighting influence of this hidalgo spirit was felt in all branches of the economy --- In the favoritism shown toward sheep farming as opposed to agriculture, in the expulsion of the industrious Jews and Moslems, and in the negative attitude of the Cortes assembly toward commercial and industrial interests."
4424,因此，16世纪上半世纪中西班牙突然繁荣的经济最终衰退了。,"As a result of these attitudes, the economic spurt that occurred in Spain in the first half of the sixteenth century ended in failure."
4425,即使是美国，毫无疑问它有独立行动的军事能力，但它所卷入的全球责任和承诺的复杂网络，涉及到它跨越其邻近领土而使用武力时，也要斡旋各军事力量的行动，正如1998年的伊拉克危机所显示的。,"But even in the case of the US, which undoubtedly has the military capability to act independently, the complex web of global commitments in which it is entangled mediates the exercise of military power in respect of the use of force beyond its immediate territory, as the 1998 Iraq crisis demonstrated."
4425,尽管对绝大多数发达资本主义国家来说，与关于国家安全的最关键的决策相连的国家主权，无法被一个更高的权威所掠夺，但是，就军事和安全事务进行的决策，在某种程度上被国家卷入世界军事秩序的当代模式所削弱。在实践中，现存的军事和安全关系、义务和责任影响着不同政策选择的成本和收益，还可以确定多边的协商，甚至是联盟的共同决策。,"Although for most SIACS national sovereignty with respect to the most critical decisions about national security has by no means been usurped by a higher authority, decision-making on military and security matters is, nevertheless, compromised by contemporary patterns of national enmeshment in the world military order to the extent that, in practice, existing military and security relations, obligations and commitments influence the costs and benefits of different policy choices, while they also presume multilateral consultation or even alliance co-decision."
4426,由于受到奧斯曼帝国、蒙古帝国和伊斯兰国家的遏制，基督教的欧洲在十字军东征后一直处于一种防御性军事状态。,"Contained by the considerable military might of the Ottoman Empire, the Mongols and Islam, Christian Europe had adopted a largely defensive military posture in the aftermath of the Crusades."
4426,另外，欧洲的主权受到国内和洲内权力争夺的干扰。,"Moreover, Europe's sovereigns were significantly exercised by domestic and continental power struggles."
4426,"但是值得注意的是，在18世纪末，欧洲列强总共获得了对世界35%陆地面积的政治控制(Headrick,1981,第3页)。","Yet, remarkably, by the close of the eighteenth century the major European powers together had acquired political control of 35 per cent of the world's land area (Headrick, 1981, p.3)."
4427,《古兰经》是穆斯林的圣书，类似于基督教的《圣经》。,"The Qur’an is the sacred book of the Muslims, comparable to the Bible in Christianity."
4427,这部分选自22章，标题为“朝圣”，该章探讨了前往麦加朝圣的重要性，朝圣是伊斯兰教五功之一。,"This selection from Sura 22, titled ""Pilgrimage,"" discusses the importance of making a pilgrimage to Mecca, one of the Five Pillars of Islam."
4427,朝圣的最后目标是麦加的克尔白，那里供有黑石。,"The pilgrim’s final destination was the Ka’ba at Mecca, containing the Black Stone."
4428,但制药工业需要大量的研发投入，这种情况在地理上相当集中，总投入的一半以上分布在五大工业国和瑞士。,"But pharmaceutical products require enormous research and development expenditures.This is heavily concentrated geographically, with over half of total expenditure located in the G5 countries plus Switzerland."
4428,战后大部分时间里，制药工业反映了跨国公司在国内生产全球性竞争产品的逻辑。,For much of the postwar period pharmaceuticals reflects the logic of companies generating globally competitive products from their national base.
4428,然而，渐渐地这也证明是不充分的。,"Increasingly, however, this is proving to be insufficient."
4429,我们将通过对边境控制和监督的讨论来阐述国家主权和自主的3个重要方面。,Three important aspects of state sovereignty and autonomy are illuminated by the discussion of border control and surveillance.
4429,首先，国家与移民(尤其是那些寻求逃脱边境控制的人)之间的集体力量的对比已经随着时间的改变而变化了。,"First, the balance of collective power between states and migrants --- particularly those who seek to evade border controls --- has shifted over time."
4429,随着移民机构的建立、公民身份文件化以及通过港口和飞机场对移民进行控制等，发达资本主义国家的力量已经得到了增强。,
4429,,"The powers of SIACS have been increased by the establishment of immigration agencies, the documentation of citizenship and the funnelling of migrants through harbours and airports."
4430,"移民社群本身在创造工作和扩大交易方面也起着非常重要的作用（Li【该处人名拼写不确定，需核实原文】A Global History: from Prehistory to the 21st Centuryt和Bonacich,1988; Waldingcr等, 1990)。","Immigrant communities have also been significant in creating jobs and businesses themselves (Li【该处人名拼写不确定，需核实原文】A Global History: from Prehistory to the 21st Centuryt and Bonacich, 1988; Waldinger et al., 1990)."
4430,在英国，亚洲企业家使零售贸易重新出现新的活力，满足了纺织业和服装业的发展。,"In Britain, Asian entrepreneurs have revitalized the retail, catering, textile and clothing industries."
4430,德国的土耳其人、法国的阿尔及利亚人以及美国的韩国人和中国人都分別在这些国家作出了同样的贡献。,"They have their counterparts among Turks in Germany, Algerians in France, and Koreans and Chinese in the USA."
4431,同样，在其它方面，商人们在艺术和娱乐生活中发展出某种独特的社会特征和口味，使我们回忆起西方前清教主义的商业文化。,It is also true that in some of the arts and in the lighter pleasures of life the merchants developed some distinctive social traits and tastes that recall the pre-Puritan aspects of mercantile culture in the West.
4431,这种商业文化在18世纪初达到了顶峰，但这并没有对德川体制构成威胁。这基本上是一种尚能容忍的越轨，主要限制在首都的一个特定地区，并起着安全阀的怍用。,"But this merchant culture, that reached the height of its flowering by the beginning of the eighteenth century, was no real threat in itself to the Tokugawa system,  Essentially this tolerated licentiousness, mainly restricted to a particular quarter of the capital, served as a safety valve."
4431,不管怎样，与其说它起了摧毁旧秩序的作用，还不如说起到了保存旧秩序的作用。,"If anything, it helped to preserve rather than destroy the ancien regime."
4432,尽管世界宗教的创立可以向前提早几千年，但是我们可以将它们最初的影响浓缩到从公元前300年到公元700年之间约1000年内。,"Although the foundation of world religions stretches back over a number of millennia, we can compress their initial impact to around a thousand-year period between 300 BCE and 700 CE."
4432,佛教和印度教在耶稣诞生前3个世纪就出现了类似当代形式的形式，而伊斯兰教到公元700年时已经到达了它的核心地区。,"Buddhism and Hinduism assumed something like their contemporary form in the three centuries before Jesus's birth, while Islam had reached its core regions by about 700 CE."
4432,在这1000年的时间内，宗教扩张的主要载体是有组织的牧师等级制度。,
4432,,Over this thousand-year period the main agencies of religious expansion were organized clerical hierarchies.
4433,卡米耶·毕沙罗（1830—1903)是印象派的奠基人之一，他曾经表述他们所寻求的目标：“精确的绘画干巴巴的，妨碍对于整体的印象，破坏了所有的感觉。不要过分逼真地追求事物的轮廓，应该在运用了正确的色彩和笔法的画笔下创作画作……要同时绘制天空、水面、树枝和大地，要使所有东西在一个同样的基础上表现出来，不停地画，直到你得到自己想要的东西为止……不要依照规则和原理作画，而要出你所现察到的和感觉到的。要大胆地、毫不犹豫地绘画，因为最好的情况就是不要去掉第一印象。,"Camille Pissarro (1830--1903), one of Impressionism’s founders, expressed what they sought: “Precise drawing is dry and hampers the impression of the whole, it destroys all sensations. Do not define too closely the outlines of things; it is the brush stroke of the right value and color which should produce the drawing. . . .Work at the same time upon sky, water, branches, ground, keeping everything going on an equal basis and unceasingly rework until you have got it. . . . Don’t proceed according to rules and principles, but paint what you observe and feel. Paint generously and unhesitatingly, for it is best not to lose the first impression.”"
4433,” 诸如毕沙罗这样的印象派画家都试图将他们对于自然界事物中光线效果变化的印象付诸画笔。,Impressionists like Pissarro sought to put into painting their impressions of the changing effects of light on objects in nature.
4434,最后，我们来看看东欧。东欧在1989年之前被完全与区域性和全球性迁移流隔离开来。,"Finally, we turn to Eastern Europe, which up until 1989 was effectively cordoned off from regional and global migratory flows."
4434,随着这些国家的解体及其限制严格的移民政策的废除，至少向欧洲迁移的模式发生了变化。,"With the collapse of communist states and their highly restrictive emigration policies, patterns of European migration at least have been transformed."
4434,90年代有200万苏联犹太人迁往以色列。,The 1990s have witnessed over 2 million Soviet Jews emigrate to Israel.
4435,在过去的20年里，在经合组织成员国中，有害垃圾的处理规定日渐变得严格起来，而且因遵守这些规定而付出的成本也稳步上升。,Over the last two decades the regulation of hazardous waste disposal in OECD countries has become increasingly stringent and the costs of compliance have steadily escalated.
4435,一系列国际条约已经有效禁止了有害垃圾倾倒入海，而且禁止在海洋中焚烧垃圾。,A series of international treaties have effectively banned the dumping of hazardous wastes at sea and completely phased out the sea-based incineration option.
4435,在陆上，控制垃圾焚烧的规定已经防止了许多有害垃圾被存放在不恰当的地方，这为人们提供了回收垃圾以及焚烧垃圾的选择。,"On land, regulations governing the management of landfill sites have prevented many hazardous wastes from being stored in inappropriate sites.This has left recycling and land-based incineration options."
4436,另一方面，许多跨国公司为追求价廉物美的产品（见上面第3章）而将消耗大量资源的产品向国外的中小企业转移（“分割价值链”）。,"On the other hand, many MNCs now outsource production to SMEs abroad ('slicing up the value chain') to achieve cheap high-quality production (see chapter 3 above)."
4436,在此过程中形成的全球生产网络或系统涉及的不是直接所有权，而是相当规范的契约关系。,In the process global production networks or systems are created which involve not direct ownership but rather regularized contractual relationships.
4436,但同样，一国内的中小企业可以通过特许权经营、与其他中小企业合作或者在其中进行有价证券投资等形式向国外扩展，以形成全球生产和销售链。,"But equally SMEs in one country may expand abroad through franchising, or cooperative arrangements with or portfolio investment in other SMEs to form global production and distribution chains."
4436,虽然大的跨国公司一直倾向于控制全球生产和分配系统，但现在并不一定如此。,Although big MNCs have tended to dominate global production and distribution systems this is no longer necessarily the case.
4437,通过专门的和有组织的教育，罗马的统治阶级，不论男人和女人几乎都普遍识字。,"Through specialized and organized instruction, literacy was almost universal among the Roman ruling class, men and women."
4437,帝国西部的拉丁文和东部的拉丁文与希腊文成了政治和文化上共同的官方语言。,Latin in the western half of the empire and Latin and Greek in the east formed the shared official languages of politics and culture.
4437,罗马帝国有意在各省修建剧院和圆形剧场，戏剧和诗歌在整个帝国非常普及。,Theatres and amphitheatres were deliberately built in the provinces and drama and poetry spread throughout the Empire.
4438,罗马共和国的政府机构分为三大部分。,"The government of the Roman Republic, then, consisted of three major elements."
4438,两个最高执政官和后来增选的执法官掌管着政府。,Two consuls and later other elected officials served as magistrates and ran the state.
4438,成年男性的大会（百人大会）由从最富裕公民中选出来的官员把持，而元老院则由一小部分大地主负责提出建议。,"An assembly of adult males (the centuriate assembly), controlled by the wealthiest citizens, elected these officials, while the senate, a small group of large landowners, advised them."
4438,因此，罗马政府是一个少数特权集团控制的贵族共和国。,"The Roman state, then, was an aristocratic republic controlled by a relatively small group of privileged people."
4439,尼禄（54-68)肆意剪除了那些有碍自己行动的人，包括他的母亲，也被谋杀了。,"Nero (54--68) freely eliminated people he wanted out of the way, including his own mother, whose murder he arranged."
4439,元老因为没有军队支持，也无法反抗这些过分行为。,"Without troops, the senators proved unable to oppose these excesses."
4439,然而，尼禄的骄奢淫逸激起了罗马军团的反叛。,"However, Nero’s extravagances did provoke a revolt of the Roman legions."
4439,卫兵也抛弃了他，尼禄临终时说完“多么伟大的艺术家，就这么死去了”之后就割喉自杀了。,"Abandoned by the guards, Nero chose to commit suicide by stabbing himself in the throat after uttering his final words, ""What an artist the world is losing in me."""
4439,69年，新的内战爆发，这一年因为有四个皇帝而出名。,"A new civil war erupted in 69, known as the year of the four emperors."
4439,塔西佗精确地总结了公元69年的重要意义，“元首制隐藏很深的秘密暴露出来了，似乎皇帝很可能不再出自罗马”。,"The significance of the year 69 was summed up precisely by Tacitus when he stated that ""a well-hidden secret of the principate had been revealed: it was possible, it seemed, for an emperor to be chosen outside Rome."""
4440,在现代早期，距离原材料和军事政治权力中心的远近是武器生产分布的主要决定因素。,"In the early modern period, proximity to raw materials and to centres of military and political authority were the predominant determinants of the geography of arms production."
4440,在世界各大文明中，毫无疑问武器是被大规模地生产和制造。,"Within the world's major civilizations, arms were undoubtedly produced on a significant scale."
4440,战争，征服和帝国扩张是军事技术由一个地方转移到其他地方的主要机制。,"War, conquest and empire-building were the primary mechanisms by which military technologies in one locale were transferred to others."
4441,从经济角度说，通过陆上交通大批量运输农产品和制成品——而不仅仅是小量的奢侈品——成为可能。,Bulk flows across land of agricultural and manufactured products --- rather than merely a trickle of prestige goods --- became economically feasible.
4441,政冶和军事控制能够从海岸前哨扩展到内陆国家的腹地。,Political and military control could be extended from coastal outposts into the interior of landlocked societies.
4441,帆船被蒸汽船代替，巴拿马和苏伊士运河开通，这些都大大减少了主要的远洋运输路线的距离和危险。,The shift from sail to steam along with the construction of the Panama and Suez canals combined to reduce dramatically the distance and hazards of key oceanic shipping routes.
4441,国际贸易和移民的运输成本（以及某些不确定性）大幅度减小而且规模不断增加。,The transport costs (and some of the uncertainties) of international trade and migration fell precipitously and volumes rose.
4442,另一方面，随着全球化的加强，它产生了社会——经济活动重新领土化的压力。这些活动的形式包括次国家的、区域性的、超国家的经济区，治理机制以及文化复合体。,"On the other hand, as globalization intensifies it generates pressures towards a reterritorialization of socio-economic activity in the form of subnational, regional and supranational economic zones, mechanisms of governance and cultural complexes."
4442,全球化也强化了社会的“本土化”和“国家化”。,It may also reinforce the 'localization' and 'nationalization' of societies.
4442,因此，全球化涉及到政治经济权力复杂的解领土化和再领土化。,"Accordingly, globalization involves a complex deterritorialization and reterritorialization of political and economic power."
4442,从这个角度，最好把全球化理解为“无领土的”（aterritorial）。,"In this respect, it is best described as being ""aterritorial""."
4443,伊斯兰教是一种直接的，简单的信仰，它强调遵从安拉意志的必要性。,"Islam was a direct and simple faith, emphasizing the need to obey the will of Allah."
4443,这意味着遵从一项以五功为内容的基本的伦理规范，即信仰安拉、尊穆罕默德为先知；每天例行五次标准的祈祷，每周五中午参加共同的敬拜安拉的祷告，遵守神圣的斋月（伊斯兰历法中的第九个月）的规定，从日出到日落期间禁食，若有可能要参加朝圣，即著名的麦加朝圣，一生至少去麦加朝圣一次（见附文），向穷人和不幸的人施舍。,"This meant following a basic ethical code consisting of the Five Pillars of Islam: belief in Allah and Muhammad as his Prophet; standard prayer five times a day and public prayer on Friday at midday to worship Allah; observance of the holy month of Ramadan (the ninth month on the Muslim calendar) with fasting from dawn to sunset; making a pilgrimage (known as the hajj), if possible, to Mecca at least once in one’s lifetime (see the box above); and giving alms to the poor and unfortunate."
4443,严格遵守规定的信徒能够确保获得永生。,The faithful who observed the law were guaranteed a place in an eternal paradise.
4444,占卜有多种多样的形式。,Divination took a variety of forms.
4444,至少国王和神职人员都能做的一种普通形式就是，宰杀绵羊或者山羊并检査它们的肝脏和其他器官。,"A common form, at least for kings and priests who could afford it, involved killing animals, such as sheep or goats, and examining their livers or other organs."
4444,通过被宰杀动物器官看到的征状臆测某事将要发生。,"Supposedly, features seen in the organs of the sacrificed animals foretold events to come."
4444,一本小册子这样预言，如果动物的器官呈x状，那么战斗的结局就是y。,"One handbook predicted that if the animal organ had shape x, the outcome of the military campaign would be y."
4445,“战时共产主义”政策包括对银行和大部分工业企业的国有化，从农民手中强制征收粮食，以及在布尔什维克控制下的国家管理机构的中央集权化。,"War communism included the nationalization of banks and most industries, the forcible requisition of grain from peasants, and the centralization of state administration under Bolshevik control."
4445,布尔什维克的另一个工具是“革命恐怖”，尽管旧的沙皇制的秘密警察已经被取消了，被称作契卡的新的红色秘密警察取而代之。,"Another Bolshevik instrument was “revolutionary terror.”Although the old tsarist secret police had been abolished, a new Red secret police---known as the Cheka---replaced it."
4445,由契卡来实现的红色恐怖孜孜以求的就是镇压一切反对新政权的人。,The Red Terror instituted by the Cheka aimed at nothing less than the destruction of all opponents of the new regime.
4446,前面已经讨论过，人权体制与人权法律与如下观点很难融洽相处，即：认为国家主权单独作为政治社会内部或政治社会之间的组织关系的恰当原则。,It has already been argued in the previous section that human rights regimes and human rights law sit uneasily with the idea of accepting state sovereignty alone as the proper principle for the organization of relations within and between political communities.
4446,因其在当代全球政治中的中心地位，它们已被区别对待（1.3.2部分）。,They have been treated separately (section 1.3.2) because of their centrality to contemporary global politics.
4446,但是它们能够与战争法、防止战争犯罪和反人道主义犯罪的法律以及环境法一起，被看作是世界法的组成部分。,"But they could be thought of as an element of cosmopolitan law, along with the law of war, the law governing war crimes and crimes against humanity, and environmental law."
4446,这些法的领域共同构成了一套不断发展的标准和限制，对国家主权原则不受限制的观点施加影响和进行限定。,"Together, these domains of law constitute a developing set of standards and constraints which bear upon and qualify the notion of an untrammelled principle of state sovereignty."
4447,实际上，其他国家境内的正统性原则在很大程度上受到了忽视。,"In fact, however, the principle of legitimacy was largely ignored elsewhere."
4447,在维也纳会议上，各强权都在为自己的国家抢占土地。,"At the Congress of Vienna, the great powers all grabbed land to add to their states."
4447,他们相信自己在重建欧洲的均势，从而可以避免任何一个国家控制全欧洲。,They believed that they were forming a new balance of power that would keep any one country from dominating Europe.
4448,这样的借贷大部分是通过政府债券进行的，所以欧洲的国际债券市场（特别是伦敦）扩大到全球范围（Vos，1994，第4章）。,"Since this borrowing was largely through government bonds, the European markets for international bonds (especially London) acquired a more global reach (Vos, 1994, ch. 4)."
4448,随着政府债券的国际发行和交易，这些金融工具的供需在全球市场中起到了决定性作用。,"With the international issuing and trading of government bonds, demand and supply for these financial instruments was determined increasingly in a global market."
4448,全球债券市场基本上是私人组织的，政府对交易几乎不加限制。,"The global bond market was essentially privately organized, with governments placing few if any restrictions on trading."
4449,当罗马扩张到整个地中海时，又增设了执法官负责管理新征服的省区（公元前227年增加了两名，公元前197年又增加了两名）。,"As Rome expanded into the Mediterranean, additional praetors were established to govern the newly conquered provinces (two in 227, two more in 197)."
4449,可是，随着行省数量继续增长，罗马人创建了新的体制，即最高执政官和执法官在一年任期期满后，将被任命为地方最高执政官和地方执法官，作为省督到地方赴任。,"But as the number of provinces continued to grow, the Romans devised a new system in which ex-consuls and ex-praetors who had served their one-year terms were given the title of proconsul and propraetor and sent out as provincial governors."
4449,这再次说明罗马切实解决了当时紧迫问题。,This demonstrates once again the Romans’ practical solution to an immediate problem.
4449,有理由认为，富有管理经验的官员将会胜任地方长官，虽然这并不总是正确，因为这样使各省存在着经济腐败的机会。,"It was reasonable to assume that officials with governmental experience would make good provincial administrators, although this was not always true in practice due to the opportunities for financial corruption in the provinces."
4450,在某种程度上，这种组织形式普遍存在于冶矿和农业部门，一些制造业组装企业是按照严格的生产线等级组织并跨国运行的（这种情况述可能出观在服务部门和制造业）：例如，美国跨国公司运用数据控制在中美洲和加勒比地区的生产，欧洲公司甚至在远及南亚的地方也这样做。,"Some manufacturing assembly is organized with the strict hierarchy of the production line operating at the transnational level.It may also be reflected in the services sector as well as manufacturing: for example, US firms use data inputting offices in Central America and the Caribbean, and European firms do likewise as far afield as South Asia."
4450,它还包括一些情形，跨国公司从事商品和服务的地方性生产，但保持对产品和质量的集中控制。就许多国际名牌商标和服务来说，商标（如贝纳通）被看成是世界范围内同一品质的保证。,"It also covers cases where MNCs produce a good or service locally but retain central control over production and quality; for many internationally recognized goods or services, the trademark (such as Benetton) is intended as a guarantee of consistent quality over the world."
4451,不过，极端爱国主义者即使在这一阶段也是一支重要的政治力量。,"Nevertheless, patriotic-extremism was even during this period an important political force."
4451,第一次世界大战以后的几年，农村和城市的激进主义分子经常展开暴力斗争。,The early years following World War I were a period of rural as well as urban radicalism that at times took violent forms.
4451,极端爱国主义组织破坏佃户和工人的罢工斗争；与此同时，受雇的地痞恶棍破坏工会，捣毁自由派的报纸。,"Patriotic organizations helped to break tenant and worker strikes, while hired bullies smashed labor unions and liberal newspapers."
4451,政府通过教育部发起了主要针对学生的“反危险思想”运动。,"The government too reacted with a campaign by the Ministry of Education against ""dangerous thoughts,"" directed mainly against students."
4451,在1925年4月，政府通过了治安法（比1887年的更为具体)，对那些旨在改变政府体制或私有制而参加社团者，要予以监禁。,"In April of 1925 the government passed a Peace Preservation Law (far more specific than that of 1887), punishing with imprisonment those who joined societies) aimed at altering the system of government or repudiating private property."
4451,这一法律为日本大规模监禁政策开了先例。,This law inaugurated in Japan the policy of mass incarcerations.
4452,只是近年来，日本和澳大利亚人在国际旅游中所占的份额有了很大的提高（OECD，1986)。,"It is only in recent years that the Japanese and Australians have significantly increased their shares of international travel (OECD, 1986)."
4452,较近期的数字表明，这种不均匀性一直存在。,
4452,,More recent figures suggest that this unevenness persists.
4452,1994年，只有近2.5%的国际旅游者来自非洲，1.2%来自中东，0.6%来自南亚。,"In 1994 only 2.5 per cent of international tourists came from Africa, 1.2 per cent from the Middle East and 0.6 per cent from South Asia."
4453,生产和销售网络的全球化指的是世界主要经济域内公司活动和贸易网络的延伸。,The globalization of production and distribution networks refers to the stretching of corporate activity and business networks across the world's major economic regions.
4453,其最直观和制度化的形式是巨型跨国公司组织和管理跨国商业活动，这种活动是借助于在不同国家拥有工厂、出口和附属公司来实现的。,"In its most visible and institutionalized form it involves the operations of huge MNCs organizing and managing cross-border business activity through the ownership of plants, outlets or subsidiaries in different countries."
4453,另一方面，许多跨国公司为追求价廉物美的产品（见上面第3章）而将消耗大量资源的产品向国外的中小企业转移（“分割价值链”）。,"On the other hand, many MNCs now outsource production to SMEs abroad ('slicing up the value chain') to achieve cheap high-quality production (see chapter 3 above)."
4453,在此过程中形成的全球生产网络或系统涉及的不是直接所有权，而是相当规范的契约关系。,In the process global production networks or systems are created which involve not direct ownership but rather regularized contractual relationships.
4454,这就减少了运作成本，而且使经营活动符合客户的特殊需要。,This reduces operating costs and it allows deals to be tailored to clients' specific needs.
4454,虽然它表明资本经营脱离了传统信贷，但是银行在筹划和分销债券过程中起着关键的作用。,
4454,,"While this represents a move away from traditional bank lending, banks often play a key role in arranging and underwriting these bond issues."
4454,这种交易对银行很有吸引力，因为它是“资金平衡表外的”（即不包括在银行标准资产和债务中），因此，不受国家中央银行对银行有价证券的限制的影响。,"Such business is attractive to banks because it is ""off-balance sheet"" (that is, not included in banks' standard assets and liabilities) and therefore not subject to the restrictions national central banks place on banks' portfolios."
4455,在消除了一些疑团后，我们可以得出这徉一个结论：美国南北战争是可被称之为城市或资产阶级民主革命中的最后一次攻势。,"The conclusion, reached after much uncertainty, amounts to the statement that the American Civil War was the last revolutionary offensive on the part of what one may legitimately call urban or bourgeois capitalist democracy."
4455,再次应该说明一点：种植园蓄奴制并不是工业资本主义发展的经济桎梏。,"Plantation slavery in the South, it is well to add right away, was not an economic fetter upon industrial capitalism."
4455,如果说它对工业资本主义有什么影响的话，它并未起阻碍作用，与之相反，它促进了早期工业的发展。,"If anything, the reverse may have been true; it helped to promote American industrial growth in the early stages."
4455,但是，奴隶制的存在对于政治民主和社会民主的建立，是一道障碍。,But slavery was an obstacle to a political and social democracy.
4455,这种理解不够明确。,There are ambiguities in this interpretation.
4455,有些模糊不清的理解是论据本身引起的，它们将在我后面的分析中重点谈到；有些则更加隐晦，无论拿出多少证据也无法使它变得清晰，这一点大家在本章末还可看到。,"Those that stem from the character of the evidence are best discussed as the analysis proceeds.Others lie deeper and, as I shall try to show at the end of the chapter, would not disappear no matter what evidence came to light."
4456,美国在一定程度上跨越了这些趋势。,America stands somewhat astride of these trends.
4456,从美国诞生之日起，种族划分和民族认同就是一个有争议的领域。,Ethnicity and national identity have been a contested terrain since the inception of the USA.
4456,而且，由于新的移民浪潮以及60年代出现的一浪高过一浪的公民权抗议运动，美国旧的主张社会同化的熔炉式认同模式开始被拋弃。,"Moreover, the rejection of the older assimilationist melting-pot model of American identity was initiated not by new waves of immigration but by the explosive protests of the civil rights movement in the 1960s."
4457,因此、后面各章的最后两个部分都将努力把对每个领域中全球化的形态和历史的分析与6个发达资本主义国家的命运联系在一起。,"Accordingly, the penultimate and concluding sections of subsequent chapters will seek to relate the analysis of the shape and history of globalization in each domain to the fate of the six SIACS."
4457,这将涉及到对它们卷入各领域的不同程度进行专门分析，并且检验它对国家主权和自主性的影响。,This will involve a specific exploration of their differential levels of global enmeshment in each domain and an examination of its implications for state sovereignty and autonomy.
4457,我们分析的首要目的是提供一个对当代全球化的本质和不同的政治影响更系统的理解。,The primary purpose of this analysis is to deliver a more systematic understanding of the nature and differential political consequences of contemporary globalization.
4457,出于比较的目的，也会提到其他国家，特别是发展中国家，但只在有关的情况下才这样做。,"For comparative purposes, other individual states --- particularly those with developing economies --- will be referred to and discussed only where relevant."
4458,技术差异、规模经济和生产要素相对供应的差异促进了贸易的发展。,"Trade is driven by technological differences, scale economies and differences in the relative supplies of factors of production."
4458,在古典金本位时代，存在着工资水平国际融合的趋势。,During the classical Gold Standard period there was a marked international convergence in wages.
4458,当国家间交换采用同样的技术生产不同的商品时，这种融合就导致了生产的专业化，第二次世界大战后贸易的性质己经改变了这些趋势。,Such convergence arose from increasing specialization as countries exchanged dissimilar goods produced with broadly similar technology.The nature of postwar trade has modified these trends.
4458,如前所述，第二次世界大战后大多数发达国家间的贸易都集中在相似的产品上，而这些国家的生产力水平已大体持平。,"As noted, much of the postwar trade between developed countries has been in similar products, while these countries have converged in productivity levels."
4458,这样，即便战后发达国家的工资水平有明显的趋同，这也应归功于生产力水平的均衡，而不是因为贸易（Dollar 和 Wolff，1993；Wolff，1997)。,"Thus, although there has been a marked convergence in postwar wage levels among developed countries, this has been due to the convergence in productivity levels rather than to trade (Dollar and Wolff, 1993; Wolff, 1997)."
4459,在专制主义达到顶峰的时候，其内部的矛盾与谬误也日益明显化，不求助于官位的出售，“吗哪（这是一种圣经中所说的神赐食——译者注）不会从天而降”。,At the height of absolutism the contradictions and paradoxes of the system were already visible.
4459,路易十四也许必须通过大财团来筹得资金从而获得国民的支持。,"Without resort to the sale of offices, ""the manna that never fails,"" Louis XIV would probably have had to seek the consent of the nation through the Estates General to raise money."
4459,因此，官位出售的根源在于国王对贵族的独立性，以及不受任何国会的控制。,"Hence the sale of offices was at the root of the king’s independence of the aristocracy, of any effective control by a parliament."
4459,这种独立性是王权专制主义的主要支柱。,It was the key prop of royal absolutism.
4460,虽然发展中国家的国际信贷总量在80年代大幅度下跌，90年代保持较低水平，但在70年代，它却占有世界总量的1/4〜1/3。,"During the 1970s developing countries accounted for between a quarter and a third of total international bank loans, although this declined in the 1980s, remaining low until the mid-1990s."
4460,从那时起，发展中国家的国内金融市场向国际投资者开放，这些国家和转轨经济体吸引了大量的资金流入。,"Since then domestic financial markets in developing countries have been opened up to international investors and these countries, alongside transition economies, have received significant financial inflows."
4460,最突出的是，拉丁美洲重新获得进入私人国际资本市场的权利，所以，1983〜1989年间1160亿美元的净流出变成了1990〜1994年2000亿美元的净输入。,"Most notably, Latin America has regained access to private international capital markets so that net outflows over 1983-9 of $116 billion have switched to net inflows of $200 billion over 1990-4."
4461,关于国际资本市场连续性的数据只是到了70年代才真正出现。,Consistent data on international capital markets really only commence in the 1970s.
4461,这不仅仅是一个统计上的意外事件，而且直接反映了此间国际资本市场的迅速扩张。,This is more than a statistical accident and directly reflects the huge expansion of these markets in this period.
4461,"从60年代很低的水平起，私人资本流量增长了，因此1997年新发放的国际贷款和债券净额总量已达8900亿美元，而未偿还的贷款和债券存量在1998年3月总量达76350亿美元（BIS,1998a)。","From negligible levels in the 1960s, private capital flows grew so that in 1997 the total net new issues of international loans and bonds amounted to $890 billion while stocks of outstanding loans and bonds totalled $7,635 billion in March 1998 (BIS, 1998a)."
4462,因为资本主义的扩展己经带来了经济货币化。所以今天的金融全球化已经涉及到了一个金融深化的过程。其中，世界金融市场的动力直接影响到几乎所有经济的日常运作和组织。,"As the spread of capitalism has brought with it the monetization of economies, financial globalization today has involved a process of financial deepening in that the dynamics of world financial markets reach directly into the day-to-day functioning and organization of all but a few economies."
4462,在这方面，国内利率和汇率受到全球金融市场的严重制约。,In this respect domestic interest rates and exchange rates are significantly conditioned by the operation of global financial markets.
4462,尽管资本流量在经合发国家的集中度有所下降，但是把这看作世界金融市场在全球扩张并产生全球影响则是误导性的。,"The concentration of capital flows in OECD states, though diminishing, is therefore a misleading indicator of the global reach and impact of world financial markets."
4463,对于国家主权的效力的挑战可以被另一个领域正在出现的规则进一步说明：管理环境及自然资源使用的法律。,The challenge to the efficacy of state sovereignty can be illustrated further by another arena of emerging regulation: the law governing the environment and the use of natural resources.
4463,在这一领域里，对于传统的规制领土与资源分配的原则已提出了质疑。,In this domain there has been a questioning of the traditional principles regulating the appropriation of territory and resources.
4463,"古典的威斯特伐利亚国际法的核心，即将土地、海洋和空气置于国家主权权威的控制之下被认为是合法现象，“任何拥有领土并对其成功地实施了实际的控制的主体就取得了一种合法的所有权” (参见Cassese，1996,第376〜377页）。","At the heart of classical Westphalian international law, the earth, sea and air were recognized as phenomena legitimately falling under the sovereign authority of states on the condition that ""whoever possessed a territory and exercised actual control over it successfully secured a legal title"" (see Cassese, 1986, pp. 376-7)."
4464,在御宇48 年之后，万历皇帝平静地离开了人间。他被安葬在他亲自参与设计的定陵里，安放在孝端皇后和孝靖皇后即恭妃王氏的棺椁之间。,"After reigning for forty-eight years, the Wan-li emperor died peacefully and was buried, along with his empress and Lady Wang, in the mausoleum that he himself had helped to design."
4464,他所宠爱的贵妃郑氏比他多活了10 年。,"The woman he loved, Lady Cheng, was left behind to outlive him for ten years."
4464,由于她被认定是国家的妖孽，她得不到任何人的同情。这10 年，她住在紫禁城里一座寂寞的冷宫中，和她的爱子福王永远睽离。,"Accused of every sort of intrigue and considered a curse on the empire, she was forced to spend her old age in a desolate lodge within the Forbidden City, separated forever from her beloved son, Prince Fu, cause of all the controversy."
4465,外地对初级产品出口的需求是许多富有自然资源的发展中国家增长的主要根源，也是较发达的初级品出口国如澳大利亚、加拿大、阿根廷和南非经济增长的主要原因。,"Elsewhere demand for primary exports was a major source of growth for many developing countries rich in natural resources and for the more developed primary exporters of the time, notably Australia, Canada, Argentina and South Africa."
4465,对这些国家商品的需求直接有助于经济增长，并且刺激了这些国家加工业的发展。,Demand for their goods contributed directly to growth and stimulated the development of associated processing industries.
4465,各国政府利用出口收入来进行主要的基础设施建设，这种建设通常是借助于预支未来出口收入的方式来支撑的。,"Governments used export revenues to undertake major infrastructure projects, often supplemented by borrowing abroad against future export earnings."
4466,然而，随着发达国家先行一步放开对通信业的管制，一个多国公司组成的跨国联盟出现了要求实行更自由的国际电信规制。,"However, as deregulation of the communications sectors in advanced economies has proceeded apace, a transnational coalition of multinational corporations has emerged to press for a more liberal international telecommunications regime."
4466,由于依赖廉价的通信服务的国际金融和银行利益集团的支持，要求进一步背离平等的决策程序，追求一个更为自由化的全球通信市场的压力也非常大。,"Backed also by a transnational community of finance and banking interests, which are reliant on cheap communications, the pressures for liberalization of the global communications market-to move further away from equity in decision-making-remain intense."
4466,1998年2月5日生效的世界贸易组织关于基础电信业国际服务的贸易自由化协议将这一压力推向高峰，作了最为清楚的表达。,These pressures reached their clearest expression in the run-up to the WTO agreement to liberalize international trade in basic telecommunications services which came into effect on 5 February 1998.
4467,这种自由贸易制度的一个影响在于它使武器在国际体系中扩散到更大范围。,One of the consequences of this free trade regime was that arms were diffused ever more widely throughout the interstate system.
4467,帝国的征服以及日益发展的全国贸易和通信基础设施，增进了私营武器制造商全球性出口的前景。,"Imperial conquest, combined with an increasingly well-developed global trade and communication infrastructure, enhanced the global export prospects of private arms manufacturers."
4467,结果，南美、亚洲、远东和非洲的市场都越来越与欧洲的武器出口商接轨。,"As a result, markets in South America, Asia, the Near East and Africa became increasingly accessible to European arms exporters."
4468,而且，现代民族国家获得了一种特殊的政治形式——它的主要变量具体化为自由民主或代议制民主。,"Moreover, the modern nation-state has acquired a particular political form---its main variant has crystallized as liberal or representative democracy."
4468,自由民主当然意味着影响一个共同体的决定是由该共同体中一小部分代表产生的，这些代表通过法律上的选举程序被挑选出来，即合法化，并在法治框架的基础上实施管理。,"Liberal democracy means, of course, that decisions affecting a community are taken by a subgroup of representatives who have been chosen, that is legitimated, through the electoral process to govern within the framework of the rule of law."
4468,在国家政治的竞技场上，自由民主是以一大堆规则和制度的存在为显著特征的，这些规则和制度是自由民主成功运转必不可少的条件。,"In the arena of national politics, liberal democracy is distinguished by the presence of a cluster of rules and institutions all of which are necessary to its successful functioning; without any of these, liberal democracy cannot be fully realized."
4469,到处都是梅特涅的密探，搜寻着自由主义者或民族主义者密谋的证据。,"Metternich’s spies were everywhere, searching for evidence of liberal or nationalist plots."
4469,梅特涅在1815年有点担心过度了。,Metternich worried too much in 1815.
4469,尽管自由主义和民族主义都在徳意志诸邦国和奥地利帝国出现了，但由于中欧还是倾向于接受土地贵族阶级和专制的、中央集权化的君主的统治，两种意识形态在起初都还很弱小。,"Although both liberalism and nationalism emerged in the German states and the Austrian Empire, they were initially weak as central Europe tended to remain under the domination of aristocratic landowning classes and autocratic, centralized monarchies."
4470,在女真族建立的金朝，与中国古代历代王朝一样，宗室作为统治者的血亲成员会享受到诸多优厚的经济待遇。,"In the Chin Dynasty, similar to other cases of Chinese dynasties, the royal clans who were the kin of the emperors, had a variety of economic privileges."
4470,宗室成员因此大多过上了富裕的生活，但也有部分宗亲的生活由于种种原因并不富足。,"Taking advantage of these economic privileges provided by the state, most royal clans lived an affluent life.However, some royal clan's life was still difficult as a result of some reasons."
4470,出于追求财富的天性，宗室成员中也常有经济犯罪行为发生。,"Due to the human nature of pursuing wealth, some people of the royal clans might also commit crimes for economic benefits."
4470,金朝宗室阶层后期，汉化程度加深，生活奢靡，其对财富的追求和渴望加深也应该看做是金朝走向覆灭的原因之一。,"In the later stage of the Chin Dynasty, as the sinicization of royal clans went deep, they pursued an even more luxurious life, which should also be regarded as one of the factors that resulted in the downfall of their country."
4471,这种奇特的历史渊源所产生的两个主要思想构成了《社会发展纲要》的中心原则。,"This bizarre parentage has produced two main ideas that constitute the central doctrines of the ""Community Development Program""."
4471,其一是印度农民会渴望经济进步，一旦他们感受到了经济进步的好处，他们就会靠自己的努力去发展经济。,One is that India’s peasants will want economic progress and sustain it through their own efforts as soon as they have been shown its advantages.
4471,第二个原则是，变化必须而且必将随民主方式而来，也就是说，新的变化将切实地反映农民的要求，农民将通过某种方式参与规划更好的生活。,"The other theme is that the changes must and will come about democratically, that is, in response to the ""felt needs"" —a favorite phrase - of India’s villagers, who will somehow be able to participate in the planning of a better life for all."
4472,与《世界人权宣言》 及其以后的《联合国权利公约》相比， 《欧洲公约》关注的关注点不同。正如其前言所指出的，“采取首要的步骤以共同实施《世界人权宣言》（所阐述的某些权利）”。,"In marked contrast to the ""Universal Declaration of Human Rights"" and the subsequent UN Covenants on Rights, the European Convention was concerned, as its preamble states, ‘to take the first steps for the collective enforcement of certain of the rights stated in the Universal Declaration’."
4472,欧洲这一创举从建立之初至今仍然是最彻底的立法创新：抵制国家历史的潮流，允许公民个人采取行动反对他们自己的政府。,"The European initiative was and remains a most radical legal innovation: an innovation which, against the stream of state history, allows individual citizens to initiate proceedings against their own governments."
4472,在这一框架里，国家不能再随意地对待它们自己的公民（Capotorti，1983，第977页）。,"Within this framework, states are no longer free to treat their own citizens as they think fit (Capotorti, 1983, p. 977)."
4473,第三，近年来，由于技术和规范的变迁，这些转变正在逐渐加快。,"Third, these shifts have been accelerated in recent years by technological and regulatory changes."
4473,最重要的技术变化就是卫星和有线电视的出现。,The most important technological shifts have been the advent of satellite and cable television.
4473,例如，在欧洲，如果将有线电视和卫星算在内，1988〜1993年这5年的时间内，其频道的数量已经从104个增加到165个，而在欧盟国家范围内，其频道数量从77个增加到129个（IDATE，1993，第39页）。,"When cable and satellite are included, the number of channels in Europe, for example, increased in the five years from 1988 to 1993 from 104 to 165 and within the EU from 77 to 129 (IDATE, 1993, p. 39)."
4473,在1997年，欧洲电视广播的频道总数量已增加到250多个（《银屏摘要》，1997a）。,"In 1997, the total number of channels broadcasting in Europe had risen to over 250 (Screen Digest, 1997a)."
4474,最后，土地贵族也无须镇压农民，他们的目的无非是农民在进入商品化农业的过程中不要碍手碍脚。总之，经济手段足以提供他们所需要的劳动力。,"Finally, the landed upper classes themselves did not need to repress the peasants.Mainly they wanted to get them out of the way in order to go over to commercial farming; by and large, economic measures would be enough to provide the labor force they needed."
4474,这种特殊形式的经济成功，使他们几乎没有必要借助强制手段延续其统治地位。,"Succeeding economically in this particular fashion, they had little need to resort to repressive political measures to continue their leadership."
4474,因此，英国的制造业和农业利益在19世纪的其余时间里为争取公众支持展开角逐，双方分庭抗礼，以种种自私自利的措施彼此攻击，互争短长（如1832年改革法、废除谷物法、乡绅支持工厂立法等等）,"Therefore in England manufacturing and agrarian interests competed with one another for popular favor during the rest of the nineteenth century, gradually extending the suffrage while jealously opposing and knocking down each other’s more selfish measures (Reform Bill of 1832, abolition of the Corn Laws in 1846, gentry support for factory legislation, etc)."
4475,在政治方面，起义的结果是使立法议会（它在1791年10月代替了制宪议会）实际上放弃了它的职权，并废黜了国王（这一点到1792年底才真正做到）。,"In national politics the consequence was the virtual abdication of the Legislative Assembly, which had replaced the Constituent Assembly in October 1791; the trial of Louis XVI, which did not take place until the end of 1792; and, more immediately, popular vengeance in the September 1792 massacres."
4475,更为直接的是，起义带来了1792年9月大屠杀时期的普遍报复，这些屠杀似乎是作为一种自发的民众活动而开始的。,These massacres appear to have started about as spontaneously as mass actions ever do.
4475,大群的市民抓住并处决了在警察押护下的犯人。,A waiting crowd seized and summarily executed a batch of prisoners under escort.
4475,后来屠杀又扩展至监狱，大约有1100至1400人丧生，其中绝大部分是普通的盗贼、妓女、伪造犯和游民。,"Then the massacres spread to the jails.Between 1100 and 1400 lost their lives, the great majority common thieves, prostitutes, forgers, and vagrants."
4475,大约仅有1/4的被杀者是牧师、贵族或各种各样的“政治犯”。,"Only about a quarter were priests, nobles, or ""politicals"" of any sort."
4475,类似的情形在法国其他城市和集镇中也出现了。,Similar scenes took place in other French cities and towns.
4475,这种屠杀的意义在于，它显示了一种盲目的非理性的普遍报复行为，而下一阶段将要出现的恐怖行动（上述拫复行为不过是它的一个序幕）则变得更有组织，其结果也更为确定了。,"The massacres are significant mainly as revealing the blindness and irrationality of popular vengeance.The Terror, of which they were a prelude and which appeared in the next phase, was more organized and less capricious in its results."
4476,还有许多规模较小的商业企业愿意出口军事生产技术或把民用技术用于军事方面。,There were also a host of other smaller commercial concerns willing to export military production technology or civil technologies with military applications.
4476,20世纪初，俄国在一些重要的欧洲武器生产制造商的直接帮助下实现了军事生产能力的现代化（Krause，1992，第66页）。,"Russia modernized its military production capability at the turn of the century with the direct assistance of the major European arms producers (Krause, 1992, p. 66)."
4476,日本、中国、意大利、奥匈帝国、奥斯曼帝国、西班牙和拉丁美洲一些新独立的国家也都从国外进口军事技术，并将其作为实现经济现代化的一个战略（Mc.Neill，1982；Krause，1992）。,"Likewise Japan, China, Italy, Austro-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, Spain and newly independent nations in Latin America imported foreign military technology as part of a strategy of economic modernization (McNeill, 1982; Krause, 1992)."
4477,早期罗马社会构成最显著的是划分成贵族与平民两大阶级。,The most noticeable element in the social organization of early Rome was the division between two groups--the patricians and the plebeians.
4477,罗马贵族由王政时代委任的最早元老的后代家族组成。,The patrician class in Rome consisted of families who were descended from the original senators appointed during the period of the kings.
4477,他们最初的政治优势地位可能源于他们作为大地主拥有财富。,Their initial prominence was probably due to their wealth as great landowners.
4477,这样贵族就构成了贵族统治集团。,Thus patricians constituted an aristocratic governing class.
4477,只有他们才能当选最高执政官、执法官和元老。,"Only they could be consuls, other magistrates, and senators."
4477,因为蓄养大量的门客，他们控制了百人大会以及罗马社会的诸多方面。,"Through their patronage of large numbers of dependent clients, they could control the centuriate assembly and many other facets of Roman life."
4478,控制反人道的战争和犯罪的规则体系主要针对的是战争中反人民的暴力犯罪。,The rule systems governing warfare and crimes against humanity are mainly concerned with the perpetration of violence against people during war.
4478,但是，许多针对个人的暴力迫害的形式以及许多权力滥用的形式并非发生在公开的战争行为之中。,"However, many forms of violence perpetrated against individuals, and many forms of abuse of power, do not take place during declared acts of war."
4478,事实上，最近已认为，战争与和平之间的区别，以及压迫与反抗之间的区別，已被变化的暴力模式消蚀了（Kaldor，1998）。,"In fact, it has recently been argued that the distinctions between war and peace, and between aggression and repression, are eroded by changing patterns of violence (Kaldor, 1998)."
4479,很明显，这6个国家在过去的50年里都已改变了其卷入全球政治的状态和形式。,It is readily apparent that the enmeshment of each of the six countries in global politics has changed shape and form over the last five decades.
4479,尽管各国在战争刚刚结束时有很大的差异，但事实上，它们都已废弃了以前的殖民协定，其中4个是北约的成员，瑞典最近加入了一个与北约相关的组织——“和平伙伴关系”。,"While each of the countries began life very differently in the immediate postwar years, they have practically all shed their previous colonial commitments, four are members of NATO and Sweden recently joined a linked NATO programme, the Partnership for Peace."
4479,另外，有4个国家现在是欧盟的成员，所有的国家都是国家与全球政治的主要行动者——尽管其对政府间组织和国际非政府组织的参与程度不同。,"In addition, four countries are now members of the European Union, and all are major players - albeit with somewhat different levels of enmeshment in IGOs and INGOs - in international and global politics."
4480,北美自由贸易区是在美国、加拿大和墨西哥之间建立的自由贸易区，它没有对其他地区釆用保护政策。亚太经合组织或东盟也是如此（Petri，1983）。,"NAFTA is a free trade area between the USA, Canada and Mexico, and has not increased protection against the rest of the world; nor has APEC or ASEAN (Petri, 1993)."
4480,事实表明，贸易区域化是区域间贸易的补充，或与区域间贸易并驾齐驱。,"The evidence suggests that trade regionalization is complementary to, and has grown alongside, interregional trade."
4481,许多德国人和西方人对南朝鲜会落入北朝鲜的共产主义力量的控制之下的忧虑，使他们担心西德本身的安全，这就使许多人提出要重新武装西徳。,The fear that South Korea might fall to the Communist forces of the North led many Germans and Westerners to worry about the security of West Germany and led to calls for the rearmament of West Germany.
4481,尽管很多人都担心德国军国主义复活，谴责了这种提议，但冷战的压力是决定性的。,"Although many people, concerned about a revival of German militarism, condemned this proposal, Cold War tensions were decisive."
4481,1955年，西德重新武装起来，成为北约的一员。,West Germany rearmed in 1955 and became a member of NATO.
4482,全球化也强化了社会的“本土化”和“国家化”。,"It may also reinforce the ""localization"" and ""nationalization"" of societies."
4482,因此，全球化涉及到政治经济权力复杂的解领土化和再领土化。,"Accordingly, globalization involves a complex deterritorialization and reterritorialization of political and economic power."
4482,从这个角度，最好把全球化理解为“无领土的”。,"In this respect, it is best described as being aterritorial."
4483,在发展中国家，这种影响可能会大些。非关税壁垒对发展中国家贸易影响很大，原因是这些国家在农业、纺织和其他几个工业部门具有比较优势（Page，1994，第3章）。,"They are probably higher in developing countries and have a greater impact on their trade since they are particularly prevalent in agricultural, textiles and several other industrial sectors in which many developing countries have a comparative advantage (Page, 1994, ch. 3)."
4483,再者，受非贸易壁垒影响的产品只占发展中国家出口的一小部分。乌拉圭回合谈判的一个结果就是这些壁垒已经削减，特别是逐渐结束限制纺织品贸易的多种纤维协议。,"Again, they appear to cover only a minority of the exports of developing countries and some of these barriers have been reduced as a result of the Uruguay Round, notably with the phasing out of the Multi-fibre Agreement which limits textiles trade."
4484,在西欧，战后早期的迁移通常是区域性的。,"In Western Europe, early postwar migration was often regional in its scope."
4484,欧洲国家后来才卷入到范围更加广泛的迁移中。,European countries then became enmeshed in more extensive migrations.
4484,在20世纪50年代和60年代，比利时、法国、德国和瑞士开始积极雇佣海外劳工，首先吸收的是南欧外围围家的移民，然后逐渐扩展深入到土耳其和北非。,"In the 1950s and 1960s, Belgium, France, Germany and Switzerland began active programmes of overseas labour recruitment, drawing first on the Southern European periphery before extending their reach to Turkey and North Africa."
4485,资本主义的出现是划时代的。,The emergence of capitalism was epoch making.
4485,它不仅影响了经济，还影响了人们生活的方方面面。,It affected not merely the economic but all aspects of life.
4485,尽管货币在中世纪还处于边缘，很少使用，但到中世纪晚期它已经为欧洲日后流星般的崛起提供了能量。,"Whereas in the early Middle Ages money had been peripheral and little used, by the late Middle Ages it provided energy that was responsible for Europe's future meteoric rise."
4485,在此前的社会和经济体制中，没有一个是建立在成长的观念上的——它们的目的只是保持、而不是提高过去物质生活的水平——但是资本主义却恰恰与之相反。,No earlier societies or economic systems had been based on the notion of growth.Their aim had been only to maintain the material well-being of the past rather than to enhance it.
4486,然而，这是一个制度化的体制，其中国际货币基金组织监督着国际金融秩序的规则应用。,"It was, however, an institutionalized system in that the IMF policed the rules of the international financial order."
4486,国际货币基金组织监督着该体制的运作，监控着国家的经济运行，并准备预防措施以“拯救”存在收支平衡困难的国家。,"The IMF oversaw the operation of the system, monitoring countries, economic performance and providing reserve facilities to ‘bail out' countries that experienced balance of payments difficulties."
4486,为防止两次世界大战之间毁灭性的贬值竞争，面临短期收支赤字的国家可以自动获得贷款，数额等于它参加基金组织时获得的成员配额（根据它们缴纳的资金规定）。,"To prevent the disastrous competitive devaluations of the interwar period, countries facing a short-term balance of payments deficit could draw automatically on a loan equivalent to their initial membership quota (fixed in relation to their IMF subscription)."
4487,这造成了一种非常严重的安全困境：各国竭力通过增加或改进它们的军事能力追求它们自己的安全，这“将很容易威胁到其他国家对权力和安全的渴望”（Buzan 1991；也可参见本书1.2和1.3部分）。,"This creates a severe security dilemma in that through simply pursuing their own security, by adding to or improving their military capability, states 'can easily threaten the power and security aspirations of other states' (Buzan, 1991; and see sections 1.2 and 1.3 above)."
4487,由于潜在竞争对手都通以相同的行为方式作出反应，其结果是造成国际不安全的螺旋式上升。,The consequence is a spiral of international insecurity as potential rivals respond in a like manner.
4487,因此，在一个无政府的国际体系中，国家安全永远无法从全球的系统环境中完全脱离出来。问题：搭配不当，建议增译。“不安全”此处作为一个名词与“上升”搭配不当。改1：其结果是不安全感的螺旋式上升。,"Accordingly, national security, in an anarchic interstate system, can never be disentangled entirely from global systemic conditions."
4488,列宁认为士兵、工人和农民苏维埃是现成的权力工具。,"Lenin maintained that the soviets of soldiers, workers, and peasants were ready-made instruments of power."
4488,布尔什维克必须努力控制这些团体，然后运用它们来推翻临时政府。,The Bolsheviks must work toward gaining control of these groups and then use them to overthrow the provisional government.
4488,同时，布尔什维克清晰地表达了人民的不满和愿望，保证要结束战争，为所有的农民重分土地，将工厂从资本家手中转移到工人委员会手中，并将政府权力从临时政府手中剥夺掉，使其转归苏维埃。,"At the same time, the Bolsheviks articulated the discontent and aspirations of the people, promising an end to the war, redistribution of all land to the peasants, the transfer of factories and industries from capitalists to committees of workers, and the relegation of government power from the provisional government to the soviets."
4488,三条简明的口号总结出布尔什维克的计划：“和平、土地、面包”，“工人控制生产”和“一切权力归苏维埃”。,"Three simple slogans summed up the Bolshevik program: “Peace, Land, Bread,” “Worker Control of Production,” and “All Power to the Soviets.”"
4489,随着冷战的到来，以原子弹和其他大规模杀伤性武器等为对象的裁军计划获得新的动力。,With the onset of the Cold War a new impetus for disarmament arose in the form of the atomic bomb and other weapons of mass destruction.
4489,结果，战后进行了最持久、最频繁的也是挫折最多的多边军备控制谈判（不仅包括大面积杀伤性武器，还包括常规武器）。,"As a result, the postwar period has witnessed the most sustained, intensive - as well as frustrated - attempts at multilateral control not just of weapons of mass destruction, but of conventional arms too."
4489,军备控制成为国际政治的一个永久性特征。,Arms control has become a permanent feature of international politics.
4489,世界各大国都设有军备控制和裁军机构来管理这一连续的外交过程，设在日内瓦的联合国裁军大会也保证军备控制问题一直处在全球安全议程的核心地位。,"Agencies for arms control and disarmament (or sections within foreign ministries) exist within all the worlds major states, managing what has become a continuous diplomatic process.A permanent UN Disarmament Conference in Geneva also ensures that arms control issues are kept high on the global security agenda."
4490,一个原因是，各省统治者太喜欢优美的京都，往往将他们的权力和职责授予地方部属。,"One reason for this was the tendency of provincial governors, who were too fond of the pleasures of Kyoto, to delegate their powers and responsibilities to local subordinates."
4490,另一原因是，有势力的地方家族和佛教团体对土地总是垂涎欲滴，经常用武力强占土地。只要免税制度继续存在，他们就想开垦荒地。,Another was that powerful local families and Buddhist communities were always hungry for land and often able to seize it by force.
4490,这些倾向使纳税土地的数量减少，意味着拥有耕地的农民的捐税负担增加；于是这些农民或是逃亡北部边境地区，用武力赶走住居在那里的虾夷人，或是将自己连同土地一起交托给拥有采邑的贵族。,"These trends reduced the amount of taxpaying land, which meant an increased tax load for the peasant owner-cultivators.The latter in turn either fled to the northern frontier areas where the Ainu were being pushed back by force of arms, or else they commended themselves and their lands to lords of manors."
4491,最后，封臣在下列情况下有提供帮助或者资助的义务：领主的长子行骑士礼、领主的长女出嫁以及一旦领主被俘后将他赎出等。相应地，领主对封臣也承担职责。,"Finally, vassals were also responsible for aids, or financial payments to the lord on a number of occasions, including the knighting of the lord’s eldest son, the marriage of his eldest daughter, and the ransom of the lord’s person in the event he was captured."
4491,他的主要义务是军事上保护他不受侵害，或者在法庭上给与必要的支持。,
4491,领主通常通过授给采邑的方式解决封臣的日常开支。,
4491,问题：原文信息漏译改1：最后，封臣在下列情况下有提供帮助或者资助的义务：领主的长子行骑士礼、领主的长女出嫁以及一旦领主被俘后将他赎出等。,
4491,相应地，领主对封臣也承担职责。,"In turn, a lord had responsibilities toward his vassals."
4491,他的主要义务是军事上保护他不受侵害，或者在法庭上给与必要的支持。,"His major obligation was to protect his vassal, either by defending him militarily or by taking his side in a court of law if necessary."
4491,领主也有义务通过授给采邑的方式解决封臣的日常开支。,"The lord was also responsible for the maintenance of the vassal, usually by granting him a fief."
4492,定期贸易需要制度化结构来保障交易中的产权。,Regular trade needs institutional structures to secure property rights in exchange.
4492,货物集散港口是传统上组织贸易的商人团体的基地。,Entrepot ports were home to merchant communities which traditionally organized trade.
4492,商人们对当前和未来的货场状况作详细的判断，以在各地区间调剂货物的价格。,"Merchants made sophisticated judgements about current and future market conditions, leading to some convergence in the prices of commodities between areas."
4493,但是正义战争的教义对于世俗权的影响非常有限，而且它经常被用于使欧洲的内部征服和外部征服合法化。,But the just war doctrine - jus ad bellum - had only limited impact on secular powers and was used to legitimize both intra-European and extra-European conquest.
4493,这部分是因为国家仍只是一个空壳，那时没有常备军，而且战争的行为主要是一种私人的事务。,"In part this was because states were still rather hollow shells, there were no standing armies and the conduct of war was a largely private affair."
4493,正式的外交体系的发展以及国家垄断的巩固为更加全面和系统管制战争行为的尝试提供了制度基础。,The development of formal systems of diplomacy and the consolidation of the states' monopoly over the means of violence provided the institutional infrastructure for more comprehensive and systematic attempts to regulate the conduct of war.
4494,古典希腊的宗教是城邦生活的一个组成部分，渗透到城邦生活的每一方面。,Religion in classical Greece was an integral part of polis life and accordingly affected every aspect of that life.
4494,它解释了物质世界、日常献祭活动和各种社会制度，也是激起诗人和艺术家创作灵感的一个主要源泉。,"Religion offered an interpretation of the natural world, a consecration of daily work and of social institutions, and was also one of the chief sources of inspiration for poets and artists."
4494,每一座希腊庙宇都是地方文化和民族文化的中心。,Every Greek temple was a focus of local and national culture.
4495,对于所有的民族或共同体来说，它们经历的全球相互联系程度不同，而且方式也不同。,So too is the association of globalization with 'universalism' for clearly the global is not a synonym for the universal; global interconnectedness is not experienced by all peoples or communities to the same extent or even in the same way.
4495,从这个角度也要把全球化与趋同区别开来，为全球化不认为同质化和和谐不断增强。,"In this respect, it is also to be distinguished from convergence since it does not presume growing homogeneity or harmony."
4495,相反，正如布尔和布赞两人所说，相互联系的不断加强既是强烈冲突（而不是合作）的根源，也是共同忧虑和深刻敌意的结果（Bull，1977; Buzan，1991）。,"On the contrary, as both Bull and Buzan have argued, growing interconnectedness may be both a source of intense conflict (rather than cooperation) as well as a product of shared fears and deeply held animosities (Bull, 1977; Buzan, 1991)."
4496,随着苏联的解体，美国现在正如它在战后初期那样主导着武器供应业。,"With the demise of the Soviet Union the US now dominates, as in the immediate postwar period, the arms supply business."
4496,即使如此，现在与1945年时相比武器供应国更多了。随着世界大多数地区军事开支的减少，它们对武器出口的竞争也就更为激烈。,"Even so, many more arms suppliers exist today than in 1945 and with defence expenditures in most parts of the world in decline the competition for arms exports is intense."
4497,18世纪欧洲纺织品生产的一个重要组成部分就是村舍工业，这是一种真正的家庭企业。,"One important source of textile production in the eighteenth century was the cottage industry, truly a family enterprise."
4497,图中显示的是一个家庭正在生产毛织品。,Shown here is a family at work producing knitwear.
4497,村舍工业中的一个惯例就是妇女纺纱并将其缠起来，男人则在织机上将纱织成布。,It was customary in the cottage industry for women to spin and wind the yarn and for men to weave the yarn into cloth on looms.
4498,当代迁移开始于第二次世界大战结束之时，第二次世界大战的结束导致了大规模人口流动（参看上面6.,"The contemporary era of migration begins with the end of the Second World War, which induced massive population displacements (see section 6."
4498,2.7节）。,2.7 above).
4498,要勾画战后迁移相互交叉的地理范围以及时间进度是非常复杂的。,Charting the overlapping geographies and time-scales of the postwar migrations that followed is complex.
4498,从强度和地理范围的广度方面来说，最重要的迁移流就是在西欧、大洋洲和北美的经合组织成员国的经济移民。,"In terms of intensity and geographical extensity, the most significant flows have been the economic migrations to OECD countries, in Western Europe, Oceania and North America."
4498,然而，这些迁移的性质并不都是一致的。,"However, these migrations were not all of a piece."
4499,世界范围的通信网络不仅在陆地上空，而且在海底下建立起来。,Worldwide communications networks were installed both over land and under the sea.
4499,到1900年，在世界各大洋大约铺设1.9万英里的海底电缆。英帝国所有的地区都可以直接同其在伦敦的军事指挥所取得联系 （Headrick，第162页）。,"By 1900 some 19,000 miles of underwater cable had been laid across the world's oceans and the entire British Empire was connected directly to its military command posts in London (Headrick, 1981, p. 162)."
4500,各种各样的定量指标可以用来帮助勾画军事全球化的时空和组织维度。,Various quantitative indicators may be utilized to help map the spatio-temporal and organizational dimensions of military globalization.
4500,它们包括帝国的扩张范围、外国的军事存在、军事外交代表、军火贸易、军火支出、国防开支、联盟成员数量、军事合作协议、国防工业的联系、军事干预的发生率以及军事援助的模式。,These include the reach of imperial expansion; foreign military presence; military diplomatic representation; the arms trade; arms expenditure; defence expenditure; alliance membership; military cooperation agreements; defence industrial linkages; the incidence of military intervention; and patterns of military assistance.
4500,,Indicators such as these make it feasible to track significant shifts in historical forms of military globalization and national profiles of enmeshment in the world military order.
4500,这样一个系统的评估能够对军事全球化的历史形式和历史上的世界军事秩序进行更加全面的勾画和描写。,Such a systematic appraisal holds out the prospect of a more comprehensive mapping and representation of both historical forms of military globalization and historical world military orders.
4501,这种体制的时间边界是模糊的。,The historical boundaries of such systems are often somewhat blurred.
4501,往大处估计，德国这一时期自斯担因改革至第一次世界大战终结；在日本，则从德川幕府垮台到1918年。,"At a rather generous estimate, one might hold that to this species belong the period from the Stein-Hardenberg reforms in Germany to the end of the First World War and, in Japan, from the fall of the Tokugawa Shogunate to 1918."
4501,这类专制政府常赋有某种民主色彩，主要体现在拥有一个权力有限的议会。,These authoritarian governments acquired some democratic features: notably a parliament with limited powers.
4502,在19世纪70年代，德国的贸易制度是世界上最自由的制度之一。,In the 1870s Germany had one of the most liberal trade regimes in the world.
4502,到了80年代，这种情况发生了变化。国内生产总值中的贸易份额下降了，并导致了贸易程度降低，如图3-1和图3-2所揭示的那样。,"This was reversed in the 1880s and trade as a share of GDP fell, leading to declining trade levels, as figures 3.1 and 3.2 reveal."
4502,随着出口增长，19世纪90年代又恢复了原状，其原因不仅是德国工业的发展，而且还因为鼓励出口的激励政策。,"These recovered from the 1890s with rising exports, not simply because of the development of German industry but also because of aggressive export promotion policies."
4503,另一方面，这些问题引起大部分有教养市民的热烈争论。,"On the other hand, all these questions very definitely agitated a large portion of educated townsfolk."
4503,贵族正试图通过等级会议来接管国家政权。,"The nobility was trying - to take over the state through the mechanism of the Estates General, a natural continuation of what they had been trying to do during the so-called feudal reaction."
4503,他们在这些问题上的勉强妥协使第三等级统一了政治思想，而第三等级本来不过是一种法律标志，用来指郡些既非僧侣又非贵族的阶层。,Their reluctance to compromise on these issues made for the moment what was no more than a legal label for all that was neither noble nor clergy -the Tiers Etat -into something resembling a single political mind.
4504,就其在不同地点的人们之间交换商品和服务这一意义而言，贸易已有很长的历史。,Trade in the sense of the exchange of goods and services between people over distance has a long history.
4504,在正常的长距离旅行成为可能以后，庞大的贸易帝国呈周期性地诞生。,Great trading empires have arisen periodically ever since regular long-distance travel became possible.
4504,但是，国际贸易，即在国家间交换商品和服务，实际上是伴随着民族国家的建立出现的。,"But international trade, the exchange of goods and services between nations, by definition only emerged with the establishment of the nation-state."
4505,从第二次世界大战开始，现代民族国家成为全球政治统治的主要类型。,Since the Second World War the modern nation-state has become the principal type of political rule across the globe.
4505,随着非殖民地化运动的开展和苏联帝国的瓦解，民族国家的数目急剧增长。,"With decolonization and the collapse of the Soviet empire the number of nation-states has grown rapidly (see figure 1.1 below, p. 54)."
4505,而且，现代民族国家获得了一种特殊的政治形式，它的主要变量具体化为自由民主或代议制民主。,"Moreover, the modern nation-state has acquired a particular political form - its main variant has crystallized as liberal or representative democracy."
4505,自由民主意味着影响一个共同体的决定是由该共同体中一小部分代表产生的，这些代表通过法律上的选举程序被挑选出来，即合法化，并在法治框架的基础上实施管理。,"Liberal democracy means, of course, that decisions affecting a community are taken by a subgroup of representatives who have been chosen, that is legitimated, through the electoral process to govern within the framework of the rule of law."
4506,冷战构建了一个独特的全球权力关系体系。它一方面将全球分裂为对抗的集团，而另一方面又在一个战略上相互联系的世界军事秩序中将其统一起来。,"The Cold War constituted a unique system of global power relations which, paradoxically, both divided the globe into rival camps and yet unified it within a strategically interconnected world military order."
4506,它包括广阔的、高度密集的区域性和全球性的军事权力网以及庞大的军事基地，至少对于超级大国来讲，这可使它对世界上的几乎任何一个地点发动史无前例的毁灭性打击。,"It involved extensive and intensive regional and global networks of military power and, for the superpowers at least, enormous military infrastructures to project unparalleled destructive power to almost any single site on the world's surface."
4506,这种权力关系体系也被高度地制度化和分层化（分为第一世界、第二世界和第三世界）（参看地图2-3）。,"It was also highly institutionalized and stratified (into the First World, Second World and Third World) (see map 2.3)."
4507,有趣的是，全球通信网络自身是跨国活动中管制最严格的一个部门。,"Interestingly, the global network itself is one of the most highly regulated sectors of transnational activity."
4507,它受到国际电信规制体制的管理。这一规制体制包括国际电信同盟（它包括一个无线电通信部分，世界无线电通信联盟和国际卫星组织）以及各种各样的地区性组织（见专栏1-2）。,"It is governed by the international telecommunications regime, embracing the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) (which in turn embraces a Radiocommunication Sector, the World Radiocommunication Conferences and the International Satellite Organization) and various regional organizations (see box 1.2)."
4508,80年代，日本电子工业巨擘实际上增加了海外投资。例如，在欧洲和北美寻求对外直接投资，随着日元升值和国内劳动力成本上升开始在东亚大规模投资生产。,"In the 1980s Japanese electronics giants substantially increased their overseas investment, with market-seeking FDI in Europe and North America and more extensive production in East Asia in the wake of the yen appreciation and rising labour costs at home."
4508,结果，整个亚洲形成了有等级的生产组织。,As a consequence a hierarchy of production organization has developed across Asia.
4508,多数劳动密集型生产过程从先进工业国，特别是韩国迁至欠发达国家，如中国。,"The most labour-intensive production processes have migrated from the leading economies, notably Korea, to less advanced economies, including China."
4509,结果，俄国政府只得在明知道德国会将其行为视作对德战争的情况下，于7月29日对俄国军队进行全面动员。,"Consequently, the Russian government ordered full mobilization of the Russian army on July 29, knowing that the Germans would consider this an act of war against them."
4509,德国立即做出反应，向俄国发出最后通牒，要求俄国必须在12小时内停止动员。,Germany responded to Russian mobilization with its own ultimatum that the Russians must halt their mobilization within twelve hours.
4509,俄国不予理睬，德国随即于8月1日对俄宣战。,"When the Russians ignored it, Germany declared war on Russia on August 1."
4510,杜尔哥成了这些力量的代言人。,Turgot served as a spokesmanfor these forces.
4510,他在任职期间，信奉开明专制主义，主张自由生产并使工业和农业发生了变化。,"He took office, a firm believer in enlightened despotism and in liberty of production and exchange in both industry and agriculture."
4510,传统看法认为资本主义是一种建立在私人财产和竞争基础之上而无需前资本主义制度的支持力量。只要注意一下他所试图进行的那些改革以及这些改革所引起的反对，就能够帮助我们估计到传统的看法所没有看到的资本主义背后的力量。,"A glance at his attempted reforms and the opposition they aroused helps us to gauge the strength of the forces behind a classical version of capitalism, that is, one based on private property and free competition without support from precapitalist institutions."
4511,虽然从武器供应国和购买国方面来看，冷战后的时代趋势更加多元化，但是整个体系仍然存在明显的等级。,"Although the trend over the postwar era has been towards greater diversity in terms of suppliers and purchasers, the system remains distinctly hierarchical."
4511,从这个方面看，武器供应市场变得越来越不集中（Laurance， 1992）。,"In this respect, the supplier market has become less concentrated(Laurance, 1992)."
4511,但尽管这样，最顶端的6个武器供应国（美国、英国、法国、中国、俄罗斯和德国）仍占世界武器转移的大部分。,"Yet despite this, the top six arms suppliers (US, UK, France, China, Russia, Germany) continue to account for the bulk of world arms transfers."
4512,当技术在国际上广泛扩散，比较优势受相对要素供给决定时，社会对劳动力产生最强烈的影响。,The most radical effects of trade on labour arise when technology has become widely diffused internationally and comparative advantage is largely determined by relative factor supplies.
4512,如果特有的优势丧失，规模效应不起决定作用，那么支持高工资的基础就会动摇，人们就会期望工资的趋同。,"If specific advantages are eroded and scale effects do not predominate, the basis for sustaining higher wages falls and wage convergence may be expected."
4512,这种情况既适用于发达国家间的贸易，也适用于发达国家和发展中国家的贸易。,This can apply to trade between developed countries as well as between developed and developing countries.
4513,80年代以来，伴随着贸易壁垒的广泛减少，发展中国家发生了一系列变化。这些变化既是其国内战略，又是多边组织如世界银行、国际货币基金组织和世贸组织压力所致。,"From the 1980s there has been a sea change among developing countries, with widespread reductions in trade barriers, undertaken both as a domestic strategy and under pressure from multilateral institutions like the World Bank, the IMF and WTO."
4513,萨克斯和华纳（1995）发现，从60年代到80年代后期，在全世界范围内，采取广义的贸易开放政策的经济体在人口数量上稳定在不足世界人口总量的1/4，国内生产总值不足世界国内生产总值的一半。,Sachs and Warner (1995) found that from 1960 until the late 1980s the proportion of the world’s economies that could be classed as operating broadly open trade policies was stable at below a quarter measured by population and less than a half measured by GDP.
4513,从那时起，二者的比例分别上升到一半以上和大约2/3。在中国加入世贸组织以后，这个数字还会上升。所以，贸易自由化趋势将持续下去。,"Since then the proportions have risen to over a half and around two-thirds respectively, figures that will rise still further when China is admitted to the WTO and so long as the trend towards trade liberalization continues."
4514,在70年代和80年代，所有西欧国家都加紧了它们的移民立法并加强了警力。,All western European countries tightened up their immigration legislation and enhanced policing powers in the 1970s and 1980s.
4514,这些措施有：对航空运输的严格要求、更严格的签证要求、拒绝寻求避难者的进入并要求一定的法律程序以及对不被官方认可的外来人口进行惩罚等。,These measures included strict sanctions on airline carriers; tighter visa requirements; denying access and the due process of law to asylum seekers; and the active penalization of undocumented aliens.
4514,然而，尽管它们控制了非法越境移民量的增长，但是，仍然没有人能够将不断加剧的非法越境移民潮的方向扭转过来。,"Yet none has been able to reverse the broad tide of rising migratory flows from illegal cross-border entry, though they may have contained its growth."
4515,同样的事情在德国也发生了。但是，这里我们必须再次注意到两国的背景差別。,"Roughly the same thing happened in Germany, and once again it is instructive to view England against the German background."
4515,容克地主能够利用政府的力量去维护自己的地位，并且和德国其它地区的自耕农组成一个联合阵线来对抗这种冲击。,There the Junkers were able to use the state in the effort to preserve their position and also to form a united agricultural front with the peasant proprietors in the rest of Germany.
4515,在任何意义上，德国都没有经过类似废除“谷物法”这样的过程。,At no point did Germany go through experience comparable to the abolition of the Corn Laws.
4515,相反，工业领导部门加入了钢铁与黑麦的联姻（1902年的关税政策使这种联姻达到完满的程度）。作为贸易条件，还通过了增加海军建设项目的计划。,"Instead, leading sectors of industry entered the marriage of iron and rye (fully consummated in the tariff of 1902), gaining as their part of the bargain a program of naval construction."
4515,在一种帝制的和反动的方案的基础上所实现的容克地主、农民和工业利益集团的整个联合，给德国的民主带来了灾难性的结果。,"The whole coalition of Junker, peasant, and industrial interests around a program of imperialism and reaction had disastrous results for German democracy."
4516,总的说来，战争规则、治理反人道的罪行的法律、关于自然资源的使用的立法思想的创新以及人权体制都标志着国际法所涉及的主体与范畴的方向的转换。,"In sum, the rules of war, laws governing crimes against humanity, the innovations in legal thinking on the use of resources and human rights regimes all mark a shift in direction so far as the subject and scope of international law are concerned."
4516,上述观点已转而反对国际法必须是只存在于国家之间的、排他性的法律这一信条。,Opinion has moved against the doctrine that international law must be a law between states only and exclusively.
4516,大量的规则、准规则以及立法变化的出现正处于争论之中，这些新的规则和变化正开始转变全球秩序中共存与合作的基础。,"At issue is the emergence of a vast body of rules, quasi-rules and legal changes which are beginning to alter the basis of coexistence and cooperation in the global order."
4517,它为非殖民化，为寻求国际制度改革提供了一个正式的框架。,"It has provided a formal framework for decolonization, and for the pursuit of the reform of international institutions."
4517,更为重要的是，它有助于一种复杂的提供“国际公共物品”的治理体系的发展，其所提供的“国际公共物品”的范围从国际空中交通控制、电信和邮政（将一些早先建立的国际组织置于自己的领导之下），到对传染病的控制，对难民和自然灾害的受害者的人道主义救济，以及对共同的环境的保护（特别是臭氧层和气候的变化，参见Imber， 1997；下面的第2、8章）。所有这些“物品”都需要国际合作来进行分配并对之进行有效的保护。,"Moreover, it has aided the development of an elaborate system of governance for the provision of 'international public goods’，from international air traffic control, telecommunications and posts (bringing some of the earlier established international organizations under its auspices) to the control of contagious diseases, humanitarian relief for refugees and victims of natural disasters, and the protection of the environmental commons (especially the ozone layer and climate alteration) (see Imber, 1997; and see chapters 2 and 8 below). All these 'goods' require international cooperation in order to deliver and safeguard them effectively."
4518,上层穿袍贵族通过高等法院，支持并加剧了封建领主的反动活动。,Through the parlements the higher echelons of the noblesse de robe supported and intensified the seigneurial reaction.
4518,正如我们已经看到的，王权官僚政治在以前曾被用于榨取商品化了的财富来为王权服务。,"Formerly, as we have seen, the royal bureaucracy had served to attract commercial wealth to the royal cause."
4518,然而，它也造成了如下的结果，就是使一些弱小的仅有一定影响的资产阶级变成个人私有财产特权的有力维护者。,"However, it had also had the consequence of turning a small but influential section of the bourgeoisie into vehement defenders of privileges conceived of as private property attached to the individual."
4519,在这种情况下，金融全球化改变了经济利益的平衡，偏向资本和偏离劳动力。,In this context financial globalization shifts the balance of economic advantage further towards capital and away from labour.
4519,但全球金融市场并不像许多全球化论者所说的那样是福利国家的终结。,"But global financial markets do not, as many hyperglobalists imply, simply spell the end of the welfare state."
4519,如上所述，扩张的经济政策和坚实的福利工程不会被金融全球化所排除，而市场则使政府的国际借贷或汇率下降代价更大（Garrett， 1996）。,"As noted above, expansionary economic policies and strong welfare programmes are not precluded by financial globalization, but rather markets impose on governments higher costs of international borrowing or falling exchange rates (Garrett, 1996)."
4520,许多跨国组织超越领土界线，跨越世界主要地区，组织利益团体，实现远距离的一致行动（可参见以下第8章对环境组织的探讨）。,"Many of these transnational organizations function to coordinate action at a distance, organizing communities of interest across territorial boundaries and across the world's major regions (see, for instance, the discussion of environmental groups in chapter 8 below)."
4520,有些组织代表了特殊的跨国团体，如代表了天主教会或者社会运动，例如一些生态保护组织和妇女运动组织等。,"Some represent particular transnational communities, for example, the Catholic Church, or social movements such as that of ecology or the women's movement."
4520,其他还有一些恶性的组织如恐怖组织或者犯罪集团等。,Others are less benign forms of transnational organization such as terrorist and criminal organizations.
4521,上层穿袍贵族通过高等法院，支持并加剧了封建领主的反动活动。,Through the parlements the higher echelons of the noblesse de robe supported and intensified the seigneurial reaction.
4521,正如我们已经看到的，王权官僚政治在以前曾被用于榨取商品化了的财富来为王权服务。,"Formerly, as we have seen, the royal bureaucracy had served to attract commercial wealth to the royal cause."
4521,然而，它也造成了如下的结果，就是使一些弱小但有一定影响的资产阶级变成个人私有财产特权的有力维护者。,"However, it had also had the consequence of turning a small but influential section of the bourgeoisie into vehement defenders of privileges conceived of as private property attached to the individual."
4521,这里资产阶级的行动和思维方式再次通过旧秩序的毛孔渗透进来。,Here again capitalist ways of thinking and acting were seeping through the pores of the old order.
4521,在18世纪期间，这些倾向继续增长并得到了加强。,During the eighteenth century these trends continued and intensified.
4522,战后，一些内在的缺陷变得更加突出。,"After the war, certain inherent shortcomings became more obvious."
4522,虽然我们仍然对他们早期成功所付出的一部分代价记忆犹新，但现在不妨把它们暂且放在一旁。,"For the moment we may leave these aside, though it is essential to remember they formed part of the price of earlier success."
4522,在农业社会关系里，上述一切情况的发生并没有伴随在何和平的或暴力的革命，这是一项令人瞩目的成绩。,"The feat was a rather remarkable one because it took place without any revolution, peaceful or violent, in agrarian social relationships."
4523,个人主义和世俗主义是意大利文艺复兴的两个主要特征，在知识界和文艺界尤为夺目。,Individualism and secularism---two characteristics of the Italian Renaissance---were most noticeable in the intellectual and artistic realms.
4523,意大利的文化到14世纪末已经成熟。,Italian culture had matured by the fourteenth century.
4523,在接下来的两个世纪中，意大利成为欧洲文化的引领者。,"For the next two centuries, Italy was the cultural leader of Europe."
4523,这种新型的意大利文化主要是相对富裕的城市上层社会的产物。,"This new Italian culture was primarily the product of a relatively wealthy, urban lay society."
4523,与文艺复兴相伴生的最为重要的文学运动是人文主义。,The most important literary movement associated with the Renaissance is humanism.
4524,表2-1概括了当代全球武器生产的结构，其中5个方面的特征值得详尽阐述。,The structure of contemporary global military production is summarized in table 2.1. Five features are worth elaboration.
4524,第一，战后的大部分时间，苏联和美国主宰了全球的武器生产不足为奇，但是今天美国毫无疑问是最主要的武器生产国。,"First, the Soviet Union and the US, not surprisingly, dominated global arms production for much of the postwar period but today the US is, without doubt, the leading arms producer."
4524,如果不是因为19世纪早期的军事工业革命，列强和附属国家之间的军事生产能力的差距也不会如此之大。,Not since the military-industrial revolution of the early nineteenth century has the gap in military production capacity between the great powers and subordinate powers been so dramatic.
4525,第三部分通常由森林、河流与牧场组成，如人们所知，这是领主和农奴共同使用的公用地。人们在这里采薪、狩猎和放牧。,"A third part, generally consisting of woods, streams, and pasture, was known as the commons and served as a source of valuable fuel, game, and pastureland for both the lord and his peasants."
4525,为了确保领主获得适宜的劳动力，农奴们以种种方式被束缚于土地上。,"Partly in order to assure the lord an adequate supply of labor, the peasants were tied in various ways to the soil."
4526,昔斯特和米勒勾勒了西方国家存在的4种公民身份模式。西方国家的公民身份既是公民身份和民族认同观念的代名同，又是产生那种文化情境下的各种公共政策的体现：移民政策、归化政策和教台与文化政策。,"Castles and Miller outline four models of citizenship in Western countries which serve as proxies both for attitudes to citizenship and national identity and for clusters of public policies that emerge from that cultural context: immigration policies, naturalization policies and educational and cultural policies."
4526,这4种模式或策略是：虚幻的 、排他性的、共和帝国的和多文化的。,Those four models/strategies are: illusory; exclusionary; republican-imperial; and multicultural.
4527,同样，激进共和党人也获得了北方工人的有力支持。,The Radical Republicans also received substantial support from Northern labor.
4527,北方工人尽管对废奴主义者的宣传态度冷淡，担忧黑人的到来会制造竞争，认为新英格兰的废奴主义者是工厂主的哗众取宠的代表，但是，他们对于保护关税和延缓北方货币贬值的思想给予了热切关注。,"Even though Northern workers were very cool to abolitionist propaganda, fearing Negro competition and regarding New England abolitionists as hypocritical representatives of the mill owners, they were enthusiastic about Radical conceptions of tariff protection and going slow on the contraction of inflated Northern currency."
4527,在另一方面，金融界和商业界对于激进分子处之漠然，因此，战争结束后，主要激进分子把矛头指向了“北方富豪统治集团”。,"Financial and commercial interests, on the other hand, were unenthusiastic about the Radicals.After the war, principled Radicals turned against the ""plutocracy of the North."""
4528,在第一章和第二章我们将看到，现代民族国家与以前的政治统治形式的区别作于：前者在主权、领土、合法性以及民主（经历了19、20世纪的奋斗之后才获得的）之间实现了恰当的对称和对应关系。,"Modern nation-states, as will be seen from chapters 1 and 2, distinguish themselves from previous forms of political rule by claiming a proper symmetry and correspondence between sovereignty, territory, legitimacy and, with the passage of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, democracy."
4528,主权概念明确提出政治权力有权在固定领土内行使 （参见Skinner， 1978，第2卷；Held， 1995，第2章）。,"The concept of sovereignty lodges a distinctive claim to the rightful exercise of political power over a circumscribed realm (see Skinner, 1978, vol. 2; Held, 1995, ch. 2)."
4528,它试图指出在一个有既定领土的共同体中，政治权威不仅有权决定规则、管制以及政策的抿架，而且有权根据这个框架进行统治。,"It seeks to specify the political authority within a community which has the right to determine the framework of rules, regulations and policies within a given territory and to govern accordingly."
4529,90年代，流量的增长已经将它们的股票市场与世界市场紧密地联系起来。,In the 1990s increased flows have linked their stock markets more closely with world markets.
4529,但是最贫穷国家处于私人国际资金的边缘，仅能依靠政府援助。,But the poorest countries have remained on the margins of private international finance and reliant on official aid flows.
4529,实际上，1998年，大约90个国家受国际货币基金组织的各种形式调整计划的影响。,"Indeed, in 1998 some ninety countries were under various forms of IMF adjustment programmes."
4530,政府看起来对于危机束手无策。,Governments seemed powerless to deal with the crisis.
4530,对付萧条的经典的自由主义办法就是采取一种通货紧缩的政策以平衡预算，包括削减工资以降低成本，提高关税以将其他国家的商品排挤在本国市场之外，但这些办法都加剧了经济危机，并使大众感到更为不满。,"The classical liberal remedy for depression, a deflationary policy of balanced budgets, which involved cutting costs by lowering wages and raising tariffs to exclude other countries' goods from home markets, served only to worsen the economic crisis and create even greater mass discontent."
4530,这反过来引发了严重的政治危机。,This in turn led to serious political repercussions.
4531,正因为这种混合物构成了国民党的主要社会基础，所以它的农业政策便在于维护或恢复当时的状况。,"As this fusion formed the main social basis of the Kuomintang, its agrarian policy was one of trying to maintain or restore the status quo."
4531,而独立的共产党对抗力量的存在，造成了两极对峙的形势，使国民党日趋反动和专横。,"In addition, the presence of the Communist rival with de facto independence tended to polarize.the situation and make Kuomintang policy more reactionary and oppressive."
4531,一位同情国民党的美国学者描述了这种情况的一般特征：“共产党的活动是狂热的周期性农民起义的延续，而国民政府和国民党则是占支配地位的达官贵人的后继者。”,"An American scholar sympathetic to the Kuomintang offers this general characterization: ""The Communists act as the inheritors to temporarily fanatical peasant rebellions: the National Government and the Kuomintang to ascendant mandarinates."""
4532,70年代，日本生产商贏得竞争并开始控制这一工业部门。同汽车工业一样，起关键作用的是它们创新的管理技术。,"In the 1970s, Japanese producers achieved notable competitive success and came to dominate sectors of the industry; as with the car industry, their innovative management techniques were crucial."
4532,直到80年代中期，日本公司比美国公司更趋于国内导向：它们保持着国内生产的相当份额，并且从国内公司索取甚多，因为它们依靠国内生产贏得竞争优势。,"Until the mid-1980s, Japanese firms were much more domestically oriented than US firms: they retained a greater share of production domestically and sourced more from domestic firms as they derived a competitive advantage from producing at home."
4533,由于石化工业的规模经济，跨国公司将生产集中在几个地方，并通过出口满足市场需求。,"With high scale economies in petrochemicals, firms concentrated production in a few locations and served markets by exporting."
4533,相对标准化的技术使跨国公司愿意在地理上集中生产，而不是采取特许生产，以保持其技术优势。,"Even with relatively standardized technology MNCs generally preferred to concentrate production geographically, rather than licensing it, in order to preserve technological advantages."
4533,因为主要的市场都位于经合发国家，工资在总成本中占相对较小的比例，所以，不像其他工业那样有什么经济刺激可以促使生产向发展中国家转移。,Since the major markets are located in OECD economies and wages are a relatively small proportion of total costs there has been little economic incentive to shift production to developing countries as in other industries.
4534,这种结合仅仅产生于西欧。,This complex arose only in Western Europe.
4534,只是在这里，才发生了王权过强或过弱的微妙平衡。对于议会民主，这是一种重要的推动力量。,Only there did that delicate balance occur between too much and too little royal power which gave an important impetus to parliamentary democracy.
4534,在其他国家，也出现过形形色色的具有局部意义的等级会议，但比之西欧，它们不是缺少重要的成分，就是没有关键性的均衡。,A wide variety of partial resemblances do occur elsewhere but seem to lack either a crucial ingredient or the crucial proportion among them found in Western Europe.
4534,俄国社会曾发展出一种等级机构。,"Russian society did develop a system of estates, the soslovii."
4534,但独立的贵族遭到伊凡雷帝的沉重打击，经过彼得大帝的强权统治以后，恢复贵族特权的希望终成泡影。贵族虽取得某些权利，但在统治过程中已不再拥有法人代表及相应的契约。,But Ivan the Terrible broke the back of the independent nobility.The attempt to recover their privileges came after the strong hand of Peter the Great had been removed and resulted in obtaining privileges without corresponding obligations or corporate representation in the process of governing.
4535,后来，如同在希腊那样，君主政体被废除，贵族成为社会的统治者。,"Then, as in Greece, the monarchy was abolished, and the patricians became the dominant element in society."
4535,从前由国王掌握的帝权这时转到两名执政官手中；执政官由选举产生，任期一年，总是由贵族担任。,"The sovereign power formerly held by the king was now delepted to two consuls, who were elected for one-year periods and who were always patricians."
4535,元老院是主要立法机关，也是贵族团体，甚至在接纳若干平民后其性质仍然不变。,"The Senate, which was the principal legislative body, was also an aristocratic institution and remained so even after a few commoners, or plebeians, were admitted."
4536,正如本章前面部分所论述的，当今时代代表了全球武器贸易和武器采购的组织和性质上的重大变迁。,"As earlier sections of this chapter have recounted, the contemporary era represents a significant transformation in the organization and nature of the global arms trade and of arms procurement."
4536,在这里所讨论的6个发达资本主义国家中，最近20年见证了国防工业基础跨国化的重大发展。,"Among the six SIACS discussed here, the last two decades in particular have witnessed a notable transnationalization of the defence industrial base."
4536,削减国防采购预算和国防工业生产过剩能力共同推动了所有国家国防工业在国内外的重组。,Declining defence procurement budgets and defence industrial overcapacity have combined to produce a major (ongoing) restructuring of the defence industry both within and across all states.
4537,正如本章前面部分所论述的，当今时代代表了全球武器贸易和武器采购的组织和性质上的重大变迁。,"As earlier sections of this chapter have recounted, the contemporary era represents a significant transformation in the organization and nature of the global arms trade and of arms procurement."
4537,在这里所讨论的6个发达资本主义国家中，最近20年见证了国防工业基础跨国化的重大发展。,"Among the six SIACS discussed here, the last two decades in particular have witnessed a notable transnationalization of the defence industrial base."
4537,削减国防采购预算和国防工业生产过剩能力共同推动了所有国家国防工业在国内外的重组。,Declining defence procurement budgets and defence industrial overcapacity have combined to produce a major (ongoing) restructuring of the defence industry both within and across all states.
4538,这3种趋势有助于界定一种历史背景，在其中发达资本主义国家卷入世界军事秩序的模式得到诠释。,These three trends help define the historical context within which patterns of national enmeshment in the world military order among SIACS are to be interpreted.
4538,这些模式能从对战后趋势的检验中得出，这些趋势包括国家用于国防的资源、国防工业基础、武器贸易和国际安全结构中的成员地位等，以及军事力量在外部的部署和使用。,These patterns will be constructed from an examination of postwar trends in national resources devoted to defence; the DIB; the arms trade; membership of international security structures; and the external use or deployment of military force.
4538,本研究中的每一个国家——美国、日本、瑞典、英国、徳国和法国——的个体肖像将从各国卷入世界军事秩序的结构中出现。,"For each of the countries in the study - US, Japan, Sweden, UK, Germany and France - an individual portrait will emerge of the structure of national enmeshment in the world military order."
4539,与20世纪早期相比，正如大战的灾难性后果所显示的，那时使用武力（或威胁使用武力）的决定是国家政府单独享有的独一无二的权力，但是多边防御和安全部署的增长，使得没被削弱的政府在此方面的决策变得错综复杂。,"In comparison with the early twentieth century when, as the catastrophe of the Great War demonstrated, decisions to (threaten to) use military force were the unquestioned preserve of national governments alone, the growth of multilateral defence and security arrangements complicates, if it does not compromise, government decision-making in this regard."
4539,条约义务、军事和防御承诺、军事能力、后勤和军队的连锁性质，国际化的国防生产与武器采购，以及其他因素，改变了政治环境和涉及国防政策所有方面的成本与利益的国家决策政治学，但最突出的还是军事力量使用或宣布战争。,"Treaty obligations, military and defence commitments, the interlocking nature of military capabilities, logistics and forces, internationalized defence production and weapons procurement, among other factors, transform the political context and the politics of national decision-making with respect to the costs and benefits of all aspects of defence policy, but most especially the use of military force or the declaration of war."
4539,尽管所有的发达资本主义国家最终保有宣布战争或使用武力的法理上的主权，但是军事行动的可选择过程的成本和利益在某些关键方面受到正式或非正式承诺的限制。,"Although all SIACS ultimately retain the de jure sovereign power to declare war or to (threaten to) use military force, the costs and benefits of alternative courses of military action are circumscribed, in some key respects, by both formal and informal commitments."
4540,在这方面，一个更有说服力的例子是在当代的国际法中，牢固地树立—个合法的国家必须是一个维护某些共同的民主价值的国家这一观念的倾向（参见Crawforcl和Marks，1998）。,"A further telling example in this regard is the tendency in contemporary international law to entrench the notion that a legitimate state must be a state that upholds certain common democratic values (see Crawford and Marks, 1998)."
4540,例如，《世界人权官言》第21条宣称，民主原则与某些列举出的权利一起作为一种“所有人民和国家追求的共同标准”（参见UN，1998，第2、5页）。,"For instance, in Article 21 the Universal Declaration of Human Rights asserts the democratic principle along with enumerated rights as a 'common standard of achievement for all peoples and nations' (see UN, 1988, pp. 2, 5)."
4540,但是，“民主”一词却并未出现在《宣言》中，并且形容同“民主的”也只出现了一次（在第29条）。,
4541,与前几个世纪相比，战后时代的一些重要的联盟协定都更加正式、更加制度化。,Compared to previous centuries the major alliance arrangements in the postwar era have been much more formal and institutionalized.
4541,联盟表示一种手段，通过该手段，国家对军事权力的使用在国家之间层次上受到管制。,Alliances represent one means by which the state's employment of military power is regulated at an interstate level.
4541,在不同程度上，它们也体现了一种军事国际化的过程。,To varying degrees they also represent a process of the internationalization of military security.
4542,最初这种货币都是贵金属如黄金。,Initially this was usually precious metals such as gold.
4542,金银的跨洲流动可追溯到20世纪（Watson，1967），自那时起，洲际贸易的兴起在贸易者之间产生了交错的金融关系。,"Transcontinental movements of gold and silver can be dated back to the twelfth century (Watson, 1967), and the rise of intercontinental trade from that time brought intermittent financial relations between traders."
4542,"有组织的国际金融基本上可上溯到14世纪，那时佛罗伦萨商人银行如著名的Peruzzi公司，通过建立“外国的”机构或与外国银行的互惠制度发展了跨国联系（Abulafia, 1997；Hunt, 1994）。","Organized international finance dates primarily from the fourteenth century when Florentine merchant banks, such as the famous Peruzzi Company, developed multinational links by establishing either 'foreign' operations or reciprocal arrangements with foreign banks (Abulafia, 1997; Hunt, 1994)."
4543,第一次世界大战之后，全面裁军的提倡者们发现国际联盟为进一步的裁军提供了新的制度性论坛（Howard，1981）。,"In the aftermath of the First World War the advocates of general and complete disarmament discovered, in the League of Nations, a new institutional forum within which to further the disarmament project (Howard, 1981)."
4543,从1932-1934年，世界上64个被承认的国家在日内瓦举行的世界裁军大会上聚集讨论全面裁军的过程。,From 1932 to 1934 all the worlds sixty-four recognized states met in Geneva at the World Disarmament Conference to initiate the process of general and complete disarmament.
4543,但是谈判破裂，收效甚微，“现实主义”战胜了“理想主义”。,"But ""realism"" triumphed over ""idealism"", with the conference breaking up having achieved little."
4544,即使是冷战的结束也未能瓦解它，因为它已经扩展到将一些前华沙条约成员国包括进来（比如波兰、匈牙利和捷克共和国），并且通过和平伙伴计划，将俄罗斯、瑞典和其他欧洲国家包括进来。,"Even the ending of the Cold War has not undermined it, since it has expanded to include some former Warsaw Pact members (such as Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic) and, through the Partnership for Peace (PFP) arrangement, Russia, Sweden and other European states."
4544,无论是从其日常事物还是在国际危机时刻，北大西洋公约组织都为多边决策和军事合作提供了一种制度化的机制，从而使国家安全和军事自主的观念成为可能。,
4544,,"In both the routine conduct of its affairs and in times of international crisis, NATO provides an institutional mechanism for multilateral decision-making and military cooperation which significantly qualifies the idea of national security and military autonomy."
4544,安全不再仅仅是按照国家地理疆界的防御来进行定义，而是根据集体防御和国际安全来确定。,"Security is no longer simply defined in terms of the defence of national territorial boundaries, but rather in terms of collective defence and international security."
4545,发展中国家对外国直接投资和跨国公司的政策在第二次世界大战后有了很大改观。,Among developing countries policy towards FDI and MNCs has altered considerably during the postwar period.
4545,很早时候起，一些国家就欢迎外国直接投资，而其他国家则限制跨国公司。,"Earlier on, while some actively welcomed inward FDI, others placed a variety of restrictions on MNCs."
4545,除限制外国直接投资进入某些领域外，发展中国家常常对跨国公司的经营施加规定。,"Besides limiting FDI in certain areas, developing countries often imposed operational requirements on MNCs."
4545,另外，50年代和60年代，发展中国家还存在相当规模的国有化和没收私产的措施，其中大部分是在初级工业部门。,"Moreover, there were a number of significant nationalizations and expropriations in developing countries in the 1950s and 1960s, largely in the primary sector industries."
4545,但是，国有化和没收私产现在已经几乎不存在了。因为日益增长的制造业外国直接投资意味着国有化使一国经济丧失必要的引进新技术的机会。,But nationalizations and expropriations have declined to negligible levels since the growing significance of manufacturing FDI means that nationalization would deprive an economy of vital inflows of new technology.
4546,当然，小国的国家融入全球和区域文化交往及其过程的程度是不同的。,"Of course, the extent of national enmeshment of individual countries in global and regional cultural flows and processes varies."
4546,例如，从信息和文化产品占据国内市场的主导地位以及在国际市场中所处的位置这个角度来看，在我们所研究的个案国家中，美国是独一无二的。,"In the context of our case study countries, the US is in a class of its own in terms of its domination of its own home market as well as its place in the international markets for information and cultural products."
4546,英国、日本、法国和德国的文化产业在其国内市场中占据相当大的份额。,"The UK, Japan, France and Germany have significant shares of their domestic markets, served by their own culture industries."
4547,到1927年，国民党依靠中国共产觉和苏联的重要支持，已从南方的基地进而控制了中国的各个重要省份。,"With important native Communist and Soviet assistance, the Kuomintang by late 1927 had won control of a substantial part of China, working out from its base in the south."
4547,直到那时，国民党的胜利主要还是由于成功地利用和支配了工农大众普遍的不满情绪。,"Up to this moment, its success had been mainly due to its ability to harness and ride the tides of discontent among the peasants and the workers."
4547,因此，国民党的社会纲领有别于军阀的纲领，并远在他们之上。,Thus the Kuomintang’s social program distinguished it from the warlords and gave it an advantage over them.
4547,有一段时间，人们对国民党军事力量寄以厚望，希望他们打败军阀势力，在革命纲领的基础上统一中国。,"For a time, hopes ran high that the Kuomintang’s military force might overcome the warlords and unify China on the basis of a revolutionary program."
4548,第五，国内事务与国外事务之间、内部政治问题与外部政治问题之间、一个民族国家的主权与国际权利之间的区別，已不能再清楚地划分。,"Fifth, the distinctions between domestic and foreign affairs, internal political issues and external questions, the sovereign concerns of a nation-state and international considerations, are no longer clear cut."
4548,政府面临着诸如毒品、艾滋病、疯牛病、非再生资源的利用、核废弃物的控制、大规模杀伤性武器的扩散以及全球变暖等问题，用这些词语并不能将其进行有意义的分类。,"Governments face issues such as drugs, AIDS, BSE (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy), the use of non-renewable resources, the management of nuclear waste, the spread of weapons of mass destruction, and global warming which cannot meaningfully be categorized in these terms."
4548,此外，多国公司的定位及投资策略、全球金融市场的规范、在全球劳动分工与缺乏资本控制的背景下对个国家的税收基础的威胁等问题都对国家经济政策的一些关键措施的存在价值提出了质疑 （参见第3-5章）。,"Moreover, issues like the location and investment strategy of MNCs, the regulation of global financial markets, the threats to the tax base of individual countries in the context of a global division of labour and the absence of capital controls all pose questions about the continued value of some of the central instruments of national economic policy (see chapters 3-5)."
4549,不仅范围逐渐扩大，跨国公司活动的强度在逐渐加深。,"Just as the reach of MNCs has grown, so has the intensity of their activities."
4549,虽然有全面的外国直接投资资料，但关于跨国公司全部活动及其海外生产的资料却非常不系统。,"Although there are comprehensive FDI data, there are less systematic data available on the total activity of MNCs and their overseas production."
4549,然而随后的分析显示，第二次世界大战后跨国公司在世界经济中的重要性无疑有显著增强。,"But the importance of MNCs in the world economy has undoubtedly grown in the postwar period, as the following analysis suggests."
4550,据联合国计算，在战后的头几十年里，熟练劳动力的国际迁移人数约为30万~40万。,"In the first few decades of the postwar era, the UN has calculated that international migration of highly skilled labour was around 300-400,000 people."
4550,精英迁移的主要来源是印度、中国、斯里兰卡和加纳。,"The major sources of this burst of elite migration were India, China, Sri Lanka and ghana."
4550,美国吸收了12万精英迁移者，英国和加拿大分别吸收了8万人（A.Segal，1993）。,"The USA absorbed 120,000 of these migrants and the UK and Canada over 80,000 each (A. Segal, 1993)."
4550,从70年代开始，海湾国家已经变成了熟练劳动力的重要输入国，但是流向西方的人数，加上来自菲律宾、巴基斯坦、阿根廷和巴西的移民，仍然继续急剧增加。,"Since the 1970s, the Gulf states have become key importers of highly skilled labour, but flows to the West continue apace with the addition of people from the Philippines, Pakistan, Argentina and Brazil."
4551,这个地区的主要劳工进口国是科威特、沙特阿拉伯、卡塔尔、阿曼、巴林和阿拉伯联合酋长国以及北部的伊朗和伊拉克。,"The main labour-importing states in the region have been Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, as well as Iran and Iraq to the north."
4551,主要的输出国是埃及、也门、约旦、黎巴嫩和苏丹。,"The main exporters have been Egypt, Yemen, Jordan, Lebanon and Sudan."
4551,在海湾战争期间，这些国家的移民总数估计有近200万~300万（A.Segal，1993；根据Martin，1991）。,"The estimate for all migrants among these states prior to the Gulf War is around 2-3 million (A. Segal, 1993, based on Martin, 1991)."
4552,本项研究中涉及的欧洲国家的海岸线的长度极其不同，而且它们也有通往共同海洋环境的不同通道（有关欧洲海洋和污染，请参看P.Haas，1990，1993）。,"The European countries in this study have radically different lengths of coastline and access to common marine environments.(On European seas and pollution see P.Haas, 1990, 1993.)"
4552,对这些国家来说，最重要的区域性海洋是北海、波罗的海和地中海。,"The most important regional seas for these states are the North Sea, the Baltic and the Mediterranean."
4552,这些海洋都被广泛利用，而且除北海外沿海地区人口稠密。,"These are heavily used and densely populated on much of their shoreline, though less so for the North Sea."
4553,只是在这些情况下，我们才有理由谈论海洋污染的区域化和全球化问题。,It is only in these cases that we can reasonably talk of the regionalization or globalization of marine pollution.
4553,不幸的是，我们很难准确地用这种方式分解数据统计，因为不同污染物的发源地和最终的目的地是很难跟踪的。因此，对我们所做个案研究的国家的海洋污染情况，我们只能作出相对令人满意的描述。,"Unfortunately, it is difficult to disaggregate statistics accurately in this way-the origins and destinations of different pollutants are notoriously hard to track-so only a fairly impressionistic picture of marine pollution in our case study countries can be drawn."
4554,结果，整个亚洲形成了一种有等级的生产组织。,As a consequence a hierarchy of production organization has developed across Asia.
4554,多数劳动密集型生产过程从先进工业国，特别是韩国迁至欠发达国家，如中国。,"The most labour-intensive production processes have migrated from the leading economies, notably Korea, to less advanced economies, including China."
4554,,Korea has become a significant producer of finished electronic products in its own right and poses a competitive challenge to existing producers.
4554,韩国自力更生，成为相当重要的电子产品生产商，并对已有的生产商形成威胁。,Korea has become a significant producer of finished electronic products in its own right and poses a competitive challenge to existing producers.
4555,非洲国家的状况差异很大，但许多国家在90年代已经取消了对跨国公司的限制和规定。,"The position varies widely among African countries, but many have removed restrictions and requirements on MNCs during the 1990s."
4555,在转轨国家，特别是较发达的国家中，对外直接投资的许多限制已经减少或取消。当然，在某些情况下，人们更青睐与国内公司联合的合资公司而不是全资的外国分支公司。,"Among transition economies, particularly the more advanced, many restrictions on FDI have been reduced or eliminated, although in some cases there remains a strong preference for joint ventures with domestic firms rather than wholly owned foreign subsidiaries."
4556,因此，核电产生的环境威胁包括放射性原料泄漏；来自提炼、电厂和再加工工厂的含有放射性的水和气体；以及不同程度的核废料泄漏。,"Thus the environmental threats presented by nuclear power include the escape of radioactive materials into the environment; the emission of radio-active water and gases from refining, power and reprocessing plants; and the escape of radioactivity from low-level, medium-level and high-level nuclear waste."
4556,最后，也是最具威胁性的是反应堆故障带来的潜在问题。反应堆故障中，一旦控制失灵，反应堆就可能“融毁”，这将导致更多放射性物质泄漏出来。,"Finally, and most threatening of all, there is the potential problem of reactor malfunction, in which control is lost and a 'meltdown' is possible, leading to infinitely larger emissions of radioactive substances."
4557,没有没收和重分土地，只靠新的劳动力体系，种植园体制就恢复了。,"In the absence of confiscation and redistribution of land, the plantation system recovered by means of a new system of labor."
4557,最初，种植园主曾打算使用雇佣劳力，但却失败了——因为黑人只想在清闲季节挣钱，当摘棉花的繁忙季节来到时，他们却逃之夭夭。,"At first there were attempts with wage labor.These failed, at least partly because Negroes were inclined to draw their wages in slack months and abscond when the cotton had to be picked."
4557,于是一种便于种植园主控制劳力的交谷租种方式开始广泛流行起来。,Hence there was a widespread turn towar.d sharecropping which gave the planters superior control of their labor force.
4557,这一变化是很有意义的，就象我们在一定时候将要看到的，在亚洲很多地方，交谷租种成了一种从农民那里获取盈余的途径。这主要是通过经济手段，当然有时也借助些政治手段，因此，注意到美国在没有农民历史的情况下，这时却也出现了与亚洲基本类似的农村经济是有意义的。,"The change was significant.As we shall see in due course, sharecropping in many parts of Asia has constituted one way of extracting a surplus from the peasant through economic rather than political methods, though the latter are often necessary to buttress the former.Hence it is instructive to see fundamentally similar forms appear in America without the prior existence of a peasantry."
4558,黑死病是七个世纪以来袭击欧洲的首例重大传染病。此间中世纪欧洲的人口一度激增，原因之一就在于没有传染病流行。,"The Black Death was the first major epidemic disease to strike Europe in seven centuries, an absence that helps explain medieval Europe’s remarkable population growth."
4558,而这场巨大的瘟疫最初源于亚洲。,
4558,中世纪时期，淋巴腺鼠疫在欧洲和中东地区一度消失，但在中国西南部曾持续一段时间，尤其是在偏僻的农村。,"Having disappeared from Europe and the Middle East in the Middle Ages, bubonic plague continued to haunt parts of southwestern China, especially isolated rural territories."
4559,在80年代中期，武器出口达到战后最高点480亿 〜500亿美元，之后在1991年又迅速回落到低于高峰期开支的一半（参看图2-2）。,Arms exports reached a postwar peak of $48-50 billion in the mid-1980s after which they declined precipitately to below half that figure in 1991 (see figure 2.2).
4559,即使如此，后冷战时代世界武器出口的总值仍高于60年代。,"Even so, in the post-Cold War era the value of world arms exports remains above that of the 1960s."
4559,但是这些全球性的数据掩盖了武器转移模式在结构上的重大变迁。,But global figures disguise a significant structural shift in the pattern of arms transfers.
4560,后现代主义在文学上也表现得很明显。,Postmodernism was also evident in literature.
4560,后现代主义的中心之一是中欧和东欧，捷克斯洛伐克人米兰·昆徳拉（1929—  ）的作品尤其突出。,"One center of Postmodernism was in central and eastern Europe, especially in the work of Milan Kundera (b. 1929) of Czechoslovakia."
4560,昆徳拉把幻想揉进现实主义，用幻想去检视仍对人类生活状况保持乐观的道德问题。,"Kundera blended fantasy with realism, using fantasy to examine moral issues while remaining optimistic about the human condition."
4560,实际上，从他1984年出版的第一部小说《不能承受的生命之轻》中可以看出，他没有因为他描写了家乡的政治压抑而感到绝望，而是让他笔下的人物形象以爱作为通向美好生活的方式。,"Indeed, in his first novel, The Unbearable Lightness of Being, published in 1984, Kundera does not despair because of the political repression that he so aptly describes in his native land but allows his characters to use love as a way to a better life."
4560,人的精神可以被磨炼但不能被毁掉。,The human spirit can be diminished but not destroyed.
4561,前苏联及其东欧的卫星同样不可能阻止西方无线电和电视广播的接收或外国文本的输入。,The Soviet Union and its East European satellites were unable to prevent the reception of Western radio and TV broadcasts or the import of foreign texts.
4561,互联网为这些国家的公民避免政府对信息的控制提供了另外一种渠道，同时，这些渠道使得国家政府越来越难以控制那些“坏消息”被泄漏出去。,"The World Wide Web provides yet another channel through which citizens in such states can evade the information controls of government.Simultaneously, these channels make it more difficult for national governments to control 'bad news' from leaking out of the country."
4561,换句话说，国家政府管理文化信息和文化发展的环境及其能力发生了变化，控制策略的成本和收益已经不可避免地出现了变化。,"In other words, there has been a transformation in the context of national governments and in their capacity to manage cultural formation and development; the costs and benefits of control strategies have ineluctably changed."
4562,对于大多数怀疑论者来说，如果现有的事实说明什么问题的话，那就是经济活动正在经历着一场意义深远的“区域化”，世界经济正在按照3个主要金融和贸易集团——欧洲、亚洲太平洋地区以及北美洲——的方向发展（Ruigrok和Tulder，1995；Boyer和Drache，1996；Hirst和Thompson，1996b）。,"For most sceptics, if the current evidence demonstrates anything it is that economic activity is undergoing a significant 'regionalization' as the world economy evolves in the direction of three major financial and trading blocs, that is, Europe, Asia-Pacific and North America (Ruigrok and Tulder, 1995; Boyer and Drache, 1996; Hirst and Thompson, 1996b)."
4562,与古典金本位时代相比，世界经济现在整合的意义并没有当时那样大（Boyer和Drache，1996；Hirst和Thompson，1996a）。,"In comparison with the classical Gold Standard era, the world economy is therefore significantly less integrated than it once was (Boyer and Drache, 1996; Hirst and Thompson, 1996a)."
4562,在怀疑论者中，全球化和地区化被认为是矛盾的趋势。,"Among the sceptics, globalization and regionalization are conceived as contradictory tendencies."
4563,在18世纪，尽管怀疑主义日渐兴盛，知识分子们也越来越转向自然神论和自然宗教，但大众对宗教的投入和热情似乎并未受过多影响。,"Despite the rise of skepticism and the intellectuals’ belief in deism and natural religion, religious devotion remained strong in the eighteenth century."
4563,很难精确评价欧洲天主教徒的宗教虔诚。,It is difficult to assess precisely the religiosity of Europe’s Catholics.
4563,天主教教区教堂仍然是整个社区的生活中心。,The Catholic parish church remained a center of life for the entire community.
4563,有多少人经常去教堂很难精确地统计出来，但我们已经确知天主教人口中的百分之九十到九十五会去参加教会最重要的庆典之一，复活节的弥撒。,"How many people went to church regularly cannot be known exactly, but 90 to 95 percent of Catholic populations did go to Mass on Easter Sunday, one of the church’s most important celebrations."
4564,威廉·迈克尼尔已经对人类定居和迁移与混杂在我们中间生存、移动的微生物和寄生虫之间的互动进行了全球历史性的阐述 （McNeil1，1976）。,"William McNeill has constructed a global historical narrative around the interaction of human settlement and movement and the microbes and parasites that have stayed, moved and mixed among us (McNeill, 1976)."
4564,的确，在现代以前有记载的人类历史上，惟一具有全球规模的环境变迁的形式就是那些因有害动物和微生物的地理位置发生变化以及遗传基因的突变等引起的环境变迁。,"Indeed, prior to the modern era the only forms of environmental changes during recorded human history to achieve global dimensions are those caused by the geographical shift and genetic mutation of pests and microbes."
4564,在我们的叙述中，我们也将考虑这种环境变迁，尤其是全球性的人口移动将被包括在内（参看第6章）。,"We have included some consideration of this kind of environmental change in our narrative, especially where movements in population at a global level are involved (see chapter 6)."
4565,当这些因素加上许多现代技术中固有的巨大变革力量和生态危险等因素时，如新化学制品产业、依赖矿物燃料的公共交通系统以及核技术等，环境退化就肯定会呈现出全球化形式（参看图8-3中关于当代含氯氟烃的生产情况）。,"When these forces were combined with the immense transformative powers and ecological risks inherent in many modern technologies - new chemicals industries, mass transport systems dependent on fossil fuel, nuclear technologies - environmental degradation acquired a decisively global form (see figure 8.3 regarding CFC production in this era)."
4565,当代跨国污染、全球环境公共品问题以及资源短缺等所达到的水平是历史上绝无仅有的。,"No historic parallel exists for the contemporary levels of transboundary pollution, environmental commons problems and resource squeezes."
4565,因此，对于今天的环境运动、环境条约和国际环境机构来说，其数量和作用前所未有也毫不令人吃惊。,"Nor, unsurprisingly, is there any significant historical comparator for todays environmental movements, treaties and international agencies."
4566,以本章中提出的（以及在前而的网格表8-1和8-2中列出的）证据为基础，我们不难得出关于当代环境全球化模式的许多结论。,"It is not difficult, on the basis of the evidence presented in this chapter (and set out earlier in schematic form in grids 8.1 and 8.2), to draw a number of conclusions about contemporary patterns of environmental globalization."
4566,首先，尽管环境问题有着很长的历史，无论是地方性的、区域性的和全球性的环境问题都如此，但是，我们可以认为，当代环境退化形式比人类历史上任何其他时候都更具有全球性，而且它们对人类生命造成的一系列危害和威胁具有最重要的历史意义。透过西方繁荣来看待这种前景，不仅可以发现因果联系而且其有讽刺意味。,"First, although environmental issues - local, regional and global - have a long history we can argue that contemporary forms of environmental degradation are more global than at any other point in human history and carry with them the most historically significant set of risks and threats to human life.That we view such a prospect from the dizzying heights of Western prosperity is causally related and a little ironic."
4567,当这些因素加上许多现代技术中固有的巨大变革力量和生态危险等因素时，如新化学制品产业、依赖矿物燃料的公共交通系统以及核技术等，环境退化就肯定会呈现出全球化形式（参看图8-3中关于当代含氯氟烃的生产情况）。,"When these forces were combined with the immense transformative powers and ecological risks inherent in many modern technologies - new chemicals industries, mass transport systems dependent on fossil fuel, nuclear technologies - environmental degradation acquired a decisively global form (see figure 8.3 regarding CFC production in this era)."
4567,当代跨国污染、全球环境公共品问题以及资源短缺等所达到的水平是历史上绝无仅有的。,"No historic parallel exists for the contemporary levels of transboundary pollution, environmental commons problems and resource squeezes."
4567,因此，对于今天的环境运动、环境条约和国际环境机构来说，其数量和作用前所未有也毫不令人吃惊。,"Nor, unsurprisingly, is there any significant historical comparator for todays environmental movements, treaties and international agencies."
4568,当代环境全球化模式在许多重要方面都是前所未有的。,"Contemporary patterns of environmental globalization, in many significant respects, are historically unprecedented."
4568,环境运动的乐天派宣称，对全球环境依赖性的认识的提高以及全球环境运动的道德言辞正在向民族国家的政治合法性和政治认同的传统观点提出挑战。,"The optimists of the environmental movement claim that growing recognition of global environmental interdependence, and the moral rhetoric of the global environmental movement, are challenging the traditional locus of political legitimacy and the locus of political identification in the nation-state."
4568,当然，他们也指出，有关环境的国际政治话语出现了一些真正的转变。,"Certainly, they can point to some real shifts in the terms of international political discourse on the environment."
4569,这在一定程度上是由于日本远离亚洲大陆以及风向和气候条件造成的。,This is partly explained by the distance of Japan from mainland Asia and the prevailing winds and climatic conditions.
4569,然而，也有越来越多的证据表明，在东亚和环太平洋地区，区域性的跨国酸雨问题正变得越来越严重。,"However, there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that regional transboundary problems of acid rain are becoming more important in East Asia and the Pacific rim."
4569,由于工业化步伐加速以及能源需求猛增，这个人口稠密的地区正开始感受到各种跨国界的污染流。,"As industrialization gathers pace and energy requirements soar, this densely populated region is beginning to experience a variety of cross-border flows of pollution."
4570,如果汇率是高估的和不稳定的，那么投机者的攻击是不可避免的。,If an exchange rate is simply overvalued and unsustainable then a speculative attack is inevitable.
4570,投资者通过衍生品市场周转大量基金，就像乔治·索罗斯所做的那样。1992年9月，英镑被迫退出欧洲汇率机制，但最关键的是机构投机者的行为以及感到危险就退出的跨国公司的行为。,"Speculators can mobilize massive funds through derivatives markets, as George Soros did when sterling was forced out of the ERM in September 1992, but more critical are the actions of institutional investors and MNCs who tend to move out of a currency if they believe it to be under threat."
4570,如果政府对固定汇率的承诺是可信的，这样的投机就会失败，但还有一些途径可以实现投机目的（Obstfeld， 1996）。,"If a government’s commitment to a fixed exchange rate is credible such attacks will simply fail, but there are several ways in which such attacks can become effectively self-fulfilling (Obstfeld, 1996)."
4571,蓟州军开始训练，就接受了优厚的财政接济以购买军马、制造火器及战车。,At the outset the Chichou command received an extra allocation of combat horses and funds for manufacturing firearms and wagons.
4571,这种和其他军镇的不平等待遇，惹来了大量的反感。,"Though not prodigious in quantity, the appropriation nevertheless caused jealousy and contention."
4571,接着又有一连串的矛盾跟着产生，诸如北兵和南兵的磨擦、军职的继承者和其他出身者的争执、因循守旧和锐意革新的冲突。,"There was also rivalry between northerners and southerners, between local conscripts and recruits, and between officers of the old school and those of the new training program."
4572,在这种倒退的后果中，精英和政府干预态度的转变以及将巴黎作为国际金融中心的愿望促使当局将金融领域自由化和取消资本控制。,"In the aftermath of this reversal, shifting elite attitudes to government intervention and a desire to promote Paris as an international financial centre encouraged the authorities to liberalize the financial sector and abolish capital controls."
4572,80年代末以来，国内货币政策的目标一直是在欧洲汇率机制中维持高汇率，其目的是将通货膨胀率减至德国水平或低于德国水平。1993年欧洲汇率机制危机后，这样的政策继续发挥作用。,"Since the late 1980s, domestic monetary policy has been focused on maintaining a high exchange rate within the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) with the aim of reducing inflation rates to German levels or below, a policy that has largely continued since the ERM crisis of 1993."
4573,尽管一神教是犹太人的创造。但是，一神教的潜在范围和力量却由于基督教和伊斯兰教的传播而成倍增长，基督教和伊斯兰教将单一的道德规范与所有人开放的拯救观结合起来。,"The innovation of monotheism, although a Jewish creation, was multiplied in its potential reach and power by Christianity and Islam, both of which joined a singular moral code to a vision of salvation potentially open to all."
4573,早在18世纪的时候，伊斯兰教就出现在许多地方，尽管它在许多地方的传播不算广泛，但是它保留了下来（Gellner， 1981）。,"Islam achieved a presence in diverse regions as early as the eighth century, a presence it has retained, although it remains thinly spread in many places (Gellner, 1981)."
4574,不过，极端爱国主义者即使在这一阶段也是一支重要的政治力量。,"Nevertheless, patriotic-extremism was even during this period an important political force."
4574,第一次世界大战以后的几年，农村和城市的激进主义分子经常展开暴力斗争。,The early years following World War I were a period of rural as well as urban radicalism that at times took violent forms.
4574,极端爱国主义组织破坏佃户和工人的罢工斗争；与此同时，受雇的地痞恶棍破坏工会，捣毁自由派的报纸。,"Patriotic organizations helped to break tenant and worker strikes, while hired bullies smashed labor unions and liberal newspapers."
4574,政府通过教育部发起了主要针对学生的“反危险思想”运动。,"The government too reacted with a campaign by the Ministry of Education against ""dangerous thoughts,"" directed mainly against students."
4575,虽然就某些产品而言全球贸易体制已经历了几个世纪，但极端全球主义者和变革论者认为，在贸易关系的广度和深度方面，当代是无与伦比的。,"Although for some products a global trading system has operated for centuries, both the hyperglobalizers and the transformationalists regard the contemporary era as unique in respect of the extensity and intensity of trading relations."
4575,在多大程度上当代的贸易往来符合贸易全球化定义，在多大程度上现在商品和服务的市场是在全球范围内运作的，这是分析所需表明的两个关键问题。,"How far contemporary flows of trade are consistent with this notion of trade globalization, and how far markets for goods and services now operate at the global level, constitute key questions which the analysis addresses."
4575,但是什么是全球市场呢？,But what is a global market?
4576,要解释日本式的极权主义的主要特征，有些人倾向于谈论日本价值体系的连续性、特别是武士传统等因素。,"To this explanation of the main features of the Japanese variant of totalitarianism some might be inclined to add the factor of continuity in the Japanese system of values, particularly the warrior tradition of the samurai."
4576,连续性当然是存在的。,Continuity of a sort there certainly was.
4576,但人们必须解释为什么这一传统能够延续。,But one has to explain why the tradition continued.
4576,人类的感情并不是简单地保持原有的方向。,Human sentiments do not persist simply of their own momentum.
4577,家长就是权威。他死后，儿子或者最亲近的男性亲属承担保护人的角色。,"The paterfamilias exercised that authority; on his death, sons or nearest male relatives assumed the role of guardians."
4577,然而，共和国后期，尽管男性作为保护人的权利仍然有效，但上层妇女找到了篡夺她们保护人权力的办法。,"By the late Republic, however, although the rights of male guardians remained legally in effect, upper-class women found numerous ways to circumvent the power of their guardians."
4578,另一方面，许多跨国公司为追求价廉物美的产品（见上面第3章）而将消耗大量资源的产品向国外的中小企业转移（“分割价值链”）。,"On the other hand, many MNCs now outsource production to SMEs abroad ('slicing up the value chain') to achieve cheap high-quality production (see chapter 3 above)."
4578,在此过程中形成的全球生产网络或系统涉及的不是直接所有权，而是相当规范的契约关系。,In the process global production networks or systems are created which involve not direct ownership but rather regularized contractual relationships.
4578,但同样，一国内的中小企业可以通过特许权经营、与其他中小企业合作或者在其中迸行有价证券投资等形式向国外扩展，以形成全球生产和销售链。,"But equally SMEs in one country may expand abroad through franchising, or cooperative arrangements with or portfolio investment in other SMEs to form global production and distribution chains."
4579,尽管僭主政治统治时期很短暂，但在希腊历史演进中也发挥了很重要的作用——结束了贵族寡头的统治。,"Although tyranny did not last, it played a significant role in the course of Greek history by ending the rule of narrow aristocratic oligarchies."
4579,僭主政治的结束为大多数人进入政府敞开了大门。,The end of tyranny opened the door to greater numbers of people in government.
4579,虽然在一些城邦中民主政治达到了顶峰，可其他城邦中各种寡头执政团扩大并继续掌权。,"Although this trend culminated in the development of democracy in some communities, in other states expanded oligarchies of one kind or another managed to remain in power."
4579,希腊各邦统治形式各异。透过对两个最著名最强大的城邦——斯巴达和雅典的研究，或许才能清晰地明白这一点。,"Greek states exhibited considerable variety in their governmental structures; this can perhaps best be seen by examining the two most famous and most powerful Greek city-states, Sparta and Athens."
4580,当然，也出现了一些有意义的变化。,"There were, of course, significant variations."
4580,大坂的商人比起首都江户的商人来说从属性就小些。,"The merchants of Osaka were less dependent than those of the capital, Edo."
4580,并且，在幕府统治后期，乡间商人在物资和市场上对封建关系的依赖性就比旧的城市垄断者们要少。,"And, in the latter part of the period, the provincial merchants showed themselves less dependent on feudal relationships for their materials and markets than did the older urban monopolists."
4581,就全球市场而言，必须有区域间相当水平的定期的商品（或服务）交换。,For a global market to exist there must be significant levels of regularized exchange of goods (or services) at the interregional level.
4581,在以运输成本或保护主义等形式出现的贸易壁垒大大减弱或减少的情况下，外国生产商可以和另一国家的国内生产商公平竞争。,"Where barriers to trade, either in the form of transport costs or protection, have fallen sufficiently, foreign producers from one region may compete with domestic producers in another."
4581,随着区域竞争的展开，商品供需逐渐达到全球范围：国内公司向世界供应商品，而且必须应对来自外国公司的竞争。,"As this transregional competition evolves, the demand and supply of goods increasingly operate at the global level: firms supply goods across the world and have to respond to competition from foreign firms."
4582,在教育领域，英国的思想和文化实践通过早期殖民地教育系统的制度结构扩散并且渗入到当地教育系统中去。,"In the educational field, British, or rather English, ideas and cultural practices were diffused through the institutional structure of early colonial educational systems and in their content."
4582,在全世界范围内，英国的公立学校模式和基础学校教育模式在培养地方精英的子女中被使用，而课本和课程的来源和主题总是英国的。,"Across the world, the English models of public school and grammar school education were replicated for the children of local elites, while textbooks and curriculum were invariably English in origin and subject matter."
4582,最重要的是，教育和培养的主要语言是英语。,"Above all, the main language of education and instruction was English."
4583,但是，只要我们回顾一下抵制英货或地方自治的整个纲领，部分矛盾便自然而然地化解了。这一切使得“购买印度货物”的原则 真正生效，从而有助于减少英国商品的竞争。,"Part of the contradiction disappears as we recall that the whole program of Swadeshi or local autonomy was in effect a doctrine of ""buy Indian"" and helped to cut down the competition of British goods."
4583,况且，从富裕阶级的立场来看，甘地提出的劳工自尊的原则也是有非常有利的一面。,"Furthermore, from the standpoint of the wealthy classes, there were useful aspects to Gandhi’s doctrine of the dignity of labor."
4584,与新兴工业化经济体以及其他发展中国家的贸易导致了发达经济体的生产重组而不是制选业的普遍衰落（解工业化）。,"Trade with NIEs, and other developing countries, has induced a domestic reorganization of production rather than a general decline in manufactured production (deindustrialization) within developed economies."
4584,实际上，发达国家与发展中国家的贸易是顺差，因为后者的工业化增加了对机械和其他先进产品的需求。,Indeed developed countries have a trade surplus with developing countries as the latter's industrialization increases demand for machinery and other advanced goods.
4584,全球技术扩散和新的生产商出现进一步加剧了全球竞争。所以，持续的结构调整已经变成了发达经济体的一个永久性特征。,The global diffusion of technology and the emergence of new producers have speeded up the dynamics of global competition such that continuous structural adaptation has become a permanent feature of the operation of advanced economies.
4585,现代金融市场的规模和全球扩张已加大了特定的制度风险，金融制度可能更容易受承负债务和延迟支付之苦。,The magnitude and global reach of modern financial markets have increased certain systemic risks.Financial institutions may have become more exposed to default or delayed payments.
4585,90年代借款给发展中国家使制度暴露在与70年代相同的风险之下。但还有另外的风险，各种基金日益联合起来，冲击着新兴市场的股票交易以及其他市场。,"Lending to developing countries in the 1990s exposes institutions to risks similar to those faced in the 1970s, but also to additional risks to the extent that these funds are linked increasingly to performance on emerging market stock exchanges and other markets."
4586,70年代以来，全球金融一直以指数增长，因此，当代全球金融流量和网络的广度、强度、速度和影响都是空前的。,"Since the 1970s there has been an exponential growth in global finance such that the extensity, intensity, velocity and impact of contemporary global financial flows and networks are largely unprecedented."
4586,国内金融市场和世界主要的金融中心日益植根于同一全球金融体系之中。,National financial markets and the world's key financial centres are increasingly embedded within a global financial system.
4586,在这些发展的同时，还有一个金融深化的过程。这样，几乎没有国家能将其自身置身于世界金融市场的运作之外。,"Alongside these developments there has occurred a process of financial deepening, such that few economies can insulate themselves from the daily operations of world financial markets."
4587,巨额的资本需求和周期性的大量现金盈余使跨国公司成为国际金融市场的主角。,Their huge capital demands and periodic large cash surpluses have made them key players in international financial markets.
4587,它们在贸易、金融、技术和文化全球化，以及军事技术的扩散中发挥着重要的作用，但跨国公司主要活动领域是生产和服务的国际化。,"They play a significant role in the globalization of trade, finance, technology and (through output and media ownership) culture, as well as in the diffusion of military technology.But MNCs are implicated most centrally in the internationalization of production and services activity: they can be conceived as stretching business across regions and continents."
4587,人们普遍认为跨国公司是区域和洲际间贸易的延伸。,
4588,大多数的单独债权人和借款人一样都不可能具有全球眼光。然而，世界主要金融中心之间的流量大得足以证明全球资本市场正在形成。,"Although most individual creditors, like borrowers, may not take a fully global perspective, nevertheless flows between the world's major financial centres are now sufficiently large to suggest that a global capital market is emerging."
4588,有证据表明，资本成本实际上趋于国际统一（Fukao，1993，1995）。,"There is evidence for this in the fact that the cost of capital has tended to converge internationally (Fukao, 1993, 1995)."
4589,对于潜意识的日益增加的关注也使人们对于心理学有了越来越大的兴趣。,The growing concern with the unconscious also led to greater popular interest in psychology.
4589,弗洛伊徳的思想的冲击力直到第一次世界大战之后才被完全感受到。,The full impact of Sigmund Freud’s thought was not felt until after World War I.
4589,20世纪20年代，他的观念得到了全世界的接受。,The 1920s witnessed a worldwide acceptance of his ideas.
4589,弗洛伊德的术语如潜意识、抑制、本我和自我等成为流行词汇。,"Freudian terms such as unconscious, repression, id, and ego entered the popular vocabulary."
4589,弗洛伊德理论的大众化也带来了对其理论的广泛误解，人们以为放荡不羁的性生活对于精神健康是必要的。,Popularization of Freud’s ideas led to the widespread misconception that an uninhibited sex life was necessary for mental health.
4589,尽管有着这么多误解，心理分析还是发展成为一种重要的职业，尤其是在美国。但是弗洛伊德的理念并非没有遇到挑战，有些挑战甚至直接来自他的学生。,"Psychoanalysis developed into a major profession, especially in the United States, but Freud’s ideas did not go unchallenged, even by his own pupils."
4589,最重要的一个挑战来自卡尔•荣格。,One of the most prominent challenges came from Carl Jung.
4590,鉴于世界宗教产生的影响，说它们是人类最重要的文化革新之一几乎毋庸置疑。,"In terms of their impact, there is little doubt that the world religions are among humanity’s most significant cultural innovations."
4590,世界宗教已经培育了具有巨人权力和资源的宗教精英和政治精英，他们有能力动员军队和人民，能够形成跨文化的认同感和效忠感，或者能够提供根深蒂固的神学基础和合法的社会基础。,"World religions have furnished religious and political elites with immense power and resources, be it in their capacity to mobilize armies and peoples, in their development of transcultural senses of identity and allegiance or in their provision of the entrenched theological and legal infrastructure of societies."
4590,在这些方面，世界宗教毫无疑问构成了前现代时期最强有力的和最重要的文化全球化形式，而且无论何时都的确如此。,"In these respects, world religions unquestionably constitute one of the most powerful and significant forms of the globalization of culture in the premodern era, indeed of all time."
4591,70年代，日本生产商贏得竞争并开始控制这一工业部门。同汽车工业一样，起关键作用的是它们创新的管理技术。,"In the 1970s Japanese producers achieved notable competitive success and came to dominate sectors of the industry; as with the car industry, their innovative management techniques were crucial."
4591,直到80年代中期，日本公司比美国公司更趋于国内导向： 它们保持着国内生产的相当份额，并且从国内公司索取甚多，因为它们依靠国内生产贏得竞争优势。,Until the mid-1980s Japanese firms were much more domestically oriented than US firms: they retained a greater share of production domestically and sourced more from domestic firms as they derived a competitive advantage from producing at home.
4592,1793年初，国民公会又通过一个法令宣判路易十六死刑。,"At the beginning of 1793, the Convention passed a decree condemning Louis XVI to death."
4592,1793年1月21日，国王被执行死刑，对旧制度的摧毁终于完成了。,"With his execution on January 21, 1793, the destruction of the old regime was complete."
4592,法国革命已经没有退路了。,
4592,,There could be no turning back.
4593,布雷顿森林体系体现了追求开放的全球市场的自由贸易者与追求国内繁荣和充分就业的社会民主主义者之间的妥协。,"The BWS embodied a compromise between the free traders, who desired open global markets, and the social democrats, who desired national prosperity and full employment."
4593,鲁杰将其描述成为世界贸易自由化提供证明的“复合的自由主义”。同时，它通过资本控制和固定汇率，确保政府没有必要牺牲社会保障制度和目标是完成就业和增长的宏观经济政策（1982年）。,"As Ruggie describes it, this 'embedded liberalism, provided for the liberalization of world trade while ensuring, through capital controls and fixed exchange rates, that governments did not have to sacrifice systems of social protection and macroeconomic policy geared to the achievement of domestic objectives, such as full employment and growth (1982)."
4593,这不意味着国家解除负担，不必调整国内经济政策以解决收支赤字和盈余，而意味着这种调整会逐渐发生且同国内经济优先权相符合。,"This did not mean that countries were relieved of the need to adjust domestic economic policy in response to balance of payments deficits or surpluses, but rather that adjustment could occur incrementally and in accordance with domestic economic priorities."
4594,在19世纪60年代早期，农民问题与创建一支近代军队的难题纠缠在一起。,In the early 1860s the peasant question became intertwined with the problem of creating a modern army.
4594,这个问题的解决不仅影响到日本作为一个主权国家的独立性，而且还严重地影响着日本社会的性质。,The solution to this question affected not only Japan’s independenceas a sovereign state but the very character of the society.
4594,实质上，政府不得不就是否武装农民以保卫日本抵御外敌这一问题作出决定。,In essence the government had to decide whether or not to arm the peasant in order to defend Japan against the foreign enemy.
4595,的确，列强的权力结构及其行动仍然对它们彼此的军事姿态以及所有其他国家的军事观点发挥主导性的作用，这仅仅是因为列强制定各种规则和标准。,"Indeed, the structure of power and the actions of the great powers remain dominant influences on the military postures of each other and of all other states."
4595,但是从军事技术或军事力量层次的标准来看，所有其他的国家都根据其来最终确定它们的防御能力。,"At one level this is simply because the great powers set the standards, be it in military technology or force levels, against which all other states ultimately calibrate their defence capability."
4595,因此美国的防御政策要比吉里巴斯（西太平洋群岛）的防御政策具有更大范围的全球性影响。,Thus US defence policy has more wide-ranging global effects than does that of Kiribati.
4596,在考察当代武器转移体系的特征之前，将其置于战后全球军费开支、军事能力和武器销售的主要潮流和模式这样一个大环境中来研究，或许对我们的讨论有所帮助。,"Before examining the distinctive features of the contemporary arms transfer system, it might be helpful to place this in the context of the key trends and patterns in postwar global military expenditure, military capabilities and arms sales."
4596,在1945年后，世界军费开支以相当快的速度增长，一直保持到50年代早期。60年代保持稳定不变，接着又恢复到上升的态势。,"Following demobilization in 1945, world military expenditure grew fairly rapidly until the early 1950s, stabilized until the 1960s, and then resumed an upward trajectory."
4597,英国的海军和军事力量加强了伦敦作为世界贸易和金融中心的地位（参见第3和第4章）。,British naval and military power reinforced London's position as the centre of world trade and finance (see chapters 3 and 4).
4597,然而，直到这个时候为止，没有哪一个单独的国家是居于霸权地位的。在欧洲，至少有两个强大的国家总是在争夺支配地位，并且它们经常会在殖民区域上发生利益冲突。,"However, until this moment no one single power was hegemonic; at least two powerful states were always contending for dominance in Europe itself, and their interests constantly clashed in colonial territories."
4597,此外，世界贸易的扩张还将那些非国家组织卷入了这场争夺战之中（Tilly，1990，第189页）。,"In addition, the expansion of world commerce drew non-state actors into these struggles (Tilly, 1990, p. 189)."
4598,空想社会主义者通过他们重建社会的计划吸引了一批女性支持者，她们相信只有重建社会秩序才会有助于妇女地位的改善。,"With their plans for the reconstruction of society, utopian socialists attracted a number of woman supporters who believed that only a reordering of society would help women."
4598,有一位欧文的信徒，叫做弗朗西斯•赖特的富有女性， 购买了一些奴隶，试图在田纳西州的纳绍巴建立一个模范社区。,"One of Owen's disciples, a wealthy woman named Frances Wright, bought slaves in order to set up a model community at Nashoba, Tennessee."
4598,这个社区最后失败了，但赖特仍继续为妇女的权利而奋斗。,"The community failed, but Wright continued to work for women's rights."
4599,第二次世界大战后，美国公司开风气之先，扩展其外国直接投资：50年代和60年代，外国直接投资的全部流量的至少一半来自美国。,The initial expansion of FDI in the postwar era came from US companies: in the 1950s and 1960s at least half of all FDI flows originated from the US.
4599,美洲的公司主要投资全球的采矿业和农业，特别是石油工业。,"American corporations invested in mining and agriculture around the globe, notably in the oil industry."
4599,由于拉丁美洲国家为实现工业化实施贸易保护主义，所以美国制造业跨国公司减少了出口机会，而把生产直接设在这一地区，但是投资的扩大主要是通过在欧洲和加拿大建立的海外公司实现的。,"As Latin American countries industrialized behind protectionist barriers, US manufacturing MNCs responded to reduced export possibilities by locating production in the region.But the major source of expansion was through overseas manufacturing in Europe and Canada."
4600,不管其组织形式如何，跨国公司的地理位置仍是一个重要的问题：跨国公司不能随意设置。,"Whatever their organizational form, geography still matters: MNCs cannot simply locate anywhere or everywhere."
4600,在多数部门，进入市场的机会是选择区位的重要限制和吸引跨国生产的主要刺激。在这方面，生产和销售的全球化有其自身的局限性。,"In most sectors, access to major markets is both an important constraint on location and a major incentive for multinational production; in this respect, the globalization of production and distribution has its limits."
4600,生产不可能仅仅随人的意志而组织或转移。,Production cannot be simply shifted or reorganized at will.
4601,在这个时代重要的是要把全球流动的影响——文明或者宗教之间的相遇或接触经常是一次性的——与持续的关系的影响区分开来。,It is important in this era to distinguish between the impact of global flows -- often one-off encounters or engagements between civilizations or regions -- and the impact of sustained relationships.
4601,最初的流动，如外敌入侵、皈依世界性宗教或者传染病的流行经常造成重大影响，导致现有国家的解体或混乱。,"The impact of initial flows such as external invasions, proselytizing world religions or the arrival of pandemics was often immense, resulting in the collapse or dislocation of existing states."
4601,这方面的例子包括：蛮族部落入侵拉丁欧洲，伊斯兰教最初对亚洲西南部以及北非造成的影响，黑死病对中华汉帝国的冲击以及蒙古人入侵带来的军事技术的传播。,"Examples of these flows include the barbarian invasions of Latin Europe, the initial impact of Islam on south-western Asia and North Africa, the impact of the Black Death on Han China, and the spread of military technologies across Eurasia in the wake of the Mongol invasions."
4602,合成染料的发明，使蓝靛的贸易破产了，黄麻种植只限于孟加拉和阿萨姆地区，虽然不排除有在其他地区种植黄麻的可能性。,"The discovery of synthetic dyes ruined the indigo trade.Jute was grown only in one area, Bengal and Assam, though the possibility of growing it in other places cannot be excluded."
4602,主要的限制似乎具有社会学的意义：小农经营的各种农业生产组织效率很低因为很难控制众多小农的活动；另一方面，使用奴隶或半奴隶劳动力的典型种植园，刚需要有效的压迫工具。,"The main limitation seems to be a sociological one.The agrarian variation of the putting-out system is not very efficient because it is difficult to control the practices of numerous small cultivators.On the other hand, a straightforward plantation system employing servile or semiservile labor is likely to need an efficient repressive apparatus."
4602,要想创立这种类型的大规模的种植园，则超出了英国和印度的力量，随着时间推移，要这样做变得越来越不可能了。,"To create one on any large scale was beyond British or Indian resources, increasingly so as time went on."
4603,全球殖民扩张在这个时代继续进行，但是，随着欧洲军事机器一同进入非洲和亚洲的欧洲生态系统的能力被当地更强大的免疫能力和生态资源抵消了。1492年的事件是历史上独一尤二的，然而，它使西方资本和市场需求对殖民地资源过度开采的过程开始了。例如，砍伐森林就可以追溯到19世纪晚期的爪哇和印度。与环境退化带来的地方性和国家性的影响相比较，它带来的全球性影响是有限的。,"Global colonial expansion continued in this era but the capacity of European ecology to follow the European military machine into Africa and Asia was thwarted by their more robust immunological and ecological resources.There would be no parallel to the experience of 1492.Rather, it would require the power of Western capital and market demand to begin processes of environmental overexploitation in the colonies - deforestation, for example, can be traced back to the late nineteenth century in Java and India, Once again, global environmental degradation was limited in its impact by comparison with local and national impacts."
4603,但是，帝国主义也开始辨认、研究、检查并控制地方性的环境影响（Grove，1997）。,"But imperialism too generated the first attempts to identify, study, monitor and control local environmental impacts (Grove, 1997)."
4604,浪漫主义的另一个重要特性是个人主义，它是个人所禀有的对独特个性的兴趣。,"Another important characteristic of Romanticism was individualism, an interest in the unique traits of each person."
4604,浪漫主义者顺从内心热望的冲动使他们背叛中产阶级的习惯。,The Romantics’ desire to follow their inner drives led them to rebel against middle-class conventions.
4604,长发、胡须、奇装异服更进一步强化了年轻的浪漫主义者所想要表达的个人主义特性。,"Long hair, beards, and outrageous clothes served to reinforce the individualism that young Romantics were trying to express."
4605,正象我们已经注意到的那样，这种地区的差异序列反映了历史发展的不同阶段。,"As already noted, these regional differences reflect successive stages of historical development."
4605,一些偏僻的内地村落，在西方人看来生活水准十分低下。在那些地区少数大户仍然带有某种有闲阶级的特性，比如不从事体力劳动，信奉知足者常乐的哲学，间或还抽点鸦片烟等等。,"In some remote interior villages, by accepting what would seem to Westerners an abysmally low standard of living, a few leading families could still take on some of the traits of a leisure class, such as freedom from physical labor and adherence to a philosophy of contentment, aided in some instances by opium smoking, though they fell far short of the ideal of the classically educated gentry."
4606,冷战结束以后，在欧洲以外，区域关系的制度化速度有了显著的加快，如美洲、亚太地区，以及程度稍慢的非洲。,"Since the end of the Cold War, there has been a significant acceleration in the institutionalization of regional relations beyond Europe: in the Americas, Asia-Pacific and, to a lesser degree, in Africa."
4606,但是这样的区域主义所采取的形式却与欧盟的一体化模式有着极大的差异。,But the forms taken by this regionalism are radicallydifferent from the integrationist model of the EU.
4606,实际上，当前世界其他地方大部分反对将欧盟模式作为某种直接效仿的对象。,"Indeed, to date the rest of the world has largely rejected the EU model as something to emulate directly."
4607,除了这些技术基础设施以外，许多国际机构和组织都努力寻求文化交流的全球规范。,Alongside these technological infrastructures a number of international agencies and organizations have sought some global regulation of cultural flows.
4607,它们有：那些明确涉及全球交往和文化的组织，如联合国教科文组织；全球技术基础设施的调整机构，如国际电信联盟或国际电信卫星通信机构 （参看第1.,"These include those explicitly concerned with global communications and cultures such as UNESCO, the global regulators of technological infrastructures such as the ITU or INTELSAT (see section 1."
4607,2.3节）；以及世界贸易组织，这个组织主要涉及文化保护政策问题，它对贸易自由化产生重要影响。,"2.3) and the World Trade Organization, which has become enmeshed in the issue of cultural protectionism where this impacts on the liberalization of trade."
4607,这些规范并没有阻碍交流；事实上，包括国家、区域以及全球在内的各个层次的交流继续增加。,"This regulation has not hindered communication; in fact, communication continues to increase at all levels - national, regional and global."
4608,评估通常带有相当大的推测性。,"As usual, estimates are fairly speculative."
4608,例如，在80年代初期，粮农组织认为，在未来的45年内，16%〜18%的世界热带雨林将消失。,"FAO, for example, argued at the start of the 1980s that 16-18 per cent of the world's tropical rainforest would be lost over the next forty-five years."
4608,到80年代末时，粮农组织估计的数字已经变成到2035年时将失去30%〜35%的热带雨林。,By the end of the decade this had risen to a 30 to 35 per cent loss by 2035.
4609,十月份开始新的一轮劳作，农民开始为冬播做准备。,"A new cycle began in October, when the peasants prepared the ground for planting winter crops."
4609,二三月份主要是种植春季作物：燕麦，大麦、豌豆、蚕豆、扁豆等。,"In February and March, the land was plowed for spring crops--oats, barley, peas, beans, and lentils."
4609,早夏季节农民相对清闲，但这一时期仍然有割草、剪羊毛之类的活计。,"Early summer was a comparatively relaxed time, although there was still weeding and sheepshearing to be done."
4609,每个季节里，农奴不仅要耕作自己的土地而且要为领主耕作私有地。,"In every season, serfs worked not only their own land but also the lord’s demesne."
4609,他们在自己的家庭居所旁经营小菜园，菜园中种植的蔬菜构成他们日常食物的主要来源。,They also tended the small gardens attached to their dwellings where they grew the vegetables that made up much of their diet.
4610,他们在这种情况下提出这样的议案，例如“风月法令”，仅仅是出于政治策略的动机，还是其他更多的考虑，对这一点人们的看法尚未统一。,"Whether or not the proposals they made at this time, known as the Ventose decrees,were more than a political maneuver is a question still under discussion."
4610,不过这一情况至少表明，罗伯斯庇尔和圣·鞠斯特对农民问题了解甚少，他们的提议离满足农民所表达的要求还差得很远。而这一切，作为革命的领导者，本来是应该充分了解的。,What the episode does demonstrate is that Robespierre and Saint-Just knew very little about the peasants’ problems and that their proposals fell far short of meeting demands of the peasants expressed in petitions whose general content the revolutionary leaders must have known.
4611,本书对一种变革尤其关注，它就是人类共同体随着时间的变化相互深深地卷入，尽管彼此的程度不同。,"One type of transformation has been of particular concern in this volume: the significant, albeit uneven, enmeshment of human communities with one another over time."
4611,虽然在第一个千年的后期罗马帝国和伊斯兰教的扩张无论在范围还是时间上都非常强大，但是只是在过去几百年中，世界几乎所有地区的人类共同体相互间的接触才开始逐渐正规化；人类共同体的共同命运交织在一起。,"Although the Roman Empire and the spread of Islam in the second half of the first millennium constituted formidable projections of power over space and time, it has only been in the last few hundred years that human communities have come into increasingly regularized contact with each other in nearly all regions of the world; the collective fortunes of human communities have become intertwined."
4611,这种转变及其对全球化的文明化和民主化事业的意义是最后这部分的中心。,"This shift, and its implications for the project of civilizing and democratizing globalization, are the concern of this final part of the conclusion."
4612,由于石顶极为沉重，罗马式教堂需要厚重的石柱和墙体支撑。,"Because stone roofs were extremely heavy, Romanesque churches required massive pillars and walls to hold them up."
4612,这使得窗户所占的空间被迫缩小，结果罗马式大教堂内部光线黯淡。,"This left little space for windows, making Romanesque churches quite dark inside."
4612,厚重的石墙和石柱使得罗马式教堂给人一种稳固感，这样的外形令人不禁想起城堡的样子。,The massive walls and pillars gave Romanesque churches a sense of solidity and a look reminiscent of a fortress.
4613,洛可可风格的另一特性是其装饰性风格可以很容易地应用于巴洛克式建筑之上。,Another aspect of Rococo was that its decorative work could easily be used with Baroque architecture.
4613,凡尔赛宫的建筑对欧洲有着极大的冲击。,The palace of Versailles had an enormous impact on Europe.
4613,奥地利皇帝、瑞典国王、德国亲王、意大利亲王甚至一位俄国沙皇在建筑他们的宏大宫殿时，“向波旁家族看齐”都成为他们的重要指导思想。,"""Keeping up with the Bourbons"" became important as the Austrian emperor, the Swedish king, German princes, Italian princes, and even a Russian tsar built grandiose palaces."
4614,在战后，这些官僚体制不得不处理大大增加的移民量和越来越多的各国旅游者。,In the postwar era these bureaucratic systems have had to cope with greatly increased migratory flows and a greater diversity of international travellers.
4614,长期性移民伴随着合同工人一同到来。,Permanent migrants arrive with contract workers.
4614,国际旅游、寻求避难者、留学生、探亲等也有了明显增加。,"There has been a phenomenal increase in international tourism, asylum seekers, students, family reunions, etc."
4614,这些行政规定的种类越来越多并且越来越复杂，为边境控制机构增加了工作压力。,Increasing numbers and the increasing complexity of these bureaucratic categories have strained the capacities of border control agencies.
4614,旅游者会逗留过久，留学生会在完成他们的学业后变成当地人（Zolberg，1993）。,"Tourists can overstay and students can disappear into the population after their course ends (Zolberg, 1993)."
4615,能否给上述种种差异找寻到某种统一的解释呢？马克思的少数观察推动了这一探索，魏特夫以水利控制为基础的论战性的东方专制主义理论则大大发展了这个观点。但马克思和魏特夫都不很成功的。,"The attempts to find a single comprehensive explanation of these differences, stimulated by a few offhand observations by Marx and culminating in WittfogelJs polemical conception of oriental despotism based on the control of water supplies, have not been very successful."
4615,这不是说他们搞错了方向，“水利”恐怕是一个过于狭隘的概念。,This does not mean that they are misdirected.Water supply is probably much too narrow a notion.
4615,只要中央政权承担的任务或实施的监控活动对社会运行具有决定意义，都会造成传统专制主义的崛起。,Traditional despotisms may arise where a central authority is able to perform a variety of tasks or supervise activities essential to the working of the whole society.
4615,现代的政府比早先更有可能创造出一种环境——由政府方面决定什么任务对于整个社会是至关紧要的，从而使基本民众消极被动地接受它。,In earlier times it was much less possible than it is now for a government to create situations that carry with them their own definition of what task is essential to society as a whole and make the underlying population accept it passively.
4616,社会主义和马克思主义在国际上的传播已经引起了极大的关注。这并不令人吃惊，因为这些思想是在国内被先锋队有意识地使用的，而且在国际上作为苏联的一种外交政策工具。,"The international travels of socialism and Marxism have received a great deal of attention--not surprisingly, given the conscious use of these ideas by vanguard parties domestically and as an instrument of Soviet foreign policy internationally."
4616,也许很少有人注意到，在过去两个世纪里，科学和自由话语同时从西方传播到世界的其他地方。,Less attention has perhaps been paid to the parallel diffusion of scientific and liberal discourses from the West to the rest of the world over the last two centuries.
4617,由于马歇尔计划的经济援助，西欧国家得以相对较快地从第二次世界大战的破坏中恢复过来。,"Thanks to the economic aid of the Marshall Plan, the countries of Western Europe recovered relatively rapidly from the devastation of World War II."
4617,在1947到1950年之间，欧洲国家得到了94亿美元的贷款以用于购买新设备或原材料。,"Between 1947 and 1950, European countries received $9.4 billion to be used for new equipment and raw materials."
4617,到1950年，欧洲国家的工业产量已经超过战前水平的30%。,"By 1950, industrial output in Europe was 30 percent above prewar levels."
4618,当增长重现时，它基本上是国内性的。,When growth did resume it was primarily generated domestically.
4618,初级产品出口国受打击最大：增长能够扩大对这些商品的需求，而萧条和贸易保护主义则导致需求和价格的下跌。,"Primary commodity exporters were particularly hard hit: just as growth had increased demand for these commodities, recession and protectionism led to falls in demand and, consequently, prices."
4618,价格下降促进了供给扩张，以弥补生产商的收入，而又进一步促使价格下跌。,"Falling prices encouraged an expansion of supply to make up producer incomes, pushing prices down still further."
4619,邓宁（1988）估计，第一次世界大战前夕，长期国际投资存量的35%是外国直接投资。,Dunning (1988) estimates that 35 per cent of the stock of long-term international investment on the eve of the First World War was FDI.
4619,世界外国直接投资存量的大约55%集中在初级产品部门，大约15%集中于制造业，其余的则集中于公共事业和服务业——主要是金融和贸易公司。,"Around 55 per cent of world FDI stocks were in the primary product sector, around 15 per cent in manufacturing and the rest in utilities and services - mainly banking and trading companies."
4619,外国直接投资集中在初级产品部门意味着跨国公司对全部制造业活动的一小部分份额负责。所以，国际生产的程度有限。,The concentration of FDI in primary products meant that MNCs were responsible for small shares of overall manufacturing activity such that there was only a limited degree of international production.
4620,到70年代，在几乎所有的经合发国家都建立了高度自由的贸易秩序。80年代以来，这种自由贸易秩序扩展到发展中国家，以及前苏联和东欧国家。结果是现在存在着一个全球贸易体制。,"By the 1970s a largely free trade order had been established among all the OECD countries and since the 1980s this has been extended to developing countries and countries formerly closed to trade under communism, with the result that a global trading system now exists."
4620,从历史上看，贸易保护程度低于以前时代，而贸易自由化可能会继续发展。,"Historically, protection levels are lower than in previous eras while trade liberalization is likely to continue."
4620,贸易水平无论在绝对数量上还是在占产出比例都更高。,"Trade levels are higher, both absolutely and in relation to output, than ever before."
4621,虽然不断有人尝试，例如早期的伊斯兰哈里发以及13世纪的蒙古帝国，但是这样的统治被证明是脆弱的。,"Where it was attempted -- for example, the early Islamic caliphate and the Mongol empire of the thirteenth century -- such rule proved fragile."
4621,但是在某些情况下，长距离的文化和经济网络可以维持，如跨欧亚大陆和印度洋的贸易以及横跨几大洲的伊斯兰世界。,"But in some instances cultural and economic networks were sustained over longer distances, as the trans-Eurasian and Indian ocean trades, and the cross-continental Islamic world illustrated."
4621,然而，它们的影响与军事和政治扩张的影响相比更分散、更有限。,"Their impact, however, was more diffuse and limited than that of military and political expansion."
4622,政府官僚机构日渐庞大，与此同时，围绕由谁来掌管这个官僚机构的问题导致了内部冲突和动荡。,"Although government bureaucracies grew ever larger, at the same time the question of who should control the bureaucracies led to internal conflict and instability."
4622,与地主和农奴之间的关系一样，基于土地和兵役基础上的封君与封臣之间的关系正为一种新的金钱关系所取代。,"Like the lord and serf relationship, the lord and vassal relationship based on land and military service was being replaced by a contract based on money."
4622,尤其是黑死病之后，交纳免服兵役税逐渐取代服兵役本身。,"Especially after the Black Death, money payments called scutage were increasingly substituted for military service."
4622,欧洲的君主们欢迎这一变化，因为他们可以用钱雇佣到职业军人，而且他们似乎更为可靠。,"Monarchs welcomed this development because they could now hire professional soldiers, who tended to be more reliable anyway."
4623,人们难以评估文化全球化对民族文化和认同造成的影响。,There are several difficulties in assessing the impact of cultural globalization on national cultures and identities.
4623,首先，我们必须对变化的目标持深刻的怀疑态度。,"In the first place, we must entertain serious doubts about the object of change."
4623,如果对民族经济都很难进行有意义的界定，那么，对民族文化的界定就更是如此。,"If national economies are hard enough to define meaningfully, then national cultures are doubly so."
4624,如果说瑞典在近年来已经出现了种族主义和民族主义，那么，那些公民身份模式具有较小包容性的国家有着类似的政治命运也就毫不奇怪了（Harris，1990）。,"If Sweden has seen the rise of racist nationalism in recent years it is no surprise that those states with a less inclusive model of citizenship have experienced a similar political fate (Harris, 1990)."
4624,德国和法国的战后移民过程，充满了民族认同的排斥件观念，而且，这些观念已经帮助培养起一种更持续和更强有力的极端保守主义政治。在德国，主要体现为“共和党”；在法国，主要是“人民阵线”。,"Germany and France began the process of postwar immigration with more exclusionary notions of national identity and these have helped feed a more sustained and powerful far right politics, principally Die Republikaner in Germany and the Front National in France."
4625,民族主义在19世纪的发展产生了另一个严重后果。,The growth of nationalism in the nineteenth century had yet another serious consequence.
4625,并不是所有民族都实现了建立自己国家的目标。,Not all ethnic groups had achieved the goal of nationhood.
4625,例如，巴尔干半岛上以及多元的哈布斯堡帝国中的斯拉夫少数民族创建自己的民族国家的梦想就未实现。,"Slavic minorities in the Balkans and the polyglot Habsburg empire, for example, still dreamed of creating their own national states."
4625,英国的爱尔兰人和俄国的波兰人也是如此。,So did the Irish in the British Empire and the Poles in the Russian Empire.
4626,由唯心主义者、退伍军官以及赤裸裸的恶棍们组成的帮伙集团——法西斯，以反对布尔什维主义的文明拯救者自居，他们摧毁了农村中的联盟司令部，经常纵容警察肆虐，最终于1921年在农村消灭了左翼运动。,"Presenting themselves as the saviors of civilization against Bolshevism, fasci-bands of idealists, demobilized army officers, and just plain toughs - broke up rural union headquarters, often with the connivance of the police, and during 1921 destroyed the leftist movement in the countryside."
4626,涌入法西斯阵营的农民，有爬升到中等地主位子的农民，甚至还有些憎恶联盟垄断措施的雇农。,"Among those who streamed into fascist ranks were peasants who had climbed into the middle ranks of landowners, and even tenants who hated the monopolistic practices of the unions."
4626,这年夏天，墨索里尼作出了他那有名的观察性结论：“如果法西斯主义不打算毁灭，说得更严重一点，是不打算自杀，那么，它现在就必须为自己提供一种理论……我希望在全国大会召开之前的两个月之内，法西斯主义的哲学能够创造出来。,"During the summer of this year Mussolini made his famous observation that ""if Fascism does not wish to die or, worse still, to commit suicide, it must now provide itself with a doctrine....I do wish that during the two months which are still to elapse before our National Assembly meets, the philosophy of Fascism could be created."
4626,”,’
4627,很明显，从交通方面来说，航空作为今天全球迁移的主要方式己经超越了航海运输。,"In terms of transportation, it is reasonably clear that air travel has superseded the oceangoing ship as the main means of global migration today."
4627,一些区域性迁移继续跨越大陆边界，尤其是从墨西哥向美国的迁移。,Some regional migrations continue to cross land borders-particularly the passage of people from Mexico to the USA.
4627,然而，尽管交通方式还没有发生变化，但是确实促进了移民向某些重要地区如航空港、某些城市等的集中。,"However, shifts in types of transportation have not altered, indeed they may have enhanced, the concentrations of migration flows through key points-airports, certain cities, etc."
4628,直接隶属于将军等级的较小单位是大封建主或称大名。在1614年他们共有194名，到王政复古前的1868年也只不过有266名。,Directly beneath the Shogun in rank came.the small body of great lords or daimyo.There were 194 of them in 1614 and only 266 immediately before the Restoration of 1868.
4628,到了后来，最大的藩所产的稻米达1，022，700（石），而一般的采邑大约是70，000（石）。,"At the latter date the largest fief was registered as producing 1,022,700 koku of rice."
4629,法国大革命的爆发打破了一切改革的希望。,The outbreak of the French Revolution put an end to all hope of reform.
4629,更为特别的是一旦法国革命越过了其自由主义的阶段（即当路易十六逃往瓦伦尼兹，而他的重新被捕撕去了自由前景的“幻想面纱”时，法国革命开始进入了一个激进主义阶段），英国的那些同情革命的人发觉自己处于越来越尴尬的地位。,"More specifically, as soon as the Revolution passed beyond its liberal phase, when Louis XVITs flight to Varennes and recapture ""tore the veil of illusions"" from liberal prospects and the Revolution began to enter a radical phase, those in England who sympathized with it found their position more and more awkward."
4629,小皮特终止了一切有关改革的讨论，英国开始进入一个限制自由的时期。,Pitt the Younger stopped all talk of reform.
4629,这个时期一直持续到拿破仑战争以后。,England began to enter a phase of repression that lasted until after the Napoleonic Wars.
4629,这种局面的实质性特征在于城市和农村的上层阶级紧密团结在这样一个爱国而又保守的口号之下：反对法国激进主义和暴戾统治，反对法国革命对他们的特权可能造成的威胁。,"Its fundamental feature was that the upper classes, in both the town and the countryside, closed ranks around patriotic and conservative slogans against the menace of radicalism and tyranny in France and against the remotest threat to their privileges."
4630,正如比尔德接着指出的：内战本身使激进派运动的潜伏期缩短了。,"The Civil War itself, as he remarks a few sentences later, cut short the drift to radicalism."
4630,内战前，西部土地究竟对东部的工人有多大益处，仍然是一个值得争论的问题。,And just how much help Western land may have been to the Eastern workingman before the Civil War remains a very open question.Already speculators were getting their hands on big chunks of it.
4630,投机者们获得了大部分土地，可东部城市的穷人却似乎不大可能离开矿井或工厂去买下一块地，然后用一些简单工具把它装备起来开始耕种，并从中获利。即使看到其他人可能会这样做，他扪也不会离开城市来到西部。,"Nor is it likely that the really poor in Eastern cities could leave the mine shaft and the factory bench to buy a small farm, equip it even with simple tools, and run it profitably, even if they benefited from the prospect that others might be able to do so."
4631,另一方面，一定的集体形式的生产活动对于贫苦农民来说是很重要的。,"On the other hand, certain collectivist practices were important to poor peasants."
4631,其中最有价值的是公用土地的权力，在耕地上，这种权力是古代使用荒地习惯所形成的制度的一部分，而这种习惯制度在法国还没有圈地运动时流行。,The most valuable was the right of vaine pature.On cultivated territory this right was part of the ancient open-field system that prevailed through much of France iIi the absence of a powerful movement toward enclosures.
4631,这些耕地大都呈条形状，围绕着作为住所的村庄。,"The cultivated fields lay in strips, surrounding the cluster of dwellings that was the village."
4632,这种观念变化的最显著的标志之一，是土地市场的繁荣。这种繁荣大约从1580年开始，并整整延续了近半个世纪。,One of the most striking signs of the changed outlook was a boom in the land market that began around 1580 and lasted for about half a century.
4632,土地的年租用费达到了几十年前土地出售价的三分之一。,Annual rentals climbed to a third of what estates had sold for a few decades earlier.
4632,如果没有农业生产结构方面的变化，就可能不会出现这种繁荣。因此，这可以被解释为生产结构变化的结果。,Such a boom would be most unlikely without far-reaching structural changes in the conduct of agriculture itself and may be interpreted as a consequence of these changes.
4633,英格兰便是这样的例子。,"Such, for example, was the case in England."
4633,当君主专制在法国、德国大部地区和俄国如火如荼地发展时，它却在英国的土地上第一次碰了壁。毫无疑问，这里企图建立君主专制的动力不够强大。,"While absolutism was growing stronger in France, in a large section of Germany, and in Russia, it met its first major check on English soil, where to be sure the attempt to establish it was much feebler."
4633,这种状况的出现，主要是由于英国的土地贵族早就赋有了商业特征。,In very large measure this was true because the English landed aristocracy at an early date began to acquire commercial traits.
4633,土地贵族是否转向农业商品经济，是决定尔后政治进程的最关键的因素。如果他们能够实现这种转化，那么商品经济化就将大功告成。,"Among the most decisive determinants influencing the course of subsequent political evolution are whether or not a landed aristocracy has turned to commercial agriculture and, if so, the form that this commercialization has taken."
4634,许多拉哥尼亚人变成了波瑞奥科，即自由民，而不是要向斯巴达纳税和服兵役的市民。,"Many Laconians became periokoi, free inhabitants but not citizens who were required to pay taxes and perform military service for Sparta."
4634,也有拉哥尼亚人成为了黑劳士（此词源于希腊语“捕获”）。,Other Laconians became helots (the name is derived from a Greek word for “capture”).
4634,他们被束缚在土地上，被迫耕田或者给斯巴达人做家奴。,They were bound to the land and forced to work on farms and as household servants for the Spartans.
4635,欧洲人奴役非洲人的历史至少可以追溯到15世纪50年代，那时，沿着非洲海岸航行的葡萄牙航海员开始给欧洲正在出现的家庭奴隶市场提供货源。,The European enslavement of Africans can be dated back to at least the 1450s when Portuguese sailors travelling the coast of Africa began supplying an emerging European market for house slaves.
4635,但是，正是美洲和加勒比海地区殖民地以及种植经济的建立为奴隶贸易的扩张提供了决定性的经济推动力。,But it was the establishment of American and Caribbean colonies and plantation economies that provided the decisive economic push in the expansion of the slave trade.
4635,到18世纪开始时，随着欧洲、非洲和美洲之间的三角关系发展成制成品、劳动力和农产品的正常商品循环圈，葡萄牙人被英同人赶上了，而且法国人和荷兰人也成为竞争对手。,"By the beginning of the eighteenth century the Portuguese were overtaken by the British, and squeezed by the French and Dutch, as the triangular relationship between Europe, Africa and the Americas was developed into a routine circuit of commodity exchange of manufactured goods, labour and agricultural produce."
4636,资本家们并不反对购买奴隶生产的产品，只要它们通过加工能再销售出去。,Capitalists had no objection to obtaining goods produced by slavery as long as a profit could be made by working them up and resellfig them.
4636,从严格主义上的经济观点来看，雇佣劳动与奴隶制之间，正象存在很多矛盾一样，也冋样存在着很多发展贸易和政治关系的潜力。,"From a strictly economic standpoint, wage labor and plantation slavery contain as much of a potential for trading and complementary political relationships as for conflict."
4636,到这里，我们对于前面提出的问题可姑且作一个否定的回答:从理论上笼统地来说，南、北之间没有什么理由非发动那场战争不可。,We can answer our question with a provisional negative: there is no abstract general reason why the North and South had to fight.
4637,实际上，这些地区的文明相互之间依然来往极少，自己培育的农作物以及发明的技术传播缓慢或者限于一隅就是最好的证明。,"In fact, the civilizations of these regions remained pretty much separate from each other, as witnessed by the very slow or nonexistent diffusion of domesticated crops and technologies."
4637,虽然欧亚大陆与撒哈拉沙漠以南非洲大陆也有些交往、往来和关系，但是沙漠把这些地区分离开来，就像海洋之与两个美洲一样。,"While some contacts, flows and relationships existed between Eurasia and sub-Saharan Africa, the desert proved almost as effective in separating these regions as the oceans were in separating them all from the Americas."
4637,伊斯兰文化、穿越沙漠的小型贸易驼队以及跨印度洋的贸易合同使非洲文明与欧亚大陆上的文明有了接触。,"Islamic culture, small camel-trading routes across the desert and trading contacts across the Indian Ocean brought African civilizations into contact with Eurasia."
4638,政府和国际机构在当代全球金融市场的发展中起了巨大的作用。,Governments and international authorities have played a catalytic role in the growth of contemporary global financial markets.
4638,一些国内当局允许甚至鼓励它们的发展，尽管其他许多国家抵制它们。,"Some national authorities permitted, even encouraged, their growth; although many others discouraged or resisted it."
4638,如前所述，60年代欧洲货币贸易的增长在一定程度上避免了美国资本控制。,"As noted previously, the Eurocurrency business grew in the 1960s partly to avoid US capital controls."
4639,实际上，布雷顿森林体系（从1958年的自由货币兑换到1971年的终止）仅持续了13年。虽然是在金融更整合的体制内，欧洲货币体制有效地实行了14年（1979年〜1993年），这是一种更小的体制，主要货币之间的联盟更频繁。,"The BWS in effect lasted only thirteen years, from free current account convertibility in 1958 to its demise in 1971; while the EMS - a smaller system, with more frequent realignments among the major currencies - effectively lasted only fourteen years (1979-93), albeit in a much more financially integrated system."
4639,因此，在金融全球化条件下，对汇率管理的不同战略的可行性和效果还不能作明确结论。,Thus definitive statements about the effectiveness and feasibility of different strategies for exchange rate management under conditions of financial globalization are likely to be overhasty.
4640,加拿大试图控制美国文化产业在加拿大媒体和电信产业中所占份额——阻止美国文化产业兼并加拿大某些产业，而且为阻止某些兼并而违反北美自由贸易协定规定。,Canada has attempted to control the degree to which US culture industries can take a stake in Canadian media and telecommunications industries - blocking some takeovers and contravening NAFTA regulations to do so.
4640,90年代早期欧美之间的贸易谈判陷入僵局，美国要求有一个更自由的文化产品市场，而许多欧洲国家要求有进口限制、国家配额和对民族文化产业进行广泛的国家资助。,"Trade negotiations in the early 1990s were bedevilled by US demands for a much freer market in cultural products, while many European nations argued for import limits, national quotas and extensive state aid to national cultural industries."
4640,欧洲议会内部以及整个欧盟的类似谈判也总是失败。,These arguments have also been played out inside the Council of Europe and throughout the European Union.
4641,按照传统，欧洲债券持有者被喻为力图避免自己财产被征税的比利时牙医。,According to legend the typical holder of a Eurobond is a Belgian dentist anxious to prevent his savings from being taxed.
4641,实际上，这些资产主要由机构投资人持有，特别是养老基金。,"In fact assets are mainly held by institutional investors, notably pension funds."
4641,跨国公司在现金剩余时代常常既是债券的主要发行人，又是主要的购买者。,"As well as being major issuers of bonds, multinational corporations are often significant purchasers during periods of cash surplus."
4642,以上描述的农民叛乱证明，在从近代以前的土地制度向新的制度过渡中，各地普遍存在着反抗。,The peasant revolts described above document the existence of more than scattered resistance to the transition from the premodern agrarian system to a new one.
4642,它们反映了农村向资本主义和商业化经营转变过程中所通常遇到的困难。,They reflect many of the usual difficulties of the changeover to capitalism and commercial farming in the countryside.
4642,那么，为什么这些困难显得并不那么严重?,Why were they not more serious?
4642,要回笞这个问題就必须深入地考察农村社会经历的变化.,For an answer to that question it is necessary to examine rural society more closely and the changes it underwent.
4643,国际联盟的虚弱，以及美国和英国双双背誓不肯与法国结成防御性同盟，使得法国备感苦楚和孤独。,The weakness of the League of Nations and the failure of both the United States and Great Britain to honor their promises to form defensive military alliances with France left France embittered and alone.
4643,法国在1919至1924年间寻求安全的努力主要是建立在严格执行《凡尔赛和约》之上的。,France’s search for security between 1919 and 1924 was founded primarily on a strict enforcement of the Treaty of Versailles.
4643,这一针对德国的严苛政策始于赔偿条款，要求德国支付赔款，以补偿“对协约国与其盟国的人民及财产所造成的损失”，就如和约中所说。,"This tough policy toward Germany began with the issue of reparations, the payments that the Germans were to make to compensate for the ‘‘damage done to the civilian population of the Allied and Associated Powers and to their property,’’ as the treaty asserted."
4643,1921年4月 ，协约国的赔款委员会确定了德国的赔款数额为1320亿马克（330亿美元），以每年赔偿25亿金马克的方式来支付。,"In April 1921, the Allied Reparations Commission settled on a sum of 132 billion marks ($33 billion) for German reparations, payable in annual installments of 2.5 billion (gold) marks."
4643,新成立的德意志共和国在1921年支付了第一笔赔款，但是第二年德国遭遇了严重的金融危机，宣布无力支付赔款。,"The new German republic made its first payment in 1921, but by the following year, facing financial problems, it announced that it was unable to pay more."
4643,法国政府认为这是德国对于和平安排的侵犯，被激怒了，于是派兵占领了德国主要的工业和矿业中心鲁尔区。,"Outraged by what it considered Germany’s violation of the peace settlement, the French government sent troops to occupy the Ruhr valley, Germany’s chief industrial and mining center."
4643,因为德国不能支付赔款，法国将通过控制鲁尔区的工厂和开掘矿山来自行收集赔款。,"Because the Germans would not pay reparations, the French would collect reparations in kind by operating and using the Ruhr mines and factories."
4644,公元前133年，贵族出身的提比略・格拉古出任保民官。他认识到，罗马社会问题的根源在于小农的衰落。,"In 133 B.C., Tiberius Gracchus, himself a member of the aristocracy and a new tribune, came to believe that the underlying cause of Rome’s problems was the decline of the small farmer."
4644,由于格拉古知道他的竞争对手会反对他的提议，他避开元老院，在平民会议通过了一项土地改革法案，法案批准政府收回大地产者拥有的土地，把它们分给无地的罗马人。,"Consequently, Tiberius bypassed the senate, where he knew his rivals would oppose his proposal, and had the council of the plebs pass a land reform bill that authorized the government to reclaim public land held by large landowners and to distribute it to landless Romans."
4645,这一伟大的宗教运动从其诞生地反常地消失的一个原因是，它未能为应付通常的生活中的危机作好准备，未能为出生、结婚、去世和俗人生活中其他一些关键性的转变提供种种仪式。,"One reason for the decline of Buddhism at home was that it failed to provide for the usual crises of life.It offered no ceremonies for birth, marriage, death, and other critical turns in the lives of the laity."
4645,对比之下，婆罗门则准备好自己的种种礼仪。尽管受到改革者们的攻击，这一事实保证他们却仍能生存下去。,"By contrast the Brahmans were ready with their rites, and their survival was assured despite the attacks of the reformers."
4645,此外更重要的是，婆罗门也从事自身改革。,"More important, the Brahmans themselves embraced reform."
4645,他们在富于哲理性的经典《奥义书》中，提出了通向自由和解放的道路。,"In their philosophical texts, the Upanishads, they set forth their own paths to moshka—to freedom and release."
4646,在地主阶级领导下，他们的前进道路基本铺平扫清。,"Under the leadership of the landed classes, much of the road had been smoothed for them."
4646,19世纪的英国资本家不必依靠普鲁士的容克地主来实现国家的统一。他们扫除了内部阻碍贸易的障碍，确立了统一的法律制度，以及现代货币制度和其它工业化的必要条件。,"The English capitalists in the nineteenth century did not have to rely on a Prussia and its Junkers to achieve national unity, tear down the internal barriers to trade, establish a uniform legal system, modern currency, and other prerequisites of industrialization."
4646,政治秩序开始合理化，现代型国家在不长的时间里诞生了。,The political order had been rationalized and a modern state created long before.
4646,作为完全资本主义化了的资产阶级，他们只需从这样的国家中获得极小的帮助，就能把整个地球的大部分地区变为自己的贸易市场。,"With a minimum of help from that state they could, as the first fully capitalist bourgeoisie, convert a large part of the entire globe into their trading area."
4647,如前面所说，把全球化理解为一个单一世界或者共同体形式是完全错误的，把全球化与“普世主义”联系在一起也是一样，因为全球显然不是宇宙的同义词。对于所有的民族或共同体来说，它们经历的全球相互联系程度不同，而且方式也不同。,"As previously noted, the notion of globalization as the precursor to a single world society or community is deeply flawed.So too is the association of globalization with 'universalism' for clearly the global is not a synonym for the universal; global interconnectedness is not experienced by all peoples or communities to the same extent or even in the same way."
4647,从这个角度也要把全球化与趋同区别开来，因为全球化不认为同质化和和谐不断增强。,"In this respect, it is also to be distinguished from convergence since it does not presume growing homogeneity or harmony."
4647,相反，正如布尔和布赞两人所说，相互联系的不断加强既是强烈冲突（而不是合作）的根源，也是共同忧虑和深刻敌意的结果（Bull，1977；Buzan，1991）。,"On the contrary, as both Bull and Buzan have argued, growing interconnectedness may be both a source of intense conflict (rather than cooperation) as well as a product of shared fears and deeply held animosities (Bull, 1977; Buzan, 1991)."
4648,70年代，日本生产商贏得竞争并开始控制这一工业部门。同汽车工业一样，起关键作用的是它们创新的管理技术。,"In the 1970s Japanese producers achieved notable competitive success and came to dominate sectors of the industry; as with the car industry, their innovative management techniques were crucial."
4648,直到80年代中期，日本公司比美国公司更趋于国内导向：它们保持着国内生产的相当份额，并且从国内公司索取甚多，因为它们依靠国内生产赢得竞争优势。,Until the mid-1980s Japanese firms were much more domestically oriented than US firms: they retained a greater share of production domestically and sourced more from domestic firms as they derived a competitive advantage from producing at home.
4649,在1973年，向经合组织成员国申请避难的总人数是2.5万人。,"In 1973, the total number of asylum applications in the OECD was 25,000."
4649,1990年，这一数字达到了近55万，从1983-1990年累计总数是220万人。,"In 1990, it had reached an annual level of almost 550,000.The cumulative total from 1983 to 1990 is 2.2 million people."
4649,目前的迁移趋势表明，由于在同一时期西方国家加紧了对移民的法律限制，因此，在不久的将来，寻求避难者的数量将超过自愿移民者的数量。,"Coupled with the tightening of immigration laws in the West over the same period, current trends suggest that at some point in the near future the number of asylum seekers will exceed the number of voluntary migrants presenting themselves at the borders of OECD countries."
4650,在第二次世界大战结束时，美国通过了一系列限制性移民法律以及更多的限制性战时措施。,At the end of the Second World War the USA had in place a variety of restrictive immigration laws passed in the interwar years as well as more restrictive wartime measures.
4650,为了安置约20万居住在美围的移民和难民，这些法规和措施在40年代晚期有所松动。,"These were relaxed somewhat in the late 1940s to accommodate some 200,000 displaced persons and refugees who settled in the USA."
4650,然而，为限制迁移总量，在50年代又逋过了更为严格的限制性法律 （Riemers，1985; Portes和1985; Borjas，1990）。,"Further restrictive legislation was passed in the 1950s, seeking both to limit the overall total of immigration and restrict it as far as possible to Northern Europeans by the imposition of country- specific and hemispheric quotas (Riemers, 1985; Portes and Bach, 1985; Borjas, 1990)."
4651,同时，在富饶的伊斯兰新月状地区、阿拉伯半岛、印度的海滨城市国家，非洲的各个王国以及阿拉伯人在非洲东海岸的货物集散地之间，海上贸易网络也兴盛起来。,"Over the same period, seaborne networks of trade flourished between the Islamic lands of the fertile crescent and Arabia, the coastal city-states of India, African kingdoms and Arab entrepots on the east coast of Africa."
4651,在14世纪和15世纪早期，这些贸易网络直接与中国联系在一起。因此，在现代之前，贸易网络已将欧洲、亚洲和非洲连接在一起（Abu-Lughod，1989; Chaudhuri， 1985; Snow， 1988））。,"In the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries these trade networks connected directly with China itself so that in the premodern era trading networks had developed linking Europe, Asia and Africa (Abu-Lughod, 1989; Chaudhuri, 1985; Snow, 1988)."
4652,它们还使图像和实物可以以更大的强度、更大的量和更快的速度长距离运动。,"They allow for the movement of images and objects over enormous distances with greater intensity, volumeand speed."
4652,它们使遥远地区之间的互动的成本越来越低而且越来越容易。它们还有助于社会生活中符号密度（symbolic density）的增加。,They have made interaction between distant places cheaper and easier.They have also contributed to an increase in the symbolic density of social life.
4653,国王的宗教政策证明也是灾难性的。,The king’s religious policy also proved disastrous.
4653,査理试图给国教强加更多的仪式，这一点代表了向天主教会的回归，打击了清教徒。,His attempt to impose more ritual on the Anglican church struck the Puritans as a return to Catholic popery.
4653,査理决心迫使他们遵从他的宗教政策，这激怒了清教徒，结果成千上万的英格兰人离开本土远赴美洲的“偏僻荒原”。,"Charles’s efforts to force them to conform to his religious policies infuriated the Puritans, thousands of whom abandoned England for the ""howling wildernesses"" of America."
4654,关于内战本身已无需赘述，特别是在提到最重要的政治事件——《解放宣言》以后。,"About the Civil War itself, it is unnecessary to say more than a few words, especially since the most important political event, the Emancipation Proclamation, has already been mentioned."
4654,这场战争反映出这样一种情况:美国社会的统治阶级鲜明地分为两派。这种分裂比清教徒革命时期的英国统治阶级内部分歧和法国革命时期法国统治阶级之间的分歧更为鲜明。,"The war reflected the fact that the dominant classes in American society had split cleanly in two, much more cleanly than did the ruling strata in England at the time of the Puritan Revolution or those in France at the time of the French Revolution."
4654,在英法两国的大动荡中，统治阶级的分裂使下层社会出现了激进的行动，在法国尤其如此。,"In those two great convulsions, divisions within the dominant classes enabled radical tendencies to boil up from the lower strata, much more so in the case of the French Revolution than in England."
4654,在美国内战中始终没有出现象法国那么激进的革命高潮。,In the American Civil War there was no really comparable radical upsurge.
4655,在欧洲之外，亚洲（在东南亚国家联盟内）、非洲和拉丁美洲等地区在安全制度的全球化和区域化方向上也取得类似的发展。,"Beyond Europe, too, there are similar developments in the direction of the globalization and regionalization of security regimes in Asia (within ASEAN), Africa (OAU) and Latin America (OAS)."
4655,在东南亚国家联盟之内，东盟地区论坛为亚太地区国家和主要的全球性强国（比如美国和欧洲）之间就区域安全事务构建了一个正在发展的协商性协定（Leifer，1996）；正如西内里所说，它意味着亚太地区向安全合作和多边对话的制度化迈出了重要的崭新的一步。,"Within ASEAN, the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) constitutes an evolving consultative arrangement between the Asia-Pacific nations and key global powers such as the US and EU in respect of regional security affairs (Leifer, 1996).As Snyder observes, it represents an important and novel step towards the institutionalization of security cooperation and multilateral dialogue in the Asia-Pacific (1996)."
4655,但是这种趋势是不均衡发展的，它被一些地区国际社会非常脆弱的规范以及存在的区域对抗和状态削弱了。,But this trend is quite unevenly experienced and it is moderated by the weak norms of international society in some regions as well as existing regional rivalries and enmities.
4656,从那时起，拉丁美洲移民模式表现在3个方面。,Since then the pattern of Latin American migration has been threefold.
4656,第一，向北的迁出规模——不管是合法还是非法的——以及主要向美国（尤其是来自墨西哥和中美洲）的迁移规模有了稳步上升；第二，向南欧的迁移规模小得多；第三，区域性移民的次数不断增加。,"First, there has been a steady increase in the levels of northwards emigration, legal and illegal, and principally to the USA (especially from Mexico and Central America).Second, there has been a much smaller flow of migrants to Southern Europe.Third, a growing array of regional migrations has occurred."
4656,在哥伦比业和委内瑞拉之间以及在玻利维亚、智利、巴拉圭和阿根廷之间开始出现季节性的农业迁移，其中许多是来自加勒比海地区的非法劳工。,"Seasonal, agricultural migrations have been initiated between Colombia and Venezuela as well as between Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and Argentina.Many of these are illegal migrations drawing on the Caribbean."
4657,亚太经合组织（APEC），正如人们所知道的，最初被认为是“四个形容词寻找一个名词”。,"APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation), as it is known, was initially regarded as four adjectives in search of a noun'."
4657,但是自其成立以来，其成员已扩展到包括这一地区的所有的主要国家，并且它已经成立了各种工作组织和政府间的网络，其目的是为了扩展地区内部的自由贸易与资本自由化。,But since its inception membership has expanded to include all the major states in the region and it has spawned a vast array of working groups and intergovernmental networks for the purposes of extending free trade and capital liberalization within the region.
4657,亚太经合组织由定期的各个关键政策领域的部长会议及旨在制定地区议程的年度国家首脑最高会议领导，由设在新加坡的一个很小的秘书处为其提供服务，亚太经合组织代表着在亚太地区的一种“新区域主义”，尽管被限制在经济事务中，伹它正逐渐演变为一种多边合作的重要的制度化论坛（“开放的区域域主义”），而不是区域性的政治整合（“封闭的区域主义”），（Ravenhill， 1998）。,"APEC is guided by regular ministerial meetings across a range of key policy domains, and annual summit meetings of heads of state which seek to set the regional agenda.Serviced by a small secretariat in Singapore, APEC represents a 'new regionalism' in the Asia-Pacific which, although restricted to economic matters, is evolving into a significant institutionalized forum for multilateral cooperation ('open regionalism') rather than regional political integration ('closed regionalism') (Ravenhill, 1998)."
4658,法国人在两方面掀起了民族主义：一方面，法国人自己变成了被人憎恨的压迫者，结果激起了其他国家人民反对法国民族主义的爱国热情，另一方面，法国人也让欧洲人认识到什么是民族主义，并认识到一个武装起来的民族所具有的巨大力量。,"The French aroused nationalism in two ways: by making themselves hated oppressors, and thus arousing the patriotism of others in opposition to French nationalism, and by showing the people of Europe what nationalism was and what a nation in arms could do.The lesson was not lost on other peoples and rulers."
4658,法国以外的各国人民和统治者很好地学到了这些。,
4658,英国支持下的西班牙境内的反拿破仑起义就将一支20万人的法国军队拖住了数年。,"A Spanish uprising against Napoleon’s rule, aided by British support, kept a French force of 200,000 pinned down for years."
4659,尽管我们承认环境退化通常具有空间有限性的特征，但是，我们认为，在导论中阐述的框架可以被有效地应用于解释环境退化和环境威胁产生的社会原因和带来的社会后果。,"While we acknowledge the often spatially restricted character of environmental degradation, we argue that the framework specified in the introduction can usefully be applied to the spatial characteristics of the social origins and consequences of environmental degradation and environmental threats."
4659,我们在3种环境问题之间作了区分：全球环境公共品；人口、资源和人口过剩问题；以及有意或无意的，实际或潜在的跨国污染问题。,"We distinguish between three types of environmental problem: the global commons; the problems of demography, resources and overspill; and transboundary pollution both unintentional and intentional as well as actual or threatened."
4659,我们还将全球化方法运用到那些努力跟踪和控制环境退化面作出的政治与文化反应上。,We also apply the measure of globalization to those political and cultural responses that seek to track and regulate environmental degradation.
4660,比较而言，今天大部分的世界制造业出口由跨国公司控制着。,"By comparison, today MNCs account for the majority of the world's manufacturing exports."
4660,假定国际投资的增长源自分支机构和分包商，那么，随着跨国公司将其生产过程向国际扩展，半成品（未完成的商品）已有所增加（见OECD，1994a，第5章）。,"Given increased international sourcing from both affiliates and subcontractors, trade in intermediate products (unfinished goods) has risen as MNCs stretch the production process transnationally (see OECD, 1994a, ch. 5)."
4660,由此跨国公司通过公司内贸易创造了全新的全球劳动分工，因为它能在世界范围内组织生产，以充分利用较低的生产成本或特殊的国内竞争条件。,"MMCs are thereby creating a new global division of labour, through intrafirm trade, as production is organized worldwide to take advantage of lower production costs or particular national competitive conditions."
4661,在牢记这些警告的同时，6.2节描述了直到第二次世界大战结束时的人类迁移的范围和形式。,"With these caveats in mind, section 6.2 sketches the scope and form of human migrations up to the end of the Second World War."
4661,我们从考察前现代迁移开始，它为理解后来的发展提供了背景。,We start by exploring premodern migrations which provide a context for understanding later developments.
4661,然后，我们集中关注欧洲帝国的全球扩张及其创造的全球经济互动。,"We then focus on the global expansion of European empires, and the global economic interactions they created."
4661,我们认为，这些帝国是与更早时期完全不同的全球迁移时代的基础。,"These empires, we argue, formed the basis of an era of global migration that was systematically different from earlier periods."
4661,这也就是说，在1500~1945年之间的全球迁移时代并不是均衡的。,"That said, the era of global migrations between 1500 and 1945 was not uniform."
4662,日益增长的贸易意味着国内市场联系趋于紧密，某些商品的全球市场开始出现。,Growing trade meant that domestic markets became increasingly linked and global markets for some goods emerged.
4662,像大米和小麦这样的初级产品有了正式的全球市场。大量的初级产品通过欧洲和美国已有的交易中心进行交易，并为整个世界设定了基本价格（Latham， 1986）。,"For certain primary commodities, such as rice and wheat, formal global markets were instituted: large volumes of these commodities were traded through established centres in Europe and the US, setting benchmark prices for the entire world (Latham, 1986)."
4663,全球政治和全球治理的制度化已经不仅仅限于政府和国家活动的国际化。,The institutionalization of global politics and global governance is not restricted to the internationalization of governmental and state activities.
4663,伴随后者出现了经济、公民社会和国内团体的相应跨国化。,"Alongside the latter can be charted a corresponding transnationalization of economies, civil societies and national communities."
4663,在几乎每一个社会活动的领域，从经济到文化，都可以见到跨国关系网络的国际化。也就是说，这些关系和活动超越了国家边界的界线。,"In almost every sphere of social activity, from the economic to the cultural, there has been a significant institutionalization of transnational relations and networks - that is, those relations and activities cutting across national territorial boundaries."
4664,如今，电信网络已经涵盖了每个国家，尽管它还没有涵盖世界大多数的人口。,"Today's global telecommunications network embraces every country, although not yet significant sections of the world's population."
4664,它像许多其他全球网络一样，反映了权力和特权的地域性。产生于发达资本主义世界的私人间的、超越地域的电话和传真服务在许多地方仍旧无法实现。,"It reflects, like many other global networks, the geography of power and privilege; the person-to-person, or point-to-point, international telephonic or fax service found in the advanced capitalist world is not yet available in many places."
4665,此外，最近的发展表明，东亚各共同体正在世界主要地区相互联系不断加强的背景下发展着。,"In addition, the communities of East Asia, as recent developments show, are developing in the context of growing interconnectedness across the world's major regions."
4665,这种相互联系遍及所有领域，从环境、人权、贸易与金融到国际犯罪，东亚地区各共同体在共同问题上命运与共。,"This interconnectedness is marked in a whole range of areas from the environment, human rights, trade and finance, to issues of international crime.There are emerging overlapping communities of fate generating common problems within and across the East Asian region."
4665,换句话说，东亚必然成为全球秩序的一部分，而且被卷入各种力量之中，其命运受到后者的影响和决定。,"In other words, East Asia is necessarily part of the global order and is locked into a diversity of sites of power which shape and determine its fortunes."
4666,根据日耳曼习惯法，在判定被告者是否有罪或者应否支付人身赎金时，立誓免罪和神判法是两个使用最普遍的程序。,"Under German customary law, compurgation and the ordeal were the two most commonly used procedures for determining whether an accused person was guilty and should have to pay wergeld."
4666,立誓免罪就是被告者在一群20或者25个 “宣誓帮助者”的支持下进行宣誓，他们也要宣誓被告是可以信任的。,"Compurgation was the swearing of an oath by the accused person, backed up by a group of ""oath helpers,"" numbering twelve or twenty-five, who would also swear that the accused person should be believed."
4666,神判法有多种作用，都是基于神的介入；神（不论是异教徒还是基督徒）都不允许无辜的人受伤害（见附文）。,"The ordeal functioned in a variety of ways, all of which were based on the principle of divine intervention; divine forces (whether pagan or Christian) would not allow an innocent person to be harmed (see the box on p. 122)."
4667,美国在一定程度上跨越了这些趋势。,America stands somewhat astride of these trends.
4667,从美国诞生之日起，种族划分和民族认同就是一个有争议的领域。,Ethnicity and national identity have been a contested terrain since the inception of the USA.
4667,而且，由于新的移民浪潮以及60年代出现的一浪高过一浪的公民权抗议运动，美国旧的主张社会化的熔炉式认同模式开始被拋弃。,"Moreover, the rejection of the older assimilationist melting-pot model of American identity was initiated not by new waves of immigration but by the explosive protests of the civil rights movement in the 1960s."
4668,萨摩藩的叛乱表明，迫使武士摆脱封建浪漫主义的束缚并不是件容易的事。,"As the Satsuma Rebellion shows, it was not easy to shed feudal romanticism."
4668,不过这还是有可能的，以后也确实实现了。,But it could be done and was done.
4668,另一方面，对于受古典训练的中国士大夫来说，近代技术又有什么用处呢?,"On the other hand, what; earthly use was modern technology to the classically trained Chinese scholar official?"
4669,当然，奴隶贸易数量如此惊人的一个原因在于高死亡率。,"One reason for the astonishing numbers of slaves, of course, was the high death rate."
4669,从非洲通往美洲的奴隶贩卖旅程是著名的中间通道，是大西洋三角贸易区的一段核心航程。,"The arduous journey of slaves from Africa to the Americas became known as the Middle Passage, the middle leg of the triangular trade route."
4669,非洲奴隶被秘密地塞进货船里，每船大约300—450人，而且用铁链锁在狭小的空间内，没有厕所，甚至站立的空间都没有；在整个通向美洲的航海途中都一直如此。而这至少要100天的时间（见附文）。,"African slaves were closely packed into cargo ships, 300 to 450 per ship, and chained in holds without sanitary facilities or enough space to stand up; there they remained during the voyage to America, which took at least 100 days (see the box on p. 268)."
4669,死亡率平均高达10%，由于暴风雨或者逆风航行导致的航行时间延长会带来更高的死亡率。,Mortality rates averaged 10 percent; longer journeys due to storms or adverse winds resulted in even higher death rates.
4669,幸存下来的非洲人还要遭受对他们来说几乎毫无免疫力的高致病率疾病的威胁。,The Africans who survived the journey were subject to high death rates from diseases to which they had little or no immunity.
4670,尽管沙龙是由女性所主持的，但沙龙的声望却依赖于女主人所能吸引来的男性的水平。,"Although the salons were run by women, the reputation of a salon depended on the stature of the males a hostess was able to attract."
4670,然而，尽管男性仍居统治地位，不管法国还是外国的观察者们都仍在抱怨女人在法国的政治事务中所拥有的过分的影响力。,"Despite this male domination, however, both French and foreign observers complained that females exerted undue influence in French political affairs."
4670,虽然这种抱怨是有所夸张的，但它还是在18世纪末的法国大革命中导致了沙龙的衰落。,"Though exaggerated, this perception led to the decline of salons during the French Revolution toward the end of the century."
4671,这种情况还可能出现在服务部门和制造业：例如，美国跨国公司运用数据控制在中美洲和加勒比地区的生产，欧洲公司甚至在远及南亚的地方也这样做。,"It may also be reflected in the services sector as well as manufacturing: for example, US firms use data inputting offices in Central America and the Caribbean, and European firms do likewise as far afield as South Asia."
4671,它还包括一些情形，跨国公司从事商品和服务的地方性生产，但保持对产品和质量的集中控制。就许多国际名牌商标和服务来说，商标（如贝纳通）被看成是世界范围内同一品质的保证。,It also covers cases where MNCs produce a good or service locally but retain central control over production and quality; for many internationally recognized goods or services the trademark (such as Benetton) is intended as a guarantee of consistent quality the world over.
4672,新的混合社会已经出现，在那里，权力和社会地位己不再倍被那些受过经典教育的人所垄断。,There a new hybrid society had already emerged in which power and social position no longer rested securely in the hands of those with a classical education.
4672,在1842年的鸦片战争结束后，买办阶级迅速遍布中国各通商口岸。,"After the conclusion of the Opium War in 1842, the compradores spread through all the treaty ports of China."
4672,这些人各显神通，在腐败的中国官场和外国商人间充当中间媒介。,These men served in a variety of capacities as intermediaries between decaying Chinese officialdom and the foreign merchants.
4672,他们的地位暧昧不清。,Their position was ambiguous.
4672,他们用可疑的手段聚敛起大量财富，过着优雅舒适的生活。,By shady methods they could accumulate great fortunes to live a life of cultivated ease.
4672,另一方面，许多中国人把他们斥之为洋鬼子的走狗。正是这些洋鬼子，毁坏了中国社会的基础。,"On the other hand, many Chinese condemned them as servants of the foreign devils who were destroying the foundations of Chinese society."
4672,从这种观点出发，中国社会史和外交史的大部分著作，都记录着中国试图对这种混合社会加以控制的种种措施，与此同时，强大的外来势力则试图利用这一点，在中国打开缺口，为他们的商业利益和政治利益服务。,"From this point on-ward, much of China’s social and diplomatic history becomes a record of Chinese attempts to keep this hybrid society in check and of contrary efforts by stronger powers to use it as an entering wedge for their commercial and political interests."
4673,尽管商业资本主义处于增长中，但是欧洲经济的主体依然依赖自13世纪以来很少变化的农业经济体系。,"Despite the growth of commercial capitalism, most of the European economy still depended on an agricultural system that had experienced few changes since the thirteenth century."
4673,至少80%的欧洲人仍然从事农业劳动。,At least 80 percent of Europeans still worked on the land.
4673,尽管许多人仍须向贵族交付一定的封建租税，几乎所有西欧的农民不再受奴役。,"Almost all of the peasants of western Europe were free of serfdom, although many still owed a variety of feudal dues to the nobility."
4674,社会主义和马克思主义在国际上的传播已经引起了极大的关注——这并不令人吃惊，因为这些思想是在国内被先锋队有意识地使用的，而且在国际上作为苏联的一种外交政策工具。,"The international travels of socialism and Marxism have received a great deal of attention --- not surprisingly, given the conscious use of these ideas by vanguard parties domestically and as an instrument of Soviet foreign policy internationally."
4674,也许很少有人注意到，在过去两个世纪里，科学和自由话语同时从西方传播到世界的其他地方。,Less attention has perhaps been paid to the parallel diffusion of scientific and liberal discourses from the West to the rest of the world over the last two centuries.
4674,相对不被注意可能在一定程度上根源于以下事实，即这些话语已经随同一整套的制度组织被传播了。而社会主义本身在很大程度上是作为一种意识形态因素被传播的。,"In part, this relative lack of attention may stem from the fact that these discourses have been diffused in conjunction with a whole set of institutional organizations and practices, while socialism to a great extent has been diffused as an ideological force in its own right."
4675,社会革命党则致力于推翻沙皇独裁政权，建立农民社会主义。,The Social Revolutionaries worked to overthrow the tsarist autocracy and establish peasant socialism.
4675,由于没有任何反对政权的其他途径，这些人于是诉诸政治恐怖主义，试图谋杀政府官员以及皇室成员。,"Having no other outlet for opposition to the regime, they advocated political terrorism, attempting to assassinate government officials and members of the ruling dynasty."
4675,对沙皇政权的日益加重的敌视最终爆发为1905 年的革命。,The growing opposition to the tsarist regime finally exploded into revolution in 1905.
4676,第一，不能再认为国家政府是有效的政治权力的所在之处——有效的权力被不同的力量和机构在国家、地区和国际各个层次上分享并交换。第二，命运政治共同体——一个自决的集休——的观念不能再仅局限于单个的民族-国家的边界之内。,"First, the locus of effective political power can no longer be assumed to be national governments---effective power is shared and bartered by diverse forces and agencies at national, regional and international levels. Second, the idea of a political community of fate---of a self-determining collectivity---can no longer meaningfully be located within the boundaries of a single nation-state alone."
4676,一些最基本的决定政治共同体内部以及不同的政治共同体之间生活机会特征的力量和过程现在居于单个的民族-国家的范围之外。,Some of the most fundamental forces and processes which determine the nature of life chances within and across political communities are now beyond the reach of individual nation-states.
4677,大气和气候系统是生命生存最基本的资源，这些资源被每一个国家和社会所拥有但又超越每一个国家与社会。,"The atmosphere and the climatic system are resources, essential for life, that immerse and exceed every state and society."
4677,我们很难想像任何一个人可以有效地占有大气，而且有人可以不使用大气。然而，任何具体而小范围的行动带来的结果都可能影响到极难预测而且易变的整个自然界。,"It is inconceivable that anyone can effectively own the atmosphere and no one can be excluded from its usage, yet the consequences of any actions in specific and small locales can have impacts of a highly unpredictable and volatile nature all over the planet."
4677,这些共享的生态系统固有的全球性特征意味着，空间上分离的社会行动和社会网络有可能以强有力的方式紧密地联系在一起。,The intrinsically global character of these common ecosystems means that spatially separated social actions and networks can become bound together in powerful ways.
4678,路德仅仅保留了天主教会七项圣礼中的两项：浸洗礼和圣餐礼。,Luther kept only two of the Catholic church’s seven sacraments: baptism and the Lord’s Supper.
4678,浸洗礼意味着依靠上帝的恩典获得重生。,Baptism signified rebirth through grace.
4678,路德根据圣餐礼否定了天主教的圣餐变体论，根据这种观点，圣餐礼上消费掉的面包和葡萄酒会奇迹般地转换成耶稣的血肉。,"Regarding the Lord’s Supper or the Eucharist, Luther denied the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation, which taught that the substance of the bread and wine consumed in the rite is miraculously transformed into the body and blood of Jesus."
4679,他把他的宗教观称为“基督教哲学”，其含义是，基督教应该成为指导日常生活的哲学纲领，而不是像中世纪教会强调的那种独断的信仰和行为体系。,"He called his conception of religion ""the philosophy of Christ,"" by which he meant that Christianity should be a guiding philosophy for the direction of daily life rather than the system of dogmatic beliefs and practices that the medieval church seemed to stress."
4679,换句话说，他重视内心的虔诚而淡化宗教的外部形式（例如圣餐礼、朝拜、斋戒、圣徒崇拜和圣物等)。,"In other words, he emphasized inner piety and deemphasized the external forms of religion (such as the sacraments, pilgrimages, fasts, veneration of saints, and relics)."
4679,为了回归到早期简朴教会，人们需要理解《圣经》的原始含义和早期教会的神父的主张。,"To return to the simplicity of the early church, people needed to understand the original meaning of the Scriptures and early church fathers."
4680,不仅欧洲内部的贸易在发展，而且欧洲和外部世界之间的贸易也在发展。,Commerce was growing not only within Europe but also between Europe and the outside world.
4680,这时的国际贸易的发展也是随着维金人终止劫掠活动而开始；维金人多次侵袭欧洲的恐怖曾在9和10世纪笼罩从北极区到西西里岛的欧洲沿海地带。,"Here, again, growth began when the Viking raids stopped, ending the terror that had dominated European coasts from the Arctic to Sicily in the ninth and tenth centuries."
4680,国际贸易发展的另一动力来自从11世纪起的十字军东征。,Another impetus from the eleventh century onward was provided by the Crusades.
4680,成千上万的欧洲人参加了这一次次的远征；他们回国后仍垂涎于自己在东方所见到和享受到的种种奇妙的奢侈品。,The tens of thousands of Europeans who had participated in the expeditions returned with an appetite for the strange and luxurious commodities they had seen and enjoyed abroad.
4681,工业化的社会和政治代价巨大，工业劳动力从1932到1940年之间增长了数百万，而在住房方面的总投资在1929年之后实际上是下降的，结果就是数百万工人及其家庭居住条件恶劣。,"The social and political costs of industrialization were enormous.While the industrial labor force increased by millions between 1932 and 1940, total investment in housing actually declined after 1929, with the result that millions of workers and their families lived in pitiful conditions."
4681,"1928到1940年间，工业工人的实际工资下降了43%, 又制定了严格的法令禁止工人自由迁徙。","Real wages in industry also declined by 43 percent between 1928 and 1940, and strict laws limited workers’ freedom of movement."
4681,为了激励工人，平息他们的不满，政府的宣传机器强调，为建设一个社会主义新国家应做出必要的牺牲。,"To inspire and pacify the workers, government propaganda stressed the need for sacrifice to build the new socialist state."
4682,今天，跨国公司在大范围内组织着全球化生产。,"Today, the globalization of production is organized in large measure by MNCs."
4682,它们在世界产出、贸易、投资和技术转化中的卓越表现是史无前例的。,"Their pre-eminence in world output, trade, investment and technology transfer is unprecedented."
4682,即使跨国公司存在明确的国家基础，它们的利益所在就是全球性利润。,"Even when MNCs have a clear national base, their interest is in global profitability above all."
4682,跨国公司从国内公司发展到使用国际投资的国际公司，目的是为了利用其竞争优势。,MNCs have grown from national firms to global concerns using international investment to exploit their competitive advantages.
4683,"伦敦、纽约和东京市场联系如此紧密,以至于它们作为全天候单一市场发挥功能。它们占这些资产交易的大部分，并开始为世界价格设定了一个基点。","The London, New York and Tokyo markets have become so enmeshed that they function as a twenty-four-hour single market; they account for the majority of trade in these assets and act to set benchmark world prices."
4683,当这些资产的主要国内市场已变得高度融入，且这些资产越来越多地在世界所有主要的金融中心交易时，世界范围内的股票、公司债券和其他金融资产的市场也开始发展。,"But worldwide markets for equities, corporate bonds and other financial assets are evolving too as the major national markets for these assets have become significantly enmeshed and such assets are traded increasingly within all the principal world financial centres."
4684,冷战构建了一个独特的全球权力关系体系。它一方面将全球分裂为对抗的集团，而另一方面又在一个战略上相互联系的世界军事秩序中将其统一起来。,"The Cold War constituted a unique system of global power relations which, paradoxically, both divided the globe into rival camps and yet unified it within a strategically interconnected world military order."
4684,它包括广阔的、高度密集的区域性和全球性的军事权力网以及庞大的军事基地，至少对于超级大国来讲，这可使它对世界上的几乎任何一个地点发动史无前例的毁灭性打击。,"It involved extensive and intensive regional and global networks of military power and, for the superpowers at least, enormous military infrastructures to project unparalleled destructive power to almost any single site on the world's surface."
4685,贸易“强度”是全球贸易活动重要性的一个标尺。,The intensity of trade is a measure of the magnitude of global trading activity.
4685,我们可以借助世界贸易与世界产出的比率来估计，即使这种全球估计是粗线条的。,"It can be estimated by the ratio of world trade to world output, although global estimates of this are very crude."
4685,国家贸易依存度（贸易额占国内生产总值的比例）标准会更精确些，而且，在这项研究中通过对6个国家的长期估计，我们可以提供贸易规模变化的详细的历史过程。,"National trade to GDP measures are more accurate, and long-run estimates for the six countries in this study offer a detailed historical picture of the changing magnitude of trade."
4686,但是，要在民族国家范围内建立一种持久的多元文化主义和在如欧盟这样的政体内建立一种持久的世界主义，这已经被证明是很闲难的。,But it has proved difficult to create an enduring multiculturalism within nation-states and an enduring cosmopolitanism within regimes like the EU.
4686,"在过去的40年中，西欧的政治精英和欧盟组织本身已经投入了相当大的政治资本和精力来建构欧洲的认同（A.Smith，1992； Leonard, 1998)。","Over the last forty years, Western Europe’s political elites as well as the institutions of the EU itself have put considerable political capital and effort into the construction of a European identity (A. Smith, 1992; Leonard, 1998)."
4686,另一方面，就在1997年，在那些作为研究样本的欧盟国家中，41%的国家认为它们受益于欧盟成员国的身份，而36%的国家认为它们没有从中受益（某董事长，1997),"On the one hand, as recently as 1997, 41 per cent of those sampled in EU states thought their country had benefited from EU membership, while 36 per cent thought their country had not benefited (Directorate General X，1997)."
4687,如果将我们的全球化概念模式应用到世界宗教上，那么，我们可以认为，世界宗教已经具有极大的广度。,
4687,,"Applying our conceptual model of globalization to the world religions, we can argue that they have assumed an extraordinary extensity."
4687,尽管世界宗教的创立可以向前提早几千年，但是我们可以将它们最初的影响浓缩到从公元前300年到公元700年之间约1000年内。,"Although the foundation of world religions stretches back over a number of millennia, we can compress their initial impact to around a thousand-year period between 300 BCE and 700 CE."
4687,佛教和印度教在耶稣诞生前3个世纪就出现了类似当代形式的形式，而伊斯兰教到公元700年时已经到达了它的核心地区。,"Buddhism and Hinduism assumed something like their contemporary form in the three centuries before Jesus's birth, while Islam had reached its core regions by about 700 CE."
4688,的确，强有力的世俗意识形态和话语——自由主义、马克思主义和现代科学——发源于欧洲民族国家体系的内部，其具有的启蒙理性主义无论正确与否，都表明了其普遍诉求和适用性。,"Indeed, from within the heart of the European nation-state system, there emerged powerful secular ideologies and discourses --- liberalism, Marxism and modern science --- whose Enlightenment rationalism, rightly or wrongly, suggested their universal appeal and applicability."
4688,然而，总的来说，正是民族主义变成了越来越强有力的文化力量，至少部分原因在于，民族主义从整体上受到现代国家的支持和资助并被利用。,"Yet, on balance, it was nationalism that became the more powerful cultural force, at least in part because it was systematically backed, funded and deployed by modern states."
4688,从这个角度来说，尽管最强有力的和最重要的文化流动与文化关系已经在现代民族国家范围内形成了，但是，文化全球化的历史高峰仍然在过去。,"On this reading, the high point of cultural globalization lies in the past, while the most powerful and significant cultural flows and cultural relationships have developed within the boundaries of modern nation-states."
4689,概括地描述一下，这无非是英国从劫掠向官僚政治演化的过程。,"Such then, if in sketchy outline, was the evolution of the British from piracy to bureaucracy."
4689,以下的三个相互联系的阶段影响着印度杜会：起初，是英国人想通过建立法律的秩序和固定税，以及确立农村中的财产权的办法，来实现农业的商品化，结果这个做法失败了；第二步是农村手工业遭到局部破坏；最后一步是1857年试图挣脱英国人奴役的兵变的失败。,"Three interrelated consequences for Indian society followed: the beginnings of an abortive commercialization of agriculture through the establishment of law and order, regular taxes, and property in the countryside; secondly, the partial destruction of rural handicrafts, and, finally, an unsuccessful attempt to throw off the British yoke in the Mutiny of 1857.In turn these three processes set the basic framework for what has taken place down to the present day."
4689,反过来，这三个阶段又为从那时沿至今天的印度社会的多种变化提供了基本构架。,
4690,《九十五条论纲》标志着宗教改革的开端。,
4690,,"To most historians, the publication of Luther’s Ninety-Five Theses marks the beginning of the Reformation."
4690,对路德而言，它们仅仅是对约翰·德采尔滥售赎罪券的行为的一种回应。,"To Luther, they were simply a response to what he considered the blatant abuse of Johann Tetzel’s selling of indulgences."
4690,尽管论纲是用拉丁文撰写的，但是很快就被译成德文，在整个德意志广泛传播。,"Although written in Latin, the theses were soon translated into German and disseminated widely across Germany."
4691,全球工业通过贸易重组导致的发达国家内部深刻的结构变革，以及发达国家之间专业化和变革，并没有带来国家竞争力的普遍丧失。,"The global reorganization of industry through trade has led to profound structural changes within, and between, developed economies through specialization, rather than a general loss of national competitiveness."
4691,即使技术已扩散到发展中国家，发达国家的竞争优势也未被削弱，因为竞争的基础已经转移到相对丰富的熟练劳动力上来了。,Even where technology has been diffused to developing countries the competitive advantage of developed economies has not been eliminated since the basis of competition has shifted towards the relative abundance (as noted) of skilled labour.
4691,实际上，发达国家一直保持着其大部分的竞争力和技术优势。,In practice the developed countries have maintained much of their competitive and technological advantage.
4692,也就是说，这个时期向美国的迁移在一定程度上是向西方社会迁移的主要组成部分。,"That said, the US migrations of that period were by some way the major migrations to Western societies."
4692,战后，随之进行的是向欧洲国家的大迁移（对于类似的比较以及类似的结论，请参看Morawska和Spohn，1997)，例如，德国在1950〜1988年间的总迁移量是2450万，迁往法国的总人数是2190万。,"In the postwar era, they have been accompanied by very large migrations to European nations (for a similar comparison, with similar conclusions, see Morawska and Spohn, 1997).In the case of Germany, total gross migration for the period 1950-88 totalled 24.5 million, while those to France totalled 21.9 million."
4692,在同一时期，英国、低地国家（包括荷兰、比利时和卢森堡）瑞士和斯堪的纳维亚国家的迁移量总共约2500万（这个估计数字来自S0PEMI，1991年及更早的年份；以及Mitchell，1975，1992）。,"The UK, the Low Countries, Switzerland and Scandinavia add around another 25 million migrants over the same period.(Estimates calculated from SOPEMI, 1991 and earlier years; and Mitchell, 1975; 1992.)"
4693,这些全球关系的制度化和正规化依然非常有限。,"Once again, the degree to which these global relationships were institutionalized and regulated remained very limited."
4693,在欧洲，国家间的外交和互惠性承认体制正在伴随着国家行为的多边调节体制的出现发展着。,Within Europe an interstate system of diplomacy and reciprocal recognition was emerging alongside aspects of the multilateral regulation of interstate behaviour through developments such as the Concert of Europe.
4693,“四国联盟”就是这种调节体制的一个代表。,
4693,"这个欧洲各国组成的社会也在不断地、通过各种方法努力把“文明标准”扩展到欧洲之外以及它的帝国前哨（Watson, 1992, 1997)。","This European society of states also sought, incrementally and by various methods, to extend the 'standards of civilization' beyond Europe and its imperial outposts (Watson, 1992,1997)."
4694,当然，显著的差异仍然存在。,"Of course, significant differences remain."
4694,美国的霸权主义军事角色仍在继续，并且由于1989年苏联的解体而进一步加强。,"The USA's hegemonic military role continues, reinforced by the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989."
4694,尽管英国和法国仍然是联合国安理会的常任理事国，享有否决权，但其作为全球行动者的地位自1945年以后已趋于衰落。,"While Britain and France remain key permanent members of the Security Council of the United Nations, enjoying veto powers, their position as global actors has been subject to decline since 1945."
4694,这两个国家都曾经历过主要的地缘政治角色，现在都在国际和联合国事务中扮演次要角色，尽管是重要的次角。,"Both countries once enjoyed primary geopolitical roles and now have secondary roles, albeit significant secondary roles, in interstate and UN affairs."
4695,在关健的时刻，西方选择了支持满清政府的立场以反对它国内的敌人，如太平军的叛乱。这便使统治者更加不易觉察自己所面临的危险。,"At crucial points the West chose to support the Manchu dynasty against internal enemies, as in the Taiping Rebellion, a factor that further slowed any awakening of the rulers to the dangers that threatened them."
4695,当国内危机四伏，比如义和团叛乱兴起之时，帝国的衰败程度已到了不可救药的地步。,"When important circles had become fully alive to the dangers, let us say by the time of the Boxer Rebellion, the process of dynastic decay had gone too far to be arrested."
4696,到了70年代，特许生产成为主要的制度化机制。通过此机制，军事技术不仅在各个联盟中被转移，而且也在主要的供应国和第三世界国家之间进行转移。,"By the 1970s, licensed production became a key institutional mechanism through which military technology was transferred not just within each alliance, but also between the major suppliers and Third World states."
4696,最大的军事技术许可国是美国(参看图2.5)，而最大的被许可国是意大利和日本，但是最大的被许可的集团则是新兴的正在进行工业化的国家。,"By far the largest single licenser of military technology is the US (see figure 2.5), while the largest licensees are Italy and Japan.But the largest single group of licensees are the newly industrializing nations."
4697,欧洲经过二十年惊人的经济增长后，20世纪70年代中期经历了严重的经济衰退通货膨胀和失业急剧上升。,"After two decades of incredible economic growth, Europe experienced severe economic recessions in the mid-1970s and early 1980s.Both inflation and unemployment rose dramatically."
4697,1973年石油价格的大幅度上涨是经济第一次低迷的主要致因。,A substantial increase in the price of oil in 1973 was a major cause of the first downturn.
4697,另外，世界范围内的经济衰退也导致对欧洲商品需求量的下降。,"Moreover, a worldwide recession had led to a decline in demand for European goods."
4697,西欧各国经济在20世纪80年代开始复苏，尽管仍有很多问题。,"The economies of the Western European states recovered in the course of the 1980s, although problems remained."
4698,就经济关系和社会关系而论，文明之前的部落成员对维持生活所必需的自然资源的权利是平等的、不受约束的。,"So far as economic and social relationships were concerned, the tribal peoples before the advent of civilization had enjoyed free and equal access to the natural resources necessary for livelihood."
4698,经济平等和社会地位相同是新石器时代村社的标志。,Economic equality and social homogeneity had been the hallmark of their Neolithic villages.
4698,但是，当部落成员成为农民时，他们对土地的权利不再是不受约束的，也不再享有自己的全部劳动成果。,But when the tribal peoples became peasants they no longer had free access to land and they no longer enjoyed the full product of their labor.
4699,因为认识不统一，这就产生了大额交易的条件并为投机提供了可能。,"Since there is a range of opinions among traders, this creates the conditions for high volumes of trading and possibilities for speculation."
4699,特別是图表论（chanism）会使汇率偏离其均衡价值，多数交易者的短期行为会导致这种波动的相对集中。,"In particular, chartism can drive the exchange rate away from its equilibrium value, the short-term focus of most traders leading to a relative concentration on such movements."
4699,从长期來看，存在着利率平价的趋势，这包括主要国家内实际利率的趋同，也意味着资金成本的趋同。,"Over the longer term there is evidence of interest rate parity, including evidence of convergence of real interest rates among the leading economies, implying some convergence in the costs of capital."
4700,另外，随着《单一欧洲法》的通过，对许多问题领域，部长委员会内部的一致通过已被“规定数量的多数票批准”（qualified majority voting）所取代（参见Nael，1989）。,"Moreover, with the passing of the Single European Act, unanimity within the Council of Ministers has been replaced by 'qualified majority voting' for a significant number of issue areas (see Noel, 1989)."
4700,尽管在这一变化中还有某些对于国家主权的维护（哪些问题可由多数票决定本身必须基于一致同意），但某些个别政府反对的政策已可以获得通过了。,"While there are certain safeguards to national sovereignty built into this change (decisions about which issues can be decided by majority voting must themselves be based on unanimity), policies can be adopted which are opposed by individual governments."
4700,这样，国家主权的地位就不再有保证了。,"The place of national sovereignty is, thus, no longer guaranteed."
4701,地方的政治压力促成了交通运输的很大改进，这就使得图尔兹地区所生产的谷物能够大量的（按18世纪的标准）运往遥远的地区出售。,"Local political pressures had produced great improvement in transportation, making it possible to sell grain at a considerable distance from Toulouse and in quantities that were substantial by eighteenth-century standards."
4701,就这些方面来说法国的情况基本上和英国相类似。,On all these counts the situation was basically similar to that in England.
4701,图尔兹的军事贵族和我们已经注意到的穿袍贵族一样，成功地适应了新的形势，而这种形势又是他们参与创造出来的——正如英国热情的乡绅所做的那样。,"The nobles of Toulouse, those of the sword as well as those of the robe as we have already noticed, made just as successful an adaptation to circumstances they had helped to create as did the hearty squires of England."
4702,在英国人出现在舞台上之前，放债人通常需要的是农民的谷物，而不是土地，因为土地十分充裕，并且因无人耕种而价值很小。,"Before the British appeared on the scene, the moneylender generally sought the peasant’s crop, not the land, which was abundant and of little value without someone to cultivate it."
4702,这种情况一直持续到19世纪后半期，直到地价开始上涨以及英国人通过法庭普遍实行财产保护时为止。至此，又由于兵变和人口的不断增加，以及农村中人口负荷的加强，使得地价上涨的趋势不断发展。,"This situation continued until well into the second half of the nineteenth century, that is, until land values began to rise and British protection of property through the courts began to take hold widely, a tendency strengthened by the Mutiny and subsequent increased reliance on men of substance and standing in the countryside."
4702,放债人这时开始改变策略，把取得土地所有权作为目标，他让农民仍然留在原有土地上为他耕作，以此取得固定收入。,"At this point the moneylender began to change his tactics and sought to gain possession of the land itself, still leaving the peasant on it to cultivate it for him and produce a steady income."
4703,俄国和日本的历史学家强调指出，在这些国家里共同承担税收对于巩同村庄团结极其重要，因此，我们也应注意中国的官僚体制是否加强了村庄的共同责任心。,"Since historians of Russia and Japan have stressed the importance of collective responsibility for taxes in producing the solidary villages characteristic of these countries, it is worthwhile drawing attention to the fact that the Imperial system in China also imposed collective responsibility."
4703,中国晚期的资料表明，税收在中国并没有产生相似的结果。,"So far as evidence from a later time indicates, the Chinese system did not produce similar results."
4703,"虽然大量的税收实践无疑是一个重要的因素,但靠这显然无法使村庄团结起来。","Evidently taxation practices are insufficient by themselves to create cohesive village communities, though they are undoubtedly an important factor."
4703,"正如我们已经看到的，国家为了自己的目的试图用""保甲制度”来建立和巩固这种团结。","For its own purposes, as we have seen, the Empire tried to create solidarity through the pao-chia."
4704,第一次世界大战和第二次世界大战的一个主要差别在于欧洲殖民地的结局。,A major difference between the first and second world wars lay in their colonial aftermaths.
4704,欧洲对殖民地帝国的控制因第一次世界大战而被削弱，但还没有遭到彻底的破坏；实际上，欧洲因获得作为托管地的阿拉伯地区而扩大了它的殖民地范围。,"Europe’s hold over the colonial empires was weakened but not broken by World War I; indeed, the colonial holdings were expanded by the acquisition of Arab lands as mandates."
4704,相反，第二次世界大战之后，不可阻挡的革命浪潮席卷诸殖民地帝国，极其迅速地结束了欧洲的统治。,"After World War II, by contrast, an irrepressible revolutionary wave swept the colonial empires and ended European domination with dramatic speed."
4705,这部分是因为国家仍只是一个空壳，那时没有常备军，而且战争的行为主要是一种私人的事务。,"In part this was because states were still rather hollow shells, there were no standing armies and the conduct of war was a largely private affair."
4705,正式的外交体系的发展以及国家垄断的巩固为更加全面和系统管制战争行为的尝试提供了制度基础。,The development of formal systems of diplomacy and the consolidation of the states' monopoly over the means of violence provided the institutional infrastructure for more comprehensive and systematic attempts to regulate the conduct of war.
4705,法国大革命和随后的拿破仑战争进一步推动了这一过程。,"The French Revolution and the subsequent Napoleonic Wars, which culminated in the Peace of Vienna, encouraged this process further."
4706,官方估计，1900-1942年间的总体迁移人数约62万（外务部，1971)。,"Official estimates put the total level of migration over the period 1900-42 at around 620,000 (Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 1971)."
4706,移入日本的人数比这个数字小得多。,Immigration to Japan was much smaller than this.
4706,官方数字显示，在1910年只有1.5万外国人居住在日本，这个数字到1930年时只上升到5.4万，它占人口总数的比例还不到0.1%。,"Official figures show that in 1910 there were only 15,000 foreigners resident in Japan, a figure that only grew to 54,000 by 1930."
4707,如果人们评估移民所带来的经济影响，那么，移民不能被认为是同质的群体。,Migrants cannot be considered as a homogeneous mass when their economic impact is assessed.
4707,相反，不同的移民群体对东道国经济带来的影响将是非常不同的。,"Conversely, there will be widely differing consequences for different groups in the host economy."
4707,在东道国劳动力市场中移民之间存在相当大的差异。,There is considerable polarization among immigrants in host labour markets.
4707,在许多经合组织成员国中，很大一部分外来工人都是掌握熟练技术的专业人员，通常他们来自其他的西方国家。,"In many OECD countries a significant percentage of foreign workers are highly skilled professionals, often from other Western countries."
4708,冷战构建了一个独持的全球权力关系体系。它一方面将全球分裂为对抗的集团，而另一方面又在一个战略上相互联系的世界军事秩序中将其统一起来。,"The Cold War constituted a unique system of global power relations which, paradoxically, both divided the globe into rival camps and yet unified it within a strategically interconnected world military order."
4708,它包括广阔的、高度密集的区域性和全球性的军事权力网以及庞大的军事基地，至少对于超级大国来讲，这可使它对世界上的几乎任何一个地点发动史无前例的毁灭性打击。,"It involved extensive and intensive regional and global networks of military power and, for the superpowers at least, enormous military infrastructures to project unparalleled destructive power to almost any single site on the world's surface."
4708,这种权力关系体系也被高度的制度化和分层化（分为第一世界、第二世界和第三世界）（参看地图2-3)。,"It was also highly institutionalized and stratified (into the First World, Second World and Third World) (see map 2.3)."
4709,反革命攻击的主要目标是资本主义。它们反对城镇附近的、以及散居在旺代省中心区的商人和制造工业主。,"The main thrust of the counterrevolution was anticapitalist, against the merchants and manufacturers in nearby towns and those scattered through the heart of the Vendee itself."
4709,在顽强地抵制资本主义渗透的过程中，旺代省的反革命势力和俄国、中国20世纪共产主义胜利前的农民（这是摧毁俄国、中国旧统治的主要力量）极为相似。,"In its violent rejection of intruding capitalism, the counterrevolution of the Vendee resembles the great peasant upheavals that were the main popular force breaking apart the old regimes of Russia and China before the communist victories of the twentieth century."
4710,17世纪，科学知识与对科学的探索急剧地增加。,"During the seventeenth century, scientific learning and investigation began to increase dramatically."
4710,欧洲的各主要大学都设立了新的科学教席，尤其是医学方面。,"Major universities in Europe established new chairs of science, especially in medicine."
4710,由国王或贵族资助的科学家的存在已成为一种国际现象。,Royal and princely patronage of individual scientists became an international phenomenon.
4711,发达资本主义国家在保存原初民族文化（可能具有神话虚构性质）的过程中或者在控制国家范围内部和国家之间信息流动的过程中，从它们遇到的所有困难和约束來看，现在仍然没有什么迹象表明，这些民族主义者的文化事业处在末期的衰落过程中。,"For all the difficulties and constraints that SIACS now encounter in preserving a pristine, if mythic, national culture, or in controlling the flow of information and opinion within and across their borders, there is little sign as yet that these nationalist cultural projects are in terminal decline."
4711,最后，好莱坞、微软和AT&T仍然在经营上有利可图——没有建立可替代的政治认同和合法性中心。,"In the end, Hollywood, Microsoft and AT&T are in the business of making money --- not founding alternative centres of political identity and legitimacy."
4711,然而，巨大信息流、人口流和图像流在全球范围内传播，并安然无恙地跨越国界，这已经改变了各种民族事业发展所必需的环境。,"Yet the huge flows of information, people and imagery that circulate around the globe, crossing borders with impunity, have changed the context in which national projects of any kind must develop."
4712,在意大利 (伦巴达人的运动）、西班牙（巴斯克人和加泰罗尼亚人的运动）、加拿大（魁北克集团的运动）和比利时（瓦龙和佛兰德地区之间的运动）也可以发现类似的强大运动。,"Similarly powerful movements can be found in Italy (Legga Lombarda), in Spain (the Basque and Catalonian movements), in Canada (Bloc Quebecois) and in Belgium (between the Walloon and Flemish regions)."
4712,美国有许多右翼反国家主义集团。,In the US there are many right-wing antistatist groups.
4712,在每一种情况下，由于区域或地方要求有独立的文化认同或者需要独立的政治主权，民族国家的领土完整和文化统一因此受到挑战。,In every case the territorial integrity and cultural unity of the nation-state is open to challenge on the basis of regional or local assertions of distinctive cultural identity and the need for a divided or separate political sovereignty.
4713,早期文明发展起来的原因一直是难以解释清楚。,Why early civilizations developed remains difficult to explain.
4713,一种理论坚持认为，外界的挑战迫使人类努力地应对，由此就产生了文明。,One theory maintains that challenges forced human beings to make efforts that resulted in the rise of civilization.
4713,有些学者强调物质力量的作用，如食物剩余的增加，使劳动分工和行政组织群体的产生成为可能。,"Some scholars have argued that material forces, such as the growth of food surpluses, made possible the specialization of labor and development of large communities with bureaucratic organization."
4714,复兴一词意味着“再生”。,"Renaissance means ""rebirth."""
4714,许多生活在1350—1550年间的意大利人深信他们见证了古代遗物或者希腊—罗马文明的再生，这标志着一个新时代的到来。,"Many people who lived in Italy between 1350 and 1550 believed that they were witnessing a rebirth of antiquity or Greco-Roman civilization, marking a new age."
4714,在他们看来，从西罗马帝国灭亡到他们生活的时代，这段大约一千多年的时间是一个中间期（由此产生了中世纪)，因为缺少古典文化，这段时期的特征是黑暗。,"To them, the thousand or so years between the end of the Roman Empire and their own era was a middle period (the ""Middle Ages""), characterized by darkness because of its lack of classical culture."
4714,19世纪的历史学家后来采用类似的词汇来描述意大利的这段时期。,Historians of the nineteenth century later used similar terminology to describe this period in Italy.
4714,瑞士历史学家和文艺批评家雅各布•布克哈特在他的《意大利文艺复兴时期的文化》(1860)一书中首创了文艺复兴的概念。,"The Swiss historian and art critic Jacob Burckhardt created the modern concept of the Renaissance in his celebrated work Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy, published in 1860."
4715,另一类全球环境问题是由相互联系的人口扩张和资源消耗现象组成的。,A second category of global environmental problems consists of the interlinked phenomena of demographic expansion and resource consumption.
4715,"所有的环境问题都涉及人口问题，因为在所有其他条件相同的情况下，更多的人意味着更多的污染和资源消耗(WCED,1987)。","All environmental problems have a demographic dimension, for all other things being equal, more people means more pollution and resource consumption (WCED, 1987)."
4715,当代人口增长几乎都是发生在发展中国家，由此而带来的环境后果首先将出现在人口迅速增长的社会中。,Almost all contemporary population growth is occurring in the developing world.The environmental consequences of this will initially be felt in the societies experiencing rapid demographic change.
4715,然而，随着全球性和区域性的共同环境出现地方性污染，这些变化带来的结果渐渐影响到其他国家的经济和政治。,"However, as with the local pollution of the global and regional commons, there is a tendency for the consequences of those changes to spill over into the economics and politics of other nations."
4716,随着沼泽湿地的排干、石南丛生的荒地和灌木地的开垦和森林的砍伐，边缘的生态系统和一些物种消失了。,"Marginal ecosystems and some species were lost as swamps were drained, heathland and scrublands cleared and forests cut down."
4716,许多较大的哺乳动物物种被赶出了它们的生存地并被大量捕杀，如狼和熊。它们渐渐在欧洲的许多地方灭绝了、或者被赶到了欧洲大陆最偏远或不适合生存的角落 （Hoskins，1977；Rackham，1986)。,"Many larger mammal species, denied their habitat and extensively hunted --- like wolves and bears --- were gradually extinguished from much of Europe or penned into the most inaccessible and inhospitable corners of the continent (Hoskins, 1977; Rackham, 1986)."
4717,还有许多规模较小的商业企业愿意出口军事生产技术或把民用技术用于军事方面。,There were also a host of other smaller commercial concerns willing to export military production technology or civil technologies with military applications.
4717,20世纪初，俄国在一些重要的欧洲武器生产制造商的直接帮助下实现了军事生产能力的现代化（Krause，1992，第66页）。,"Russia modernized its military production capability at the turn of the century with the direct assistance of the major European arms producers (Krause, 1992, p. 66)."
4717,像日本、中国、意大利、奥匈帝国、奥斯曼帝国、西班牙和拉丁美洲一些新独立的国家也都从国外进口军事技术，并将其作为实现经济现代化的一个战略（McNeill，1982；Krause，1992)。,"Likewise Japan, China, Italy, Austro-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, Spain and newly independent nations in Latin America imported foreign military technology as part of a strategy of economic modernization (McNeill, 1982; Krause, 1992)."
4718,亚历山大的遗产不仅限于政治，还有文化。,But Alexander also left a cultural legacy.
4718,作为他征服的结果，希腊的语言、艺术、建筑和文学也传遍近东。,"As a result of his conquests, Greek language, art, architecture, and literature spread throughout the Near East."
4718,希腊化时代的大都市多是亚历山大或者其继承者所建，它们成为希腊文化流布的通道。,"The urban centers of the Hellenistic Age, many founded by Alexander and his successors, became springboards for the diffusion of Greek culture."
4719,国家军事职务通常由软弱的宫廷贵族担任，只是挂挂名而已。,Government military posts usually were filled by effeminate court aristocrats.
4719,结果，反对虾夷人的战争则由农村贵族指挥。,"As a result, the campaigns against the Ainu were fought by the rural aristocrats."
4719,他们已成为骑兵武士，其军事战斗力逐渐增强，最后完全超过了帝国军队。,They became mounted warriors and gradually increased their military effectiveness until they completely overshadowed the imperial forces.
4720,在正常的长距离旅行成为可能以后，庞大的贸易帝国周期性地诞生。,Great trading empires have arisen periodically ever since regular long-distance travel became possible.
4720,但是，国际贸易，即在国家间交换商品和服务，实际上只是伴随着民族国家的建立才出现的。,"But international trade, the exchange of goods and services between nations, by definition only emerged with the establishment of the nation-state."
4720,贸易活动一直伴随着现代国家的成长和其财富的增加：国家需要收入以应付军事战争，而贸易则提供了明显的资金来源。,"Trade has been entwined with the rise of the modern state and its fortunes: states required revenues, above all to wage military campaigns, and trade offered an obvious source of funds."
4721,这些概念提供了描述和比较全球和区域迁移的主要历史形式的专业术语。,These concepts provide a vocabulary for describing and comparing the major historical forms of global and regional migration.
4721,然时，关于迁移的可供利用的历史数据的性质在不同时期和不同国家是不断变化的。,"However, the quality of historical data available on migration varies from epoch to epoch and from state to state."
4721,在前现代和现代早期，国家权力的局限性从以下可以获得的最低限度的普查资料——国家的民族构成或迁移水平——显示出来。,The limits of state power in the premodern and early modern era are indicated by the minimal census data available on either the ethnic composition of states or levels of migration.
4722,艺术中的现代主义自文艺复兴以来，画家们在很大程度上都是在努力尽可能精确地反映现实。,"Modernism in the Arts  Since the Renaissance, artists had largely tried to represent reality as accurately as possible."
4722,然而，到19世纪末期，他们开始寻找新的表达形式。,"By the late nineteenth century, however, artists were seeking new forms of expression."
4722,现代美术的开端起于印象派，这是一个19世纪70年代兴起于法国的运动，当时有一群画家拒绝画室和博物馆，而是走到野外直接描绘大自然。,"The preamble to modern painting can be found in Impressionism, a movement that originated in France in the 1870s when a group of artists rejected the studios and museums and went out into the countryside to paint nature directly."
4723,通过乔托的作品，中世纪的传统在佛罗伦萨第一次出现巨大突破，乔托被认为是意大利文艺复兴绘画的先驱。,"The city of Florence witnessed the first dramatic break with medieval tradition in the work of Giotto (1266--1337), often considered a forerunner of Italian Renaissance painting."
4723,他的足迹几乎遍及意大利，但他最著名的作品是在帕多瓦和佛罗伦萨完成的。,"Although he worked throughout Italy, Giotto’s most famous works were done in Padua and Florence."
4723,乔托受惠于正规的拜占庭学派，但他以一种崭新的现实主义实现了超越。他渴望摹仿自然，文艺复兴的艺术家后来将这种模仿视为古典艺术的基本内容。,"Coming out of the formal Byzantine school, Giotto transcended it with a new kind of realism, a desire to imitate nature that Renaissance artists later identified as the basic component of Classical art."
4724,"虽然最初英国跨国公司的投资集中于英联邦国家, 但70年代起，其投资开始向经合发国家集中（Hood和 Young，1997)。","Although initially British MNCs' investments were concentrated in the Commonwealth, since the 1970s, in particular, investment has become concentrated in OECD countries (Hood and Young, 1997)."
4724,英国跨国公司在消费品、化工和工程机械生产中拥有特别的优势。所以，它们在这些部门建立了全球性生产网络。,"British MNCs possess particular advantages in consumer goods, chemicals and engineering products and so have established global networks of production in some parts of these sectors."
4725,第二种转换并没有在所有的方面取代第一种转换；多层的治理既出现在政治边界内部，也跨越了政治边界，形成一种新的多层治理体系。,"The second shift by no means replaces the first in all respects; layers of governance emerge both within and across political boundaries creating a new, multilayered system of governance."
4725,但是，第二种转换以政治的国际化和超国家化，与国家相关的政治决策的许多方面的非领土化，地区和全球的组织与制度的发展，正式的与非正式的地区与全球法律和全球治理的多层体系的出现为标志。,"However, the second shift is marked by the internationalization and transnationalization of politics, the deterritorialization of aspects of political decision-making pertinent to states, the development of regional and global organizations and institutions, the emergence of regional and global law and a multilayered system of global governance, formal and informal."
4725,这种复杂的、有争议的、内部关联着的秩序对于民主的政治共同体的特征有着深刻的影响。,"This complex, contested, interconnected order has profound implications for the nature of the democratic political community."
4726,第一次世界大战造成了古典金本位体制崩溃，第一次世界大战后初期的不稳定，特别是20年代初德国的通货膨胀，阻止了其早期的重建。,"The First World War brought the collapse of the classical Gold Standard system, and the instability of the immediate postwar period, notably the German hyperinflation of the early 1920s, prevented its early reconstruction."
4726,只是到了1925年，英国同美国一道，力图恢复金本位制，到1928年，金本位体制建立起来3参加者之广泛，超过以前——1928-1931年间40多个国家签署了金本位的协议。,It was only in 1925 that Britain joined the US in returning to the Gold Standard.By 1928 the system had been reconstructed with much wider participation than previously --- during 1928-31 over forty territories signed up to the Gold Standard.
4726,此后，因为大萧条逐渐削弱了国际金融合作的基础，金本位体制很快又解体了。,"Thereafter, the system rapidly disintegrated as the Great Depression undermined international financial cooperation."
4727,另一位文艺复兴盛期的巨人，米开朗琪罗，是一位多才多艺的画家、雕刻家和建筑师。,"Michelangelo, an accomplished painter, sculptor, and architect, was another giant of the High Renaissance."
4727,他完全是在创作欲望的驱使下，以极大的热情和精力致力于许多非凡的工程。,"Fiercely driven by his desire to create, he worked with great passion and energy on a remarkable number of projects."
4727,他深受新柏拉图主义的影响，这一点在他绘制的西斯廷教堂天花板上的人物形象中表现得尤为明显。,"Michelangelo was influenced by Neoplatonism, especially evident in his figures on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome."
4728,从16世纪开始，随着欧洲帝国扩张至亚洲，借助于帝国贸易公司，人们在两大洲之间建立起了更广泛的贸易网络。,"As European empires expanded into Asia from the sixteenth century, more extensive trading networks were established between the two continents through imperial trading companies."
4728,这一时期，欧洲对亚洲的贸易一直是逆差，而其只能用继西班牙征服“新世界”之后从美洲掠夺来的金、银以弥补亏空。,"Throughout this period Europe consistently ran a payments deficit with Asia, financing it by gold and silver flows from the Americas following the Spanish conquest of the 'New World'."
4728,在17和18世纪，西印度群岛、欧洲和非洲之间的大西洋贸易体系——三角奴隶贸易——发展起来了（见第6章）。,"During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries an Atlantic trading system --- the slave triangle --- evolved between the West Indies, Europe and Africa (see chapter 6)."
4729,生产过程使广泛而密切的贸易关系成为必要（见第5章）。,Production processes now entail intensive and extensive trading relations (see chapter 5).
4729,现在公司内贸易占贸易总量的1/4-1/3(UNCTAD，1995)。,"Intrafirm trade now accounts for between a quarter and a third of total trade (UNCTAD, 1995)."
4729,"切割价值链也扩大了工业化国家和发展中国家的贸易，促进了向新的国际劳动分工的转变（Castells,1996;Hoogvelt,1997,第3章）。","Slicing up the value chain has increased trade too between industrialized and developing countries, reinforcing the shift towards a new international division of labour (Castells, 1996; Hoogvelt, 1997, ch. 3)."
4729,尽管过去发达工业过程都集中在发达经济体中，现在公司却将产品过程的诸阶段设置在低工资国家或者与亚洲或拉丁美洲的地方公司签订转包合同，由此导致了发达国家与发屐中国家高水平的贸易往来。,"Whereas, in the past, advanced industrial processes tended to be concentrated in developed economies, companies now locate segments of the production process in lower wage countries or subcontract to local companies in Asia or Latin America, which leads to higher levels of trade between developed and developing countries."
4730,仅仅在50年前，欧洲还处在自我毁灭的关头。,Just over fifty years ago Europe was at the point of self-destruction.
4730,从那时起，欧洲创造了新的合作机制、新的维护人权的工具以及政治制度，目的不仅是使成员国对广泛的问题负责，而且要抽取它们的部分主权。,"Since that moment Europe has created new mechanisms of collaboration, new instruments of human rights enforcement and political institutions in order not only to hold member states to account across a broad range of issues, but to pool aspects of their sovereignty."
4730,而且，有众多区域性和全球性跨国行动者正在参与全球化条件的争论——不只是公司，还有像环境运动和妇女运动这样的新社会运动。,"Furthermore, there are many regional and global transnational actors contesting the terms of globalization --- not just corporations but new social movements such as the environmental movement and the women's movement."
4730,“跨国公民社会”中出现了“新的”声音，它们来自里约热内卢的环境大会、开罗的控制人口大会以及北京的世界妇女大会。,"These are the ‘new' voices of an emergent 'transnational civil society', heard for instance at the Rio Conference on the Environment, the Cairo Conference on Population Control and the Beijing Women's Conference."
4731,有一时期，人们曾认为文明的摇篮是尼罗河流域，但现在一致同意，最早的文明中心是苏美尔，也就是《旧约全书》中的“希纳国”（Land of Shinar）。,"Although at one time it was believed that the Nile valley gave birth to civilization, it is now agreed that the earliest centers were in Sumer, the Old Testament's ""land of Shinar."""
4731,苏美尔位于过去称为“美索不达米亚”——大致相当于现在的伊拉克共和国——的南部，南临波斯湾，由若干块荒芜的、被风乱吹的小平原组成。,"This area comprised the barren, wind-swept plains at the head of the Persian Gulf, in the southern part of what used to be known as Mesopotamia and is now the state of Iraq."
4731,约公元前3500年时，一些已改进生产技术，正在耕种这片干旱的荒原的农业公社，成功地完成了从新石器时代的部落文化到文明的过渡。,About 3500b.c. certain communities of agriculturists who had developed techniques for cultivating this arid wasteland successfully completed the transition from Neolithic tribalism to civilization.
4732,在当代世界，它们的作用已经被大型媒体产业和个人与群体越來越多的流动所取代。,In the contemporary world their role has been displaced by that of large media industries as well as by the greater flows of individuals and groups.
4732,多国公司位于这些相互联系的过程的中心。,MNCs are at the heart of these interconnected processes.
4732,"尽管大型的通信公司并不是过去50年的独有现象——而且我们可以将国际新闻机构和出版公司的历史追溯到19世纪。国际电影出版公司的历史可以追溯到两次战争之间的年代——但是，它们带来的文化影响及其力量在历史上都是空前的（参看Herman和McChesney,1997)。","Although large communications corporations are not unique to the last five decades --- and we can trace the origins of international news agencies and publishers back into the nineteenth century, and those of international film exporters to the interwar era --- their cultural reach and power is historically unparalleled (see Herman and McChesney, 1997)."
4733,一定程度上，这些发展是各国中央银行通过国际清算银行合作的结果。国际清算银行的成员，范围已超出了10个最初创始国，包括世界上所有关键的新兴经济体。,"These developments, in part, have been the product of cooperation between national central banks through the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), whose membership is expanding beyond the original ten major economies (G10) to include all the key emerging economies in the world."
4733,"然而，国际清算银行只是一个多边论坛。各国政府，特別是美国政府在促进更广泛的国际金融管理体制的发展中起着关键作用（T.Porter, 1993,第3章；Kapstein，1994b）。","BIS, nevertheless, is only a multilateral forum，and governments，particularly the US, have played a key role in encouraging the development of a more comprehensive international regulatory regime for finance (T. Porter, 1993, ch. 3; Kapstein, 1994b)."
4733,"结果，达成了关于跨国证券交易管理的国际协议（T.Porter, 1993，第4章）。","As a result international agreements have been reached with respect to the regulation of cross-border securities trading (T. Porter, 1993, ch. 4)."
4734,奥古斯丁生于北非，依靠身为热心的基督徒的母亲养育成人。,"Born in North Africa, Augustine was reared by his mother, an ardent Christian."
4734,384年，他终于成为米兰的一名修辞学教授。,He eventually became a professor of rhetoric at Milan in 384.
4734,"在经历了一番深刻动人的宗教生活后，他放弃了自己的教职回到北非,从396年起，他在那里担任希波的主教直至430年去世。","After experiencing a profound and moving religious experience, he gave up his teaching position and went back to North Africa, where he became bishop of Hippo from 396 until his death in 430."
4735,7、8世纪的修女在基督教的传播中也发挥了重要作用。,Nuns of the seventh and eighth centuries also played an important role in the spread of Christianity.
4735,伟大的英国传教士本尼法在英国就依靠修女提供图书和金钱。,The great English missionary Boniface relied on nuns in England for books and money.
4735,他还请求女修道院长选派修女到新皈依的日耳曼地区建立修道院。,He also asked the abbess of Wimborne to send groups of nuns to establish convents in newly converted German lands.
4735,一个名为例奥巴的修女在日耳曼的比索夫斯海姆建立了第一个修道院。,A nun named Leoba established the first convent in Germany at Bischofsheim.
4736,随着1972年芝加哥期权贸易市场的建立，衍生品急剧增长。,"The growth of derivatives trading, following the establishment of the Chicago Options Exchange in 1972, has been astronomical."
4736,国际衍生品的交易热潮只是在80年代中期才真正开始，但表4-8显示，未偿总价值已增长7倍，达到大约100亿美元，而场外交易增长更快，是外汇交易市场规模的两倍。,"Trade in international derivatives only really began in earnest in the mid-1980s but, as table 4.8 shows, the total value of contracts outstanding has risen over sevenfold to around $10 trillion, while OTC contracts have risen even faster to over twice the size of the exchange-traded market."
4736,如此考虑，衍生品的名义未偿价值要高于世界国内生产总值。,"To put this in perspective, the notional outstanding value of derivatives is higher than world GDP."
4737,如果有人为业余乐趣作辩护，强调其积极贡献，那么，同样可以提出许多相反的评价意见。,"If there is some justification for regarding the conception of the amateur as a positive contribution, there are clear grounds for a negative assessment of several other ideas."
4737,,"Those about to be discussed, however, arise in quite a different social context."
4737,各执一辞的纷纭议论，前因后果和来龙去脉各不相同。反动的社会理论容易在土地贵族中滋生繁衍，他们总算保住了政治权力，却丢掉了经济权力，或者说，为陌生的新兴经济权力所威胁。,Reactionary social theories are liable to flourish in a landed upper class that manages to hang onto political power successfully although it is losing out economically or perhaps is threatened by a new and strange source of economic power.
4738,例如，在中国，汉族的明朝取代了蒙古族的元朝，整个国家又完全回到老路上来。,"In China, for example, the native Ming dynasty replaced the Mongol Yuan, and the country returned with a vengeance to age-old ways."
4738,在庞大的穆斯林世界里，土生土长的希腊-罗马人、伊朗人、闪米特人以及埃及人的各自传统，非但未被湮灭，反而溶汇成一种综合的伊斯兰教文明。,"In the sprawling Moslem world the indigenous Greco-Roman.Iranian.Semitic, and Egyptian traditions were not wiped out but rather were fused into the civilization of Islam."
4738,同样，东罗马帝国又以拜占廷帝国的名称继续生存了整整1000年。因此，直至近代，其居民仍称自己为“罗马人”。,"Likewise the East Roman Empire continued without interruption for a full millennium as the Byzantine Empire, so that its inhabitants referred to themselves in modern times as ""Romaioi,"" or Romans."
4739,"从这个角度来看,15世纪以来，欧洲帝国扩张带来的迁移更接近于中国或罗马式的定居国家向外扩张带来的移民。",Viewed in this perspective the migrations that initially accompanied the outward push of European empire-building from the fifteenth century onwards are closer to the Chinese or Roman pattern of settled states expanding outwards.
4739,然向，已经建立的帝国和移民社区与原来的扩张中心往往被广阔的海洋隔开，从这个意义上说，这种迁移又更加接近伊斯兰国家模式，伊斯兰国家跨越了中东并到达了印度洋附近。,"However, established imperial outposts and emigrant communities were separated from the metropolis by vast transoceanic distances and in that regard are closer to the network of Islamic states which spread out across the Middle East and around the Indian Ocean."
4739,但是，欧洲人在大洋洲和美洲建立的帝国与罗马、中国或伊斯兰国家不同，它们与当地的文明发生了冲突，欧洲人可以一点一点地从人口上和政治上将它们消灭掉。,"But, unlike Rome, China or Islam, European empires in Oceania and the Americas encountered civilizations that they were able, quite literally, to obliterate, demographically and politically."
4740,伊斯兰教是一种直接的、简单的信仰，它强调遵从安拉意志的必要性。,"Islam was a direct and simple faith, emphasizing the need to obey the will of Allah."
4740,这意味着遵从一项以五功为内容的基本的伦理规范，即信仰安拉、尊穆罕默德为先知；每天例行五次标准的祈祷，每周五中午参加共同的敬拜安拉的祷告；遵守神圣的斋月(伊斯兰历法中的第九个月)的规定，从日出到日落期间禁食；若有可能要参加朝圣，即著名的麦加朝圣，一生至少去麦加朝圣一次，向穷人和不幸的人施舍。,"This meant following a basic ethical code consisting of the Five Pillars of Islam: belief in Allah and Muhammad as his Prophet; standard prayer five times a day and public prayer on Friday at midday to worship Allah; observance of the holy month of Ramadan (the ninth month on the Muslim calendar) with fasting from dawn to sunset; making a pilgrimage (known as the hajj), if possible, to Mecca at least once in one’s lifetime (see the box above); and giving alms to the poor and unfortunate."
4740,严格遵守规定的信徒能够确保获得永生。,The faithful who observed the law were guaranteed a place in an eternal paradise.
4741,第二就是由于危害环境的产品跨国运输而导致的环境退化。这种跨国运输经常是从那些因环境的原因而禁止销售这种产品的国家到这种产品仍然属于合法的那些国家。,"Second, environmental degradation can result from the export of environmentally hazardous products across borders; often from countries where the sale of a product is banned for environmental reasons to countries where it remains legal."
4741,杀虫剂和药品就是这种现象的最好例子（ Paarlberg ，1993)。,"Pesticides and pharmaceuticals are the best examples of this practice (Paarlberg, 1993)."
4742,卡斯特和米勒勾勒了西方国家存在的4种公民身份模式。西方国家的公民身份既是公民身份和民族认同观念的代名词，又是产生于那种文化情境下的各种公共政策的体现：移民政策、归化政策和教育与文化政策。,"Castles and Miller outline four models of citizenship in Western countries which serve as proxies both for attitudes to citizenship and national identity and for clusters of public policies that emerge from that cultural context: immigration policies, naturalization policies and educational and cultural policies."
4742,这4种模式或策略是：虚幻的(illusory )、排他性的（exlusionary）、共和帝国的（republican-imperial)和多文化的（multicultural)。,Those four models/strategies are: illusory; exclusionary; republican-imperial; and multicultural.
4742,对移民的虚幻态度与其说是一种公民身份模式，还不如说是故意忽视移民社群。,Illusory attitudes to immigrants are not so much a citizenship model as the deliberate disregard of immigrant communities.
4743,表4-12显示，虽然国际债券这些基金集中程度很高，但发展中国家现在拥有这些国际债券总量的10%以上。,"As table 4.12 indicates, developing countries now account for over 10 per cent of total international bonds, although such funds are highly concentrated."
4743,债券市场上非洲越来越边缘化，南非则占有这些资金的相当部分。,"Africa is largely marginalized from the bond market, with South Africa accounting for the majority of such flows."
4743,在欧洲，匈牙利和土耳其拥有这些流量的大部分，以色列拥有流向中东的大部分资金。,"In Europe, Hungary and Turkey account for the majority of these flows and Israel accounts for the majority of flows to the Middle East."
4744,英国东印度公司经皇家特许于1600年成立，1858年解散，英国政府代行其功能。,The British East India Company was incorporated by royal charter in 1600 and effectively wound up in 1858 when the British government assumed its functions.
4744,建立东印度公司是为了保护和增强英国对印度贸易的控制，尤其是为了与荷兰相抗衡。随着对印度大部分贸易，如香料、农业原料、鸦片和丝绸的有效垄断，东印度公司发展成为一家联合股票公司。,"Established to defend and increase Britain's control over Indian trade, against the Dutch in particular, it developed into a joint-stock company with an effective monopoly of much Indian trade, notably in spices, agricultural raw materials, opium and textiles."
4745,核电和潜在的核危害情况明显是灾难性环境退化在范围和危险程度上的历史分水岭；而且在过去的30年中，由于越来越多的国家已经建立了越来越多的核电站，因此，这些危险也日益加剧。,The case of nuclear power and potential nuclear hazards is clearly a historical watershed in the scope and dangerous potential for catastrophic environmental degradation; and the last thirty years have seen an intensification of those risks as more and more countries have built more nuclear power stations.
4745,更重要的是，核技术的转变已经产生了复杂的再生和再循环系统，相应地，这也带来了大规模和越来越多的核废料贸易。,"Moreover, the shifts in nuclear technologies have introduced complex systems of reprocessing and recycling which have in turn generated a large-scale and growing trade in nuclear waste."
4745,很明显，这已经给跨国污染和污染威胁增加了新的、重要的维度。,This has clearly added a new and important dimension to transboundary pollution and pollution threats.
4745,在80年代，核废料国际贸易是与其他污染性垃圾的国际贸易的迅速扩张同时进行的（Greenpeace，1993）。,"The international trade in nuclear waste has been paralleled by a rapid expansion in the international trade of other hazardous wastes in the 1980s (Greenpeace, 1993)."
4746,国际货币基金组织（1993)是这样定义外国直接投资的:“直接投资指的是这样的投资：其目的是获得一个经济体中的一家企业，而不是投资者的企业发展的持久利益，投资者的目的是在该企业的管理中拥有有效的发言权。,"The IMF (1993) defines FDI thus: 'Direct investment refers to investment that is made to acquire a lasting interest in an enterprise operating in an economy other than that of the investor, the investor's purpose being to have an effective voice in the management of the enterprise.'"
4746,”在这本书中把证券投资描绘为“长期的债券和公司证券，不包括直接投资和储备”。,
4746,,The same manual describes portfolio investment as 'long-term bonds and corporate equities other than those included in the categories for direct investment and reserves'.
4746,在实践中应用这些定义有些困难。,There are several difficulties in applying these definitions in practice.
4747,广泛利用的技术意味着英国一家小公司出版的书，可以在世界各地的书店中订阅到。,Widely available technology means that a book published by a small company in Britain can be ordered in bookshops around the world.
4747,贸易使所有产出部门的状况发生了革命性变化——今天，几乎没有一种产业仅仅依赖于国内市场或者国内生产部门和原材料。,Trade has revolutionized the prospects of all industrial sectors --- today few industries rely purely on domestic markets or domestically produced components and raw materials.
4747,举例来说，虽然建筑业基本上是使用国内原料，雇用本土的劳动力和满足国内需求，但主要设备可能是进口的。而且，随着建筑公司国际所有权的增加，配套服务也可能进行贸易。,"For example, although the construction industry primarily uses domestic materials, employs local labour and satisfies domestic demand, capital equipment may be imported and, with increasing international ownership of construction firms, support services may also be traded."
4748,全球交往基础设施中的一系列变革一直支撑着所有的全球和区域交往的大幅度增加。,The immense increase in global and regional interactions of all kinds has been supported by a series of transformations in the infrastructure of global interaction.
4748,我们要强调的是，虽然其中某些技术的发明本身不足以解释其利用、普及和增长，但是无可置疑的是，它们推动了当代全球化量的增长和质的改变。,"We emphasize that the invention of some of these technologies is not sufficient by itself to account for their deployment, use and growth; but their contribution to both the increased volume and transformed character of contemporary globalization is undeniable."
4748,从运输技术角度来看，战后的岁月不仅见证了像内燃机和铁路这样的旧技术的广泛使用和全球普及，也见证了新的运输方式的发展。后者包括喷飞机和集装箱运输，它们在长距离运输大宗货物方面更快，或者说更有效率。,"In terms of transport infrastructurethe postwar era has witnessed the intensified use and global spread of older technologies like the internal combustion engine and railways.It has also seen the development of new forms of transport that are considerably quicker, or considerably more efficient, for moving bulk goods over long distances: jet airliners and containerized shipping, respectively."
4749,逃出去的叙利亚人跟随法官哈拉维，于斋月来到巴格达。,"Refugees from Syria reached Baghdad in Ramadan, among them the qadi Abu sa’d al-Harawi."
4749,他们在哈里发的法庭上陈述经过，如泣如诉，感人肺腑。,They told the Caliph’s ministers a story that wrung their hearts and brought tears to their eyes.
4749,星期五，叙利亚人来到大清真寺痛哭求援，讲述伊斯兰教徒在圣城遭受的痛苦：男人被杀，妇女和孩子遇抢被俘，闻者莫不热泪盈眶。,"On Friday they went to the Cathedral Mosque and begged for help, weeping so that their hearers wept with them as they described the sufferings of the Muslims in that Holy City: the men killed, the women and children taken prisoner, the homes pillaged."
4749,他们历经此巨难，因此中断了斋戒。,"Because of the terrible hardships they had suffered, they were allowed to break the fast."
4750,国家受到无数的跨越不同的空间范围的政府间组织（IGOs）、国际机构和体制的挑战。同时还不得不面对诸如欧盟那样的准超国家机构。,"The state is confronted by an enormous number of intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), international agencies and regimes which operate across different spatial reaches, and by quasi-supranational institutions, like the European Union."
4750,非国家主体或超国家实体，例如多国公司、跨国压力集团、跨国职业协会、社会运动等等，也都紧密参与了全球政治。,"Non-state actors ortransnational bodies, such as multinational corporations, transnational pressure groups, transnational professional associations, social movements and so on, also participate intensively in global politics."
4751,货币、政府债券、场内交易衍生品和其他主要的金融产品遍及世界主要的金融中心。,"For currencies, government bonds, exchange-traded derivatives and other leading financial products, trading spans the world's major financial centres."
4751,伦敦、纽约和东京市场联系如此紧密，以至于它们作为全天候单一市场发挥功能。它们占这些资产交易的大部分，并开始为世界价格设定了一个基点。,"The London, New York and Tokyo markets have become so enmeshed that they function as a twenty-four hour single market; they account for the majority of trade in these assets and act to set benchmark world prices."
4752,源于《十二铜表法》的民法也已不能满足后来罗马人的需求，只好由执法官加以修正和增补。,"Civil law derived from the Twelve Tables proved inadequate for later Roman needs, however, and gave way to corrections and additions by the praetors."
4752,就职伊始，执法官就会签署法令，列出处理各种案例的指导纲领。,"On taking office, a praetor issued an edict listing his guidelines for dealing with different kinds of legal cases."
4752,执法官深谙法律，可他在拟订法令时，还需依靠罗马法官(他们也是业余法学专家）提供建议。,"The praetors were knowledgeable in law, but they also relied on Roman jurists---amateur law experts---for advice in preparing their edicts."
4752,法学家的司法解释，常常体现在执法官签发的法令中，这些解释形成了大量的法律条文。,"The interpretations of the jurists, often embodied in the edicts of the praetors, created a body of legal principles."
4753,相互交叉的区域性和全球性安全制度的存在标志着国际安全事务新的历史模式的出现，几乎没有一个国家和地区被排除在现存的国际（区域性和全球性）安全机制之外。,"The existence of overlapping regional and global security regimes defines a new conjuncture in the historical pattern of international security affairs.For few states, and certainly no major global regions, are excluded from participation in existing international (regional and global) security regimes."
4753,另外，这些各种各样体制的制度化及其相互之间的影响有助于全球规制基础结构的形成。尽管其权威有限，它也深深地嵌入（虽然是不均衡的）到世界大多数国家的军事和安全实践中。,"Moreover, the institutionalization of and mutual interaction between these diverse regimes have contributed to the formation of a global regulatory infrastructure which, irrespective of its limited authority, is embedded (however unevenly) in the military and security practices of the majority of the world's states."
4754,总之，在变化着的区域和全球秩序进程和结构中，传统的国家主权和自主概念正在被重新讨论和重新表述。,"In sum, traditional conceptions of state sovereignty and autonomy are being renegotiated and rearticulated within the changing processes and structures of regional and global order."
4754,而且，国家被锁定在多样的、复合的、重叠的政治领域中——我们在前面把它称作多层次治理。,"States, moreover, are locked into diverse, complex overlapping political domains --- what we earlier referred to as multilayered governance."
4754,因此，国家主权和国家自主性必须被视为处在更广泛的治理框架中，在这些框架中，它们只是支持政治权威行使的众多原则之一。,"Thus national sovereignty and national autonomy have to be thought of as embedded within broader frameworks of governance in which they have become but one set of principles, among others, underlying the exercise of political authority."
4755,对于智者来说，没有什么绝对正确和错误的东西——对一个人是正确的东西或许对另一个人就是错误的。,"To the Sophists, there was no absolute right or wrong---what was right for one individual might be wrong for another."
4755,真正的智慧应该是能够觉察并能够满足自己的利益。,True wisdom consisted of being able to perceive and pursue one’s own good.
4755,正是因为他们持有这些思想观点，很多人认为智者有害于社会，尤其是会危及年轻人的价值观念。,"Because of these ideas, many people viewed the Sophists as harmful to society and especially dangerous to the values of young people."
4756,但同样，一国内的中小企业可以通过特许权经营、与其他中小企业合作或者在其中进行有价证券投资等形式向国外扩展，以形成全球生产和销售链。,"But equally SMEs in one country may expand abroad through franchising, or cooperative arrangements with or portfolio investment in other SMEs to form global production and distribution chains."
4756,虽然大的跨国公司一直倾向于控制全球生产和分配系统，但现在并不一定如此。,Although big MNCs have tended to dominate global production and distribution systems this is no longer necessarily the case.
4756,以阿根廷一家小型女内衣零售企亚卡罗·库里（Caro Cuori)为例，其销售额不及福特汽车公司的0.5%，但它已在西班牙、葡萄牙、厄瓜多尔、加拿大、美国和南非等地设有分支机构（Financial Times，10/2/1998，第32页）。,"Take, for instance, Caro Cuori, a small Argentinean lingerie retailer (with sales of less than 0.5 per cent of the Ford Motor company) which has outlets in Spain, Portugal, Ecuador, Canada, the US and South Africa (Financial Times, 10 Feb. 1998, p. 32)."
4757,这种观点与事实明显冲突，即银行和其他金融机构为了其自身的有效运作仍依赖国内的和国际的管理机构。商业银行要求中央银行作为最后贷款人以防银行破产。,Such a view is contradicted by the fact that banks and other financial institutions still rely on national and international regulatory authorities for their effective operation.Commercial banks require central banks to act as lender of last resort to prevent bank collapses.
4757,正像80年代的债务危机和90年代末东亚危机所显示的那样，当银行陷入困境时。经济上最强大的国家（主要是美国）和国际公共机构，如国际货币基金组织，就得介入以阻止金融崩溃。,"As the debt crises of the 1980s and the East Asian crisis of the late 1990s showed, when banks get into difficulties the most economically powerful states (mainly the US) alongside international public authorities, such as the IMF, have to step in to prevent financial collapse."
4758,至少在原则上可以这样假设：客观地找到这些必要条件是可能的——就象生物学家可以客观地找出生物所赖以繁殖、生存的条件一样，比如：需要某种营养、适量的水份等等。,"I assume that, in principle at any rate, it is possible to discover what these requirements really were in the same.objective sense that a biologist can discover for any living organism the conditions necessary for reproduction and survival, such as specific kinds of nourishment, amounts of moisture, and the like."
4758,还有一点应弄清楚：种植园蓄奴制和早期工业资丰主义发展所需要的条件远远超出了经济领域，已涉及到政治制度的问题，蓄奴制社会与自由劳动力社会的政治形式是不同的。,It should also be clear that the requirements or structural imperatives for plantation slavery and early industrial capitalism extend far beyond economic arrangements as such and certainly into the area of political institutions.Slave societies do not have the same political forms as those based on free labor.
4758,现在，还是让我们回到中心问题上来，探究一下南北双方非打不可的原因。,"But, to return to our central question, is that any reason why they have to fight?"
4759,希腊重装步兵是佩带宽大圆盾和长矛的步兵。,The Greek hoplites were infantrymen equipped with large round shields and long thrusting spears.
4759,他们在战斗中严格按方阵行军，只要他们的阵形没有破坏，他们就是很危险的对手。,"In battle, they advanced in tight phalanx formation and were dangerous opponents as long as this formation remained unbroken."
4759,这个公元前7世纪的希腊瓶饰画上描绘的是交战状态下的两支重装步兵。,This vase painting of the seventh century B.C. shows two groups of hoplite warriors engaged in battle.
4759,左边的吹笛者正引领着另一排士兵投入战斗。,The piper on the left is leading another line of soldiers preparing to enter the fray.
4760,到17世纪末，欧洲不再仅仅是一些政治组织的拼凑体，而是逐渐进化为一个“国家社会”，主权原则和领土原则占据了优先地位。,"By the end of the seventeenth century Europe was no longer simply a mosaic of polities, but an evolving 'society of states' in which the principles of sovereignty and territoriality became supreme."
4760,各个单独的国家的权力巩固过程同时也是一个完整的国家间体系形成的过程（Giddens，1985，第91页）。,"The consolidated power of each individual state was at the same time part of the process of overall interstate formation (Giddens, 1985, p. 91)."
4760,因为对每个国家无可争议的权威的承认就是承认其他国家，其他国家在它们自己的疆域内有同等的权利，即自治的权利和要求受到尊重的权利。,For a concomitant of each and every state's claim to uncontestable authority was the recognition that such a claim gave other states an equal entitlement to autonomy and respect within their own borders.
4760,国家主权观念的发展是国家间互相认可过程的核心，由此国家之间互相承认了对方在各自的领土和共同体内的管辖权力。,The development of state sovereignty was central to the process of mutual recognition whereby states granted each other rights of jurisdiction in their respective territories and communities.
4761,全球市场的发展已经导致了国家间的生产专业化，所以，有利可图的生产和无利可图的生产在很大程度上受全球竞争条件的影响。,"The evolution of global markets has led to specialization among countries so that what is profitable to produce, and what is not, is significantly influenced by global competitive conditions."
4761,关键是国家的定位并不是静止不变的：当经济充分发展和需要新技术时，它们的相对位置就会改变。,Crucially the positions of countries are not static: as economies mature and acquire new technology their relative positions change.
4761,因为比较优势的国际模式正随着时间而改变，所以，国内经济面临着重新配置资源的压力，而不仅仅是对贸易增长的简单回应。,"Since international patterns of comparative advantage are shifting over time, national economies face pressures to reallocate resources continually and not just as a one-off response to rising trade."
4761,在这个意义上，贸易对国内经济结构有重要影响。,In this sense trade has significant impacts on the structure of national economies.
4762,王权专制主义能够制服和控制在建立独立经济基础时处境艰难的贵族。,Royal absolutism was able to tame and control an aristocracy that had difficulty in establishing an independent economic base.
4762,正如托克维尔很久以前已认识到的，革命完成了波旁王朝的使命，其结果是右翼独裁统治所必需的社会基础之一被消灭了。这种独裁统治在先进工业浪潮的冲击下会使法西斯倾向达于顶点。,"The Revolution finished the work of the Bourbons, as de Tocqueville recognized long ago.The consequence was the destruction of one of the indispensable social bases of right-wing authoritarian regimes that show a strong tendency to culminate in fascism under the impact of advanced industry."
4763,表4-11详细说明了流向发展中国家和转轨经济体的私人资本。,Table 4.11 details private capital flows to developing countries and to transition economies.
4763,虽然转轨经济体已吸引了相当的份额，但东亚和拉丁美洲仍继续控制着这些流量。,"East Asia and Latin America continue to dominate these flows, although the transition economies have attracted an increasing share."
4763,到90年代末流向发展中国家的私人资本占其国内生产总值或投资的比例高于70年代。,By the late 1990s private capital flows to developing economies were higher relative to either their GDP or investment levels than during the 1970s.
4763,然而，这些流量在1997〜1998年东亚货币危机之后急剧下降。,"However, these flows declined sharply following the East Asian currency crises of 1997-8."
4763,最穷的国家特别是非洲国家的外国直接投资流量仍保持在不及总暈1%的水平。,"FDI flows to the poorest economies, notably in Africa, remain less than 1 per cent of the total."
4764,然而，跨国公司因担心国内税收机构的行为而受到限制，这种行为监控着公司经营（至少从7 0 年代开始）和日常的往来信息。,"However, companies are limited by fear of action by national tax authorities, which have monitored the practice (at least since the 1970s) and regularly exchange information."
4764,再者，转移定价可能会与内部会计和控制机制发生冲突。,"Further, transfer pricing may conflict with internal accounting and control systems."
4764,这些证据表明，转移定价正大规模地实践着，但同利润和政府税收收入相比，其重要性仍是第二位的。,"Such evidence as there is indicates that transfer pricing is practised on a significant scale, but it is of secondary importance to profits and government tax revenues."
4765,关于50年代和60年代闪际金融流动强度的数据很不一致，这表明了其低水平。除一些外国直接投资以外，资本仍然牢牢限于国家边界以内。,"Data on the intensity of international financial flows in the 1950s and 1960s are patchy at best, reflecting its low levels; apart from some FDI, capital remained firmly rooted within national borders."
4765,这并不奇怪，因为存在着国内资本控制并缺乏私人国际资本流动的基础设施；对布雷顿森林体系的研究表明了国家的利率间有重大差异。,This is not surprising given both the existence of national capital controls and the limited infrastructure for private international capitalflows.
4765,"这反映了国内资本控制影响的性质 (Dooley 1980; Marston, 1993)。","Studies of the BWS indicate a significant divergence between countries' interest rates, reflecting the impact of national capital controls (Dooley and Isard, 1980; Marston, 1993)."
4766,在18世纪，英国和法国的势力不断增强。而到了 19世纪，则是英国处于霸主地位。,"British and French influence were ascendant in the eighteenth century, and Britain was quite dominant in the nineteenth."
4766,"“可能是因为它们主要是围绕着英国发展起来的”，正如霍布斯鲍姆（Hobsbawrn)所说的那样，“19世纪的资本主义世界经济在自由流动的单一体系中发展了起来，在这一体系中，资本和商品 的国际交换主要是通过英国及其机构来进行的，通过航行于各大洲之间的英国远洋货轮来运输货物，并以英国的货币单位作为标准计算单位”（1969,第14页，Cf.第314页)。","""Perhaps because it was so largely built round Britain,"" as Hobsbawm put it, ""the world economy of nineteenth-century capitalism developed as a single system of free flows, in which the international transfers of capital and commodities passed largely through British hands and institutions, in British ships between the continents, and were calculated in terms of the pound sterling"" (1969, p. 14, cf. p. 314)."
4767,共同遗产概念的关键要素包括：占有权的排他性；为了人类的利益开发资源的责任；以及只为了和平的目的而开发和利用资源的责任（Cassese，1986，第390页）。,"Among the key elements of the concept of the common heritage are the exclusion of a right of appropriation; the duty to exploit resources in the interest of humankind; and the duty to explore and utilize resources for peaceful purposes only (Cassese, 1986, p. 390)."
4767,共同遗产概念的引入指出了基于平等与合作的法律秩序的可能性。,The introduction of the concept of the common heritage points to the possibility of a legal order based on equity and cooperation.
4767,尽管对于这一原则确切地应该在哪里、怎样被运用，以及由开发新资源所增加的利益应如何分配等问题还存在着大量的争论，但这一概念的引入却是国际法律思想的一个转折点。,"Although there is still a great deal of argument as to exactly where and how this principle should be applied, and how the benefits accruing from the exploitation of new resources should be distributed, the introduction of the concept was a turning point in international legal thinking."
4768,身为天子的万历，在另一种意义上讲，他不过是紫禁城中的一名囚徒。,He began to realize that he was less the Ruler of All Men than a prisoner of the Forbidden City.
4768,他的权力大多带有被动性。,His power was basically negative.
4768,他可以把他不喜欢的官员革职查办，但是很难升迁拔擢他所喜欢的官员，以致没有一个人足以成为他的心腹。,"He could remove or punish an official or a group of officials, but he could hardly promote a favorite or grant him an unusual honor."
4769,在《物种起源》一书中，达尔文只讨论了植物和动物的物种。,"In On the Origin of Species, Darwin discussed plant and animal species only."
4769,他最初并未考虑人类的问题，只是到后来才将其自然选择的理论应用于人类。,He was not concerned with human beings and only later applied his theory of natural selection to humans.
4769,在发表于1871年的《人类的由来及性选择》一书中，达尔文提出了人类的动物起源：“人与其他的哺乳动物一样，是一个共同祖先的后代。”,"In The Descent of Man, published in 1871, he argued for the animal origins of human beings: “Man is the co-descendant with other mammals of a common progenitor.”"
4770,20多年来，矿物储备、有机原材料祜竭以及动植物物种的灭绝一直是环境保护主义者最为关心的问题。,The exhaustion of mineral reserves and organic raw materials and the extinction of plant and animal species have been a preoccupation of environmentalists for over two decades.
4770,当然，正如第8.2节中指出的，真正的资源枯竭和短缺问题有着深远的原因。,"Of course, as argued in section 8.2, the practical problem of resource depletion and shortages has a long pedigree."
4770,根据观察者的描述和我们对价格数据（这些数据反映出即将到来的或实际的资源短缺）的分析，无论在定量还是在定性上，我们都有足够的证据来说明前现代时期存在严重的资源短缺。,"We have ample evidence, both quantitative and qualitative, of severe resource shortages in premodern societies through both observers' accounts and the analysis of price statistics which reflect impending and actual shortages."
4770,然而，只是在70年代早期，随着罗马俱乐部的《增长的极限》以及“生态学家”的《生存蓝图》的出版，自然资源的有限性质才被明确提到环境议事日程上来（Meadows等，1972；《生态学家1972)。,"However, it was in the early 1970s, with the publication of the Club of Rome's Limits to Growth and The Ecologist's Blueprint for Survival, that the finite nature of natural resources was brought firmly on to the environmental agenda (Meadows et al.,1972; The Ecologist, 1972)."
4771,到70年代，在几乎所有的经合发国家都建立了高度自由的贸易秩序。80年代以来，这种由贸易秩序扩展到发展中国家，以及前苏联和东欧国家：结果是现在存在着一个全球贸易体制。,"By the 1970s a largely free trade order had been established among all the OECD countries and since the 1980s this has been extended to developing countries and countries formerly closed to trade under communism, with the result that a global trading system now exists."
4771,从历史上看，贸易保护程度低于以前时代，而贸易自由化可能会继续发展。,"Historically, protection levels are lower than in previous eras while trade liberalization is likely to continue."
4771,贸易水平无论在绝对数量上还是在占产出比例上都更高。,"Trade levels are higher, both absolutely and in relation to output, than ever before."
4772,主要的变化发生在一些较大的并多少有些向外扩张的农村地区，这里的人其地位一般在贵族之下而在自由民（即绅士）之上，他们有着更强烈的进取心，成功地适应了新的情况。,
4772,,"The main rural body whose more enterprising members adapted successfully was that large and somewhat diffuse body below the peerage and above the yeomanry, in other words, the gentry."
4772,但是，由于农业活动的孤立性，他们的成功并不是完全的。,But their success was not entirely due to agricultural activities alone.
4772,那些看来走在前面的绅士们同上层市民以及资产阶级（就这一术语已经被接受的狭意来说）有着各种各样的个人的或商业方面的联系。,The gentry who looked ahead had all sorts of personal and business connections with the upper ranks of the townsmen or bourgeoisie in the accepted narrower sense of the term.
4773,最近的这次民主化浪潮帮助确立了自由民主在世界许多地区的主导地位。,The most recent wave helped secure a dominant position for liberal democracy across many of the world's regions.
4773,在1974年，世界上至少有68%的国家可以被合乎情理地称作是威权主义国家；而到了1995年末，将近75%的国家已经建立了竞争性选举的程序，并采纳了对政治权利和公民权利的一些正式的保护措施。,"In 1974 at least 68 per cent of all countries could reasonably be called authoritarian; by the end of 1995, nearly 75 per cent of all countries had established procedures for competitive elections and adopted some formal guarantees of political and civil rights."
4773,在现阶段，采取自由民主形式的国家的数目看起来仍然在增长。,"At the current juncture, the number of liberal democracies appears to be still growing."
4774,自由主义是众多意识形态中的一种，它从18世纪的启蒙运动及18世纪后期的美国、法国革命中吸取了很多东西。,"One of these ideologies was liberalism, which owed much to the Enlightenment of the eighteenth century and the American and French Revolutions at the end of that century."
4774,自由主义的一个基本信仰就是，人们应该尽可能地不受限制。,It was based on the belief that people should be as free from restraint as possible.
4774,这种理念在经济自由主义和政治自由主义中都体现得很明显。,This opinion is evident in both economic and political liberalism.
4775,"民族和人口的大规模移动有着极其悠久的历史（Fagan, 1990; Emmer, 1993)。","The large-scale movement of people and peoples has an enormously long history (Fagan, 1990; Emmer, 1993)."
4775,自从6000年前最早的初级形态的国家出现以来，人类迁移已经跨越了政治界限并扩展和重新塑造了新的政治界限。,Since the emergence of the first rudimentary states over six thousand years ago human migrations have crossed political boundaries as well as extending and reshaping them.
4775,流动的迁移者已经跨越了大洲并开创了新帝国。,Mobile nomads have crossed continents and carved out new empires.
4775,一些原有的政体获得了一种内在的动力，使得它们可以从中心向外国发展。,Some older polities have acquired an internal dynamism that allowed them to push outwards from the centre.
4775,宗教和经济推动了传教士和商人跨越大洲。,Religion and economics have propelled missionaries and merchants across continents.
4776,尽管大流士没有引入省区制，但他确实看到这种体系组织更加合理。,"Although Darius had not introduced the system of satrapies, he organized it more rationally."
4776,他创立了一套控制岁入的合理制度，即每个总督归属中央政府，并规定各个省区特定的民事与军事义务。,He created a sensible system for calculating the tribute that each satrapy owed to the central government and gave satraps specific civil and military duties.
4776,他们收取贡赋，负责司法和治安，为帝国军队征兵，在其辖区内例行统领军事力量。,"They collected tributes, were responsible for justice and security, raised military levies for the royal army, and normally commanded the military forces within their satrapies."
4776,就实际权力而言，这些总督也有类似于帝王的宫廷，俨然是帝国中的小王国。,"In terms of real power, the satraps were miniature kings with courts imitative of the Great King’s."
4777,埃塞俄比亚东北部荒芜的达那基尔洼地阿法尔民族提供了一个专门化的例子。,One example of specialization is afforded by the Afar people of Ethiopia's Danakil Depression.
4777,阿法尔人是盐矿开采者，从古代以来，一直在东非从事盐的贸易。,"Afar men are miners of salt, which since ancient times has been widely traded in East Africa."
4777,盐是从广阔的盐原地表上开采得到的，采到盐是既有风险又很艰难的事。,"It is mined from the crust of an extensive salt plain in the north part of the depression, and ro get it is a risky and difficult business."
4778,分清人类学中三种比较类型（参见Sarana 1975):案例比较、 全球比较和控制比较（包括区域比较），是很有用的。,"It is useful to distinguish three types of comparison in anthropology (see Sarana 1975): illustrative, global, and controlled (which includes regional comparison)."
4778,案例比较（Illustrative comparison)需要选择一些实例来分析文化差异或相似之处。,Illustrative comparison involves choosing examples to make some point about cultural difference or similarity.
4778,它是许多人类学导论教学的基础。,This is the basis of much introductory teaching in anthropology.
4779,这一种族思维方式，在19世纪和20世纪初期达到顶峰，但它并没有就此消失。,"This racial way of thinking reached its peak in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but it is by no means dead."
4779,种族主义至今仍在世界各地流行，不论是在美国的白人与黑人、澳大利亚人与澳洲土著、华人与马来人中，还是在印度婆罗门与贱民之间。,"Racism is rife throughout the world, whether among American whites describing blacks; Australians, the Aborigines; Chinese, the Malays; or Hindu Brahmins, the ""untouchables."""
4779,种族解释模式经常没有恶意地出现于大众文化中。,The racial mode of explanation appears constantly and innocently in popular culture.
4779,例如，《收视指南》上在解释20世纪七八十年代当红女歌手盖尔（Crystal Gayle)的个性时，将其归因于“切罗基印第安人和爱尔兰血液在她的血液中奔流”。,"An issue of TV Guide, for example, explains the personality of singer Crystal Gayle as being due to ""Cherokee Indian and Irish blood coursing through her veins."" "
4780,而要决定边界线应该划到哪里，是否举行投票，在哪儿举行投票，争议都很大。,"The question of whether, and where, to hold such plebiscites is extremely controversial."
4780,通常认为，自决原则有导致“巴尔干化”的危险。,The principle of self-determination is commonly said to lead to the danger of ‘balkanisation’.
4780,事实上，它正是导致大群体分裂为小群体的主要因素，这也是1945年之后当代国际政治的一个显著特征——总体上不是一个消极的进展。,"It has indeed been a major contributory factor in the process of ""fission of larger units into smaller ones which has been such a notable feature of international politics in the post-1945 period – not in principle a negative development."
4781,如果整个社今只分成两个主要的继嗣群体，无论它们是相尚于氏族或联族，还是牵涉到甚至更无所不包的层次，那么其中每一个群体就叫作半偶族（moiety）（因法语“一半”这个单词得名）。,"If the entire society is divided into only two major descent groups, whether they are equivalent to clans or phratries or involve an even more all-inclusive level, each group is called a moiety (after the French word for ""half"")."
4781,半偶族的成员相信他们自己拥有一个共同的袓先，但无法通过确切的系谱联系证明。,Moiety members also believe they share a common ancestor but cannot prove it through definite genealogical links.
4781,一般而言，世系群和氏族成员的亲属感情要比联族和半偶族成员亲属感情更强。,"As a rule, the feelings of kinship among members of lineages and clans are stronger than those of members of phratries and moieties."
4781,这可能由于后者的规模更大，而且更分散。,This may be due to the larger size and more diffuse nature of the latter groups.
4782,不用说，在北美社会，包办婚姻不是常见的事情，但它们的确也发生了。,"Arranged marriages, needless to say, are not commonplace in North American society, but they do occur."
4782,"在少数民族中，人们可能致力于保护传统价值,他们担忧要不然的话，传统也许会丧失。","Among ethnic minorities, they may serve to preserve traditional values people fear might otherwise be lost."
4782,在富贵又有权力的家族中，婚姻可能是这样包办的：他们把自己的儿女隔离在私立学校中，小心翼翼地引导他们走向“合适的”婚姻。,"Among families of wealth and power, marriages may be arranged by segregating their children in private schools and carefully steering them toward ""proper"" marriages."
4783,这里举例证明的一般问题，是通常所说的“保健实施”。,"The general problem exemplified here is sometimes termed ""health care delivery""."
4783,有时可利用的医疗技术也会遇到文化抵抗。,Available medical techniques meet cultural resistance.
4783,例如，一项在迈阿密多种族人群中进行的医疗保健研究显示了使用诊所和医院的文化及物理阻碍。,"A study of health care among varied ethnic groups in Miami, for example, showed cultural as well as physical barriers to using clinics and hospitals."
4783,对马萨诸塞一女性主义诊所的人类学研究表明，女性主义运动的文化模型会怎样影响医疗保健实施。,An anthropological study of a feminist clinic in Massachusetts showed how the cultural patterning of the feminist movement affected health-care delivery.
4783,一项对埃及工人阶级妇女的人类学研究表明，她们对身体独特的文化想象，怎样影响其对避孕药品的使用。,An anthropological study of working-class women in Egypt showed how their distinctive cultural images of the body affected use of contraceptives.
4784,在有关著作中，这两种环境决定论的分歧主要表现在：一种观点认为环境可以适应当代的工业社会结构，而另一种则要求从根本上改变这种社会结构（Milbrath 1984:72)。,The most pervasive distinction in the literature is between an environmentalism which can be accommodated within the structures of contemporary industrial society and one which demands fundamental change to those structures (Milbrath 1984:72).
4784,在这个意义上，把这两种环境决定论区分为“保守派”和“激进派”是有益的；“保守主义”和“激进主义”的本质似乎是经常通过细微的、渐进的方式从一种分析视角转向另一种分析视角，甚至是在一种分析视角内相互变换。,"In this sense it is useful to speak of the two environmentalisms as ""conservative"" and ""radical""; it is the nature of the conservatism and radicalism that appears to shift, often in quite subtle ways, from one analytical perspective to another, or even within a single analysis."
4784,阔特格如夫（Cotgmve)对这两种环境决定论（包括保守主义者和保护主义者）作了如下区分：一种观点不反对主流经济价值体系的主导地位，另一种则希望以“福利价值体系取代与纯经济目的不相协调或冲突的经济价值体系”(Cotgrove 1976:24)。,"Cotgrove made a distinction between those environmentalists (including conservationists and preservationists) whose policies offer no challenge to the dominant economic value system, and those who would wish to replace economic goals with ""welfare values which are incompatible with or in conflict with purely economic ends"" (Cotgrove 1976:24)."
4785,不同的民族志游戏规则正在世界的许多地方出现。,Different rules of the game for ethnography are now emerging in many parts of the world.
4785,一个研究美洲土著文化的外来者可能期待——也许作为继续研究的必要条件——为支持土著的土地要求而在诉讼中作证。,"An outsider studying Native American cultures may expect, perhaps as a requirement for continuing research, to testify in support of land claim litigation."
4785,国家和地方的本土政府如今对民族志的田野工作提出了各种各样的正式限制。,And a variety of formal restrictions are now placed on fieldwork by indigenous governments at national and local levels.
4785,上述情况以新的方式决定了关于特定的人什么能够说，特别是什么不能说。,"These condition in new ways what can, and especially cannot, be said about particular peoples."
4785,一类新人物出现了，那就是“本土民族志学者”（Fahim，ed.1982；Ohnuki-Tierney l984）。,"A new figure has entered the scene, the ""indigenous ethnographer"" (Fahim, ed. 1982; Ohnuki-Tierney 1984)."
4785,研究自己的文化的局内人提供了新的视角和理解的深度。,Insiders studying their own cultures offer new angles of vision a n d depths of understanding.
4785,以独特的方式，他们的叙述既获得了力量也受到限制。,Their accounts are empowered and restricted in unique ways.
4786,更为特别的是，人文主义使人类学摆脱了本质论的禁锢，例如“文化”、“性别”和“种族”。,"In particular, humanism offers anthropology an escape from imprisoning essentialisms such as ‘culture’, ‘gender’ and ‘race’."
4786,这些概念在人类学话语中是构建异己性的手段：在人之间找出差异并进行区分，从而不可避免地造成等级性和不平等。,For these concepts have operated in anthropological discourse as means of making alterity: creating differences between people and enforcing separations which have come to imply inevitable hierarchy and inequality.
4786,在这一分类（“文化”、“性别”和“种族”）的内部同样存在着同质性、连续性和确定性。,"Sameness within the category (‘culture’, ‘gender’, ‘race’), meanwhile, has come to imply inexorable homogeneity, coherence and determination."
4787,就像普遍主义（共性论）补充了特殊主义（个性论），比较方法则补充了田野工作。,"The comparative method complements fieldwork, just as universalism complements particularism."
4787,在民族志的比较方法中，民族志学者分析了许多相互联系的文化，而不是集中分析一个特定的文化或一种特定的情况。,"In the comparative method of ethnography the ethnographer analyzes many cultures in relation to one another, rather than focusing on a particular culture or situation."
4787,与田野工作一样，比较方法也是很难真正做到的。,"Like fieldwork, the comparative method is difficult."
4787,它并不是简单地欢呼全球多样性，例如享受食物市场或国际节日。,"It is not simply a celebration of global variety, such as is enjoyed in food fairs or international festivals."
4787,那些背景设置试图将多样性统一起来，但是它们也呈现出一种经常是混乱的混合物。,"Those settings attempt to unite diversities, but they also present an often confusing mixture."
4788,尽管目前在象征人类学和比较符号学领域涌现出很多优秀的专著和论文，但是针对同一主题的系列丛书的出版及其所能引起的共同关注和讨论目前还不多见。,"Although excellent individual monographs and articles in symbolic anthropology or comparative symbology have recently appeared, a common focus or forum that can be provided by a topically organized series of books has not been available."
4788,因此，这套丛书的出版意在弥补这一空缺。,The present series is intended to fill this lacuna.
4788,这套丛书不仅计划收录人类学家的田野专著、理论著述以及比较研究，而且还包括其他学科学者的作品，其中既有科学类的也有人文类的。,"It is designed to include not only field monographs and theoretical and comparative studies by anthropologists, but also work by scholars in other disciplines, both scientific and humanistic."
4789,一些学者的著作中表现出与英国进化论的连接，但最明显的是在德籍英国东方学学者弗里德里克·马克斯· 缪勒的著作中。,"The connection to British evolutionism runs through the work of several scholars, but none as obviously as that of the German-British orientalist, Friedrich Max Müller."
4789,在其教父费利克斯· 门德尔松劝诫下，年轻的缪勒放弃学习音乐，转而学习梵语，他先在莱比锡求学，后到柏林转投博普门下。,"Dissuaded by his godfather Felix Mendelssohn from studying music, the young Max Müller turned to Sanskrit, first at Leipzig and then, under Bopp, at Berlin."
4789,1846 年，缪勒进入牛津大学深造，并最终在那里确立了自己在现代语言和比较语言学领域中的地位。,"In 1846 further studies took him to Oxford, where he settled and eventually took up chairs in modern languages and comparative philology."
4790,团体的暴力是20世纪90年代印度的特点，带来了持续增长的针对妇女的暴力，以陪葬、殉夫、使用羊水穿刺限制女婴人数的形式表现出来。,"The communal violence which characterises India in the 1990s has brought with it increasing violence against women in the form of dowry deaths, sati and the use of amniocentesis as a way of limiting the numbers of female children."
4790,印度教原教旨主义者描画了一个丰富多彩的、性别的神话。,Hindu fundamentalists have drawn on a rich and gendered mythology.
4790,他们诉诸武装反对敌人伊斯兰世界，保卫自己的祖国和妇女的纯洁：她们是边界的护卫者，传统的承载者，但也是必须加以控制的潜在的敌人。,"Their call to arms against the enemy, Islam, is in defence of the motherland and the purity of its women: they are the boundary keepers, the bearers of tradition, but also potentially the enemy within who must be kept under supervision."
4791,"他也反对“ 文化的科学” 的观点 ( Radcliffe - Brown 1957 : 106 - 9; cf 1957 : 117 -  23)  ,  并含蓄地扞击博厄斯对此的强调。",He also rejected the idea of a ‘science of culture’ (1957: 106–9; cf. 1957: 117–23) and implicitly attacked the Boasian emphasis on this.
4791,对他来说，博厄斯人类学中真正重要的是“社会”（作为人们彼此间的关系），不属于“文化”的变幻莫测，是不能被科学分析的。这是当时美国占  据统治地位的观点。,"What really mattered to him was that in Boasian anthropology, the dominant version in America at the time, ‘society’ (as relations between people) was lost to the vagaries of ‘culture’, which could not be analysed scientifically."
4791,与博厄斯及其追随者的文化概念不同，拉德克  利夫－布朗的“ 文化” 概念本质上是濡化 ( enculturation ) 或（更确切说） 社会化 ( socialization ）的同义词， 即习得如何在一个社会中生存的途径。,"In fairness to Boas and his followers though, Radcliffe-Brown’s notion of ‘culture’ was essentially synonymous with enculturation or (more accurately) socialization: a way of learning to live in a society."
4792,1992年，一个名为“生物人类学中的政治-经济方法”的研讨会的组织者艾伦˙古德曼（Alan Goodman) 和托马斯·莱瑟曼 （Thomas Leatherman) 希望扭转这一趋势。,"The organizers of a 1992 symposium on ""Political-Economic Approaches in Biological Anthropology,"" Alan Goodman and Thomas Leatherman, hoped to reverse this trend."
4792,他们希望促进对“当地文化和历史情境中”的生物学容量和福利的研究，“它们反过来也受到跨区域和全球进程的形塑并且与之发生互动。,"They wanted to foster the study of biological capacities and well-being in the ""context of local cultures and histories, which in turn are shaped by and interact with interregional and global processes."""
4792,”他们是少数开始注意到“外界的刺激因素通过了一个文化过滤器并且与社会不平等密切相连”的生物人类学家。,They are among a small number of biological anthropologists who are beginning to see that stressors move through a cultural filter and are intimately linked with social inequality.
4792,这门子学科的主流倾向于贬低这样的观点，认为它们不合适地将政治注人科学中。,The mainstream of the subdiscipline has tended to discount such views as inappropriately injecting politics into science.
4793,称民族志为虚构（fictions)可能会激怒经验主义者。,To call ethnographies fictions may raise empiricist hackles.
4793,但是近年的文本理论很普遍地使用的这个词，已经没有了虚假、不过是真理的对立面这样的含义。,"But the word as commonly used in recent textual theory has lost its connotation of falsehood, of something merely opposed to truth."
4793,它表达了文化和历史真理的不完全性（partiality)，暗示出它们是如何成为系统化的和排除了某些事物的。,"It suggests the partiality of cultural and historical truths, the ways they are systematic and exclusive."
4793,民族志写作可以被很正确地称为虚构，在“制作或塑造出来的东西”——这个词的拉丁文词根“fingere”的主要含义——的意义上。,"Ethnographic writings can properly be called fictions in the sense of ""something made or fashioned,"" the principal burden of the word's Latin root, fingere."
4793,但保存此词中不仅是制造而且是捏造、是发明并非真实的事物这样的意义也是很重要的。,"But it is important to preserve the meaning not merely of making, but also of makingup, of inventing things not actually real."
4793,（“fingere”的某些用法暗含着一定程度的虚假的意思。）,"(Fingere, in some of its uses, implied a degree of falsehood.)"
4794,假如它们不是族性的组成部分，那么它们是什么特性的基础？,"And if they were not the ingredients of ethnicity, what identities did they underlie?"
4794,科恩的质疑强化了来自非洲自身的另一个更古老的质疑。在1984年，我在赞比亚发表了一个有关部族制 (tribalism)发明的讲演。,"Cohen's challenge reinforces an older challenge from within Africa itself.In 1984, I gave a lecture in Zambia about the invention of tribalism."
4794,在听众散场时，我听到那位赞比亚的人文科学系主任对同僚说，“那时我们是谁?,"As the audience filed out, I heard the Zambian Dean of Arts say to a colleague, ""Who were we then?"""
4794,”一旦族性被想象 (imagined)出来，它的确像是原生的，而且想象之前的任何身份都变得不可能。,"Once it has been imagined, ethnicity certainly seems primordial, and it becomes impossible to conceive of any prior identity."
4795,根据神话所说，当多贡人在如今他们居住的地方安定下来的时候，每个村子都是由一些兄弟建立的，这些兄弟是如今的一个或几个宗族的祖先（Beaudoin 1984）。,"When the Dogon settled where they live now, according to the myth, each village was founded by several brothers, who were the ancestors of one or several present-day clans (Beaudoin 1984)."
4795,一个祖先的所有后代居住在同一个小村里，叫做吉那（ginna）。,"All the descendants of an ancestor live in the same hamlet, called a ginna."
4795,“吉那”这个单词与宗族的土地、宗族的首领吉那巴那（ginna bana） 居住的家庭房屋以及与各个家户居住的较小房屋等有关。,"The word ginna is used about the clan's land, about the family house where the clan chief (ginna bana) lives and about the smaller houses where the households are based."
4795,大多数土地是被管理起来的，并且由吉那巴那在家户的头领们中间进行分配。,"Most of the land is administered, and distributed among the heads of household, by the ginna bana."
4795,因而，“吉那”这个概念把人类学家所谓的财产、居住地、社会权利和义务，以及政治等集合在一个简单的家族关系术语中。,"The concept of ginna thus groups what anthropologists see as property, place of residence, social rights and duties, and politics, in a single kinship term."
4795,只有男人和他们的孩子才是家系的成员。,Only men and their children are members of the lineage.
4795,妻子/母亲属于另外的不同中心的家系。,The wives/mothers belong to other lineages which are centred elsewhere.
4795,婚姻通常由两位父亲组织起来，他们用这种方式加强了友谊的非正式纽带。,"Marriage is usually organised by the two fathers, who strengthen informal ties of friendship in this way."
4796,其二，在酋邦和国家中，经授权的第三方可公布具有约束力的决定，而争端双方不得不尊重这一决定。,"Second, in chiefdoms and states, an authorized third party may issue a binding decision the disputing parties will be compelled to respect."
4796,这一过程被称为裁决(adjudication)。调解和裁决之间的区别从根本上说在于授权。,This process is referred to as adjudication.The difference between mediation and adjudication is basically a difference in authorization.
4796,在裁决解决争端中，争端各方都尽可能强硬地坚持 自己的立场，但他们不参与最终裁决。,"In a dispute settled by adjudication, the disputing parties present their positions as convincingly as they can, but they do not participate in the ultimate decision making."
4797,在一些社会，置办嫁妆成了一个相当大的经济负担。,"In some societies, the payment of dowry entails a considerable economic burden."
4797,与女儿出嫁相关的费用是导致印度的杀死女婴高比率的一个主要原因。,The costs associated with daughters getting married are a main cause of the high rates of female infanticide in India.
4797,在许多社会，尤其是非洲，彩礼（有时被叫做聘金）比嫁妆更为常见。,"Bridewealth (sometimes spoken of as ""bride-price"") is more common than dowry in many societies, particularly in Africa."
4797,在此，新郎的家族不得不转让一些资源给新娘的家族，作为对拥有新娘的劳动力和生殖力的一种回报。,Here the groom's kin is obliged to transfer resources to the bride's kin in return for his rights to her labour and reproductive powers.
4797,彩礼的给付使男人对女人及其孩子拥有了权利。,The payment of bridewealth establishes the rights of the man in the woman and her children.
4798,然而，历史上更为常见的是，形式上的停滞与个体的创造发明并存。,"More historically usual, however, is the situation of formal inertia and individual invention proceeding side by side."
4798,因此，当文化形式“凝固”且变得独立时，就会从创造它们的力量中分离出来，使得世界中充满着习惯，而个体也就会创造出新的形式，为世界带来进一步的变化和变迁。,"Hence, as cultural forms ‘congeal’ and become independent, detached from the energies which produced them, and fill the world with habit, individuals are also creating new forms, and causing a world of further heterogeneity and flux.New energies, not incorporatable within old forms, create new forms."
4798,在形式的混乱中要发生这些，首先要求，个体有可能在众多相互竞争的选择中（宗教和科学；弗洛伊德和荣格的心理分析；积家、阿曼尼和马莎的服饰；曼城、曼联、狼队和系伯尼安等足球队）进行筛选；并且把这些形式按照一定的顺序和频率组织起来，形成新的产成品（拉康心理分析；朋克服饰）。,"This happens as, first, amid the clutter of forms, individuals have the possibility of choosing between a number of often competing options (religion and science; Freudian and Jungian psychoanalysis; Jaeger, Armani and St Michael tailoring; Manchester City, Man. Utd, Wolves and Hibernian football); and also of putting these formstogether in a sequence and frequency which amounts to a new bricolage (Lacanian psychoanalysis; Punk tailoring)."
4799,韦伯对有关“阐释”（Verstehen)的性质的早期争论也有贡献，他的文章讨论了价值、客观性和原因解释。,"Weber made contributions to early debates on the nature of ‘interpretation’ (Verstehen), and his writings consider values, objectivity, and causal explanation."
4799,他的思想为后来的人类学家所采用，其中包括20世纪50年代的曼彻斯特学派，该学派至今仍然对人类学界有所影响。,"His ideas were picked up by anthropologists, including those of the Manchester School in the 1950s, and they still influence anthropology today."
4799,从韦伯的社会学中，互动论和阐释主义者都可以找到其思想的重要因素的根源。,Both transactionalists and interpretivists derive important elements of their thinking from their roots in Weberian sociology.
4800,有时，这个包含了进化论和传播论的较大的理论观点被称为历时性观点（意指跨越时间的事物之间的联系）。,Sometimes the larger perspective which embraces both evolutionism and diffusionism is called the diachronic one (indicating the relation of things through time).
4800,其对立面是共时性观点（意指同一时间存在的事物之间的联系）。,Its opposite is the synchronic perspective (indicating the relation of things together in the same time).
4800,共时性研究包括功能主义、结构主义、阐释主义，以及其他试图在不涉及时间前提下解释特定文化运作的研究。,"Synchronic approaches include functionalism, structuralism, interpretivism, and other ones which try to explain the workings of particular cultures without reference to time."
4801,尽管这些态度很顽固，但正在慢慢消失。,"Such attitudes, though they persist, are diminishing."
4801,今天，很少有人类学家会接受那种民族志逻辑，它在弗朗兹˙博厄斯时代被阐述为决定生死的急救手术。,"Few anthropologists today would embrace the logic of ethnography in the terms in which it was enunciated in Franz Boas's time, as a last-chance rescue operation."
4801,然而，关于抢救的寓言却根深蒂固。,But the allegory of salvage is deeply ingrained.
4801,事实上，我即将论证，它是作为一种写作，尤其是作为文本化的过程被添造进民族志的构思和实践中的。,"Indeed, I shall argue in a moment that it is built into the conception and practice of ethnography as a process of writing, specifically of textualization."
4801,每一种将自己设想成“让文化变成写作”的描述或解释，从口头上东拉西扯的经验（“本地人”的田野工作者的）发展到这种经验的完成版本（民族志文本），都在制定着“抢救”的结构。,"Every description or interpretation that conceives itself as ""bringing a culture into writing, ""moving from oral-discursive experience (the ""native's,"" the fieldworker's) to a written version of that experience (the ethnographic text) is enacting the structure of ""salvage."""
4801,从民族志过程被视为铭写（而不是，例如抄写或对话）的角度看，表述将继续制定一种有效的、有问题的、寓言性的结构。,"To the extent that the ethnographic process is seen as inscription (rather than, for example, as transcription, or dialogue) the representation will continue to enact a potent, and questionable, allegorical structure."
4802,尽管只有凯卢瓦和莱利斯是莫斯的嫡传弟子，但他们所有人都受到了莫斯和赫兹对象征符号和仪式的研究，以及莫斯倡导的新法国民族志的极大鼓舞。,"They were all greatly inspired by Mauss's and Hertz's work on symbols and rituals, as well as by the new French ethnography initiated by Mauss, though only Caillois and Leiris were directly Mauss's students."
4802,甚至也是这两个人与艾尔弗雷德·梅特罗一道，促使巴塔耶在对文学和哲学的兴趣之外，对社会学也产生了兴趣。,"Indeed, it was these two, together with Alfred Métraux, who led Bataille to add sociology to his existing interests in literature and philosophy."
4802,莱利斯和凯卢瓦早期还涉猎过超现实主义，后来又抛开了它；而巴塔耶对这一运动一点也不感兴趣。,"Leiris and Caillois also flirted early on with surrealism, but later broke with it; Bataille was never interested in that movement."
4803,它既不以科学话语的方式来自我完善，也不以政治话语的方式来总体化；它既不被一种对其自身规则的反思性关注所限定；也不被这些规则的表述手段所限定。,"Neither self-perfecting in the manner of scientific discourse nor totalizing in the manner of political discourse, it is defined neither by a reflexive attention to its own rules nor by the performative instrumentality of those rules."
4803,既不被形式也不被与一个外部客体的关系所限定；它既不产生形式与表演的理念化，也不产生虚构的现实或现实的虚构化。,"Defined neither by form nor by relation to an external object, it produces no idealizations of form and performance, no fictionalized realities or realities fictionalized."
4803,"它的超越性不是一种元语言——因更完美的形式而优越的语言——的超越,不是由综合和扬弃所创造的统一体的超越，也不是实践和实际运用的超越。","Its transcendence is not that of a meta-language — of a language superior by means of its greater perfection of form — nor that of a unity created by synthesis and sublation, nor of praxis and practical application."
4803,于是，超越，既不通过理论，也不通过实践，也不通过它们的综合；它不描写知识也不生产行动。,"Transcendent then, neither by theory nor by practice, nor by their synthesis, it describes no knowledge and produces no action."
4803,它是通过唤起（evoking)那些不能以话语的方式来认识或完美地表现的东西来超越，尽管所有的人似乎都以话语的方式来认识它，似乎都完美地表现它。,"It transcends instead by evoking what cannot be known discursively or performed perfectly, though all know it as if discursively and perform it as if perfectly."
4804,它是几条河道中最大的河流，流过有很多可狩猎野兽的森林。,"The largest of a number of watercourses, it flowed through forests abounding with game."
4804,就像人一样，每个动物也由躯体和灵魂构成。,"Like humans, each animal also was composed of a body and a spirit."
4804,与这些动物一起还有各种水居的、山居的或自由出没于森林的准人类的超自然存在物。在这些超自然存在物中，格鲁斯卡比由于杀死了过去垄断了世界水供应的贪得无厌的巨大青蛙而创造了这条极其重要的佩诺布斯科特河。,"Along with the animals were various quasi-human supernatural beings that inhabited bodies of water and mountains or roamed freely through the forest.One of these, Gluskabe, created the all-important Penobscot River by deceiving a greedy giant frog that had monopolized the world's water supply."
4805,在第一种类型中，人不自觉地把自己投射到外部世界之中，依据他自己的精神过程描述和解释世界。,"In the first type, man unconsciously projects himself into the external world, describing and interpreting it in terms of his own psychic processes."
4805,全部世界因而被当作是有生命的和由像人那样感觉和行事的神灵们栖息着.,The whole world is thus made alive and peopled with spirits who feel and behave as men do.
4805,这些神灵像人那样有其愿望，喜爱某些食物和饮料；他们性喜嫉妒，易于接受阿谀奉承；他们互相争斗而又彼此相爱。,"They have desires like men, show preferences for certain foods and drink; they are susceptible to jealousy and flattery; they fight and make love."
4805,一位神灵创造了世界，另一位则带来甘露，而第三位为这个世界带来欢乐，使百物生长。,"One spirit makes the earth, another brings rain, a third sends game or brings forth crops."
4805,这些神灵支持或反对某呰经济和政治制度，井且对那些他们中意的国家的军队给予援助。,"The gods favor or oppose certain types of economic and pohtical systems, and aid the armies of their chosen nations."
4805,这样，人按照他自己的形象创造出一个世界，这就是超自然主义的、泛灵论和拟人论的哲学。,Thus man creates the world in his own image.This is the philosophy of supernaturalism : of animism and anthropomorphism.
4806,因此，共同体以及朝圣语境中的记忆并没有将社会和文化结构加以摒弃，而是缓解了结构所产生的各种分歧和差异的对立性和不相容性，各种群体以及各种对立的关系从而被很好地整合在一个复杂的多样性的统一体中，成为众人均可接受的形式。有的学者可能会认为纯粹的共同体只存在和谐，不存在任何不和谐及相对立的冲突关系。我的观点是，与所有的朝圣行为相适应的社会模式体现了结构和共同体之间的一种相互妥协却也充满活力的关系。,"Thus social and cultural structures are not abolished by communitas and anamnesis, but the sting of their divisiveness is removed so that the fine articulation of their parts in a complex heterogenous unity can be the better appreciated.Some might say that pure communitas knows only harmonies and no disharmonies or conflict; I am suggesting that the social mode appropriate to all pilgrimages represents a mutually energizing compromise between structure and communitas;"
4807,对上述观点需要做出的评论是，即便基督教世界中的朝圣活动范围远比伊斯兰教的朝觐小得多，但是同样可以将人们联系在一起。这种联系尽管十分短暂，但在一定的社会生活层面上，大量的基督教男女信徒们依然通过朝圣被联系在一起。由于封建的地方主义以及乡村政治和经济生活的边缘化，这些人平日难有相互接触的机会。,"One must comment here that even if Christian pilgrimages did not have the immense scope of the hadj, they had similar effects in bonding together, however transiently, at a certain level of social life, large numbers of men and women, who would otherwise have never come into contact, due to feudal localism and rural decentralization of economic and political life."
4807,事实上，包括西班牙北部孔波斯特拉在内的主要圣地每年都会吸引大量欧洲各国的信徒前往朝圣。,"Indeed, some of the major pilgrimage centers, such as Compostella near the northwest corner of Spain, attracted huge crowds of pilgrims from every country in Europe."
4808,"通过界定这四种成分，我们就能定义什么是 "" uncle"" 。","By specifying each of these four components, we define what it means to be an uncle."
4808,"但除了这种语义，有时我们还需 考虑 "" uncle"" 一词的隐含意义，比如“ 伯父般的"" ( avun cular) 的行为，等等。","Yet in addition to such signification, it is sometimes useful to consider the connotations (connotata) of being an uncle, for example, the characteristic features of ‘avuncular’ behaviour, whatever that might be in particular."
4808,这虽与成分分析的恰当性无关，但在亲属术语中确实有这种隐含意义。,"These are not part of the componential analysis proper, but they do hint at its limitations."
4809,"人类学理论究竟是对事件的顺序、时间框架的更替、多种观念的体系、一套平行共存的国家传统的最贴切的理解，还是一种“程式跳转"" (agenda hopping)的过程，将是这章结尾部分探讨的主题。","Whether anthropological theory is best understood as a sequence of events, a succession of time frames, a system of ideas, a set of parallel national traditions, or a process of ‘agenda hopping’ is the subject of the last section of this chapter."
4809,在某种程度上，这个问题指引着我贯彻本书始终的研究。,"In a sense, this question guides my approach through the whole of the book."
4809,但是，首先让我们看看普遍意义上的人类学的性质，看看一些界定人类学的术语的意义。,But Wrst let us consider the nature of anthropology in general and the meaning of some of the terms which define it.
4810,灵长目动物齿系的演化一般已趋于经济，用较少、较小的牙齿做较多的工作（参见图3.1）。,"The evolutionary trend for primate dentition generally has been toward economy, with fewer smaller teeth doing more work (Figure 3.1)."
4810,在早期阶段，上颌和下颌的每一边各有一颗门齿消失了，使得灵长类动物与其他哺乳动物进一步分化。,"In the early stages, one incisor on each side of the upper and lower jaws was lost, further differentiating primates from other mammals."
4810,人多数灵长目动物的犬齿长得较长，形成匕舒形的牙齿，使它们能够咬碎果实和其他食物的坚硬外壳。,"The canines of most of the primates grew longer, forming daggerlike teeth that enabled them to rip open tough husks of fruit and other foods."
4810,经过几千年的演化，第一颗和第二颗前臼齿变得越来越小，直至最后消失；而第三颗和第四颗前臼齿却越长越大，而且增加了第二尖突或齿尖，因此变成“双尖”齿。,"Over the millennia, the first and second premolars became smaller and eventually disappeared altogether; the third and fourth premolars grew larger and added a second pointed projection, or cusp, thus becoming bicuspid."
4811,1960年代早期，沿海的萨米人在文化上属于劣等群体，也就是说他们被优势的挪威人所看不起。,"In the early 1960s the coastal Sami were a culturally stigmatised group, meaning that they were looked down upon by the dominant Norwegians."
4811,因为这个原因，他们在公共背景下会掩饰他们的种族身份，如在商店里、本地的轮船上，等等。,"For this reason, they undercommunicated their ethnic identity in public contexts, in the shop, on the local steamer and so on."
4811,然后他们假装自己是挪威人，并过度传达他们眼中的挪威人的文化以逃避耻辱。,"They then presented themselves as Norwegians, and overcommunicate what they saw as Norwegian culture to escape from the stigma."
4812,从某种程度上说，每一天都是一样的，每一天都是前一天的放大或者重复。,"Every day is, in a sense, the same day, writ large or repeated."
4812,但是，隐修或中介生活也可能包含着一段伊利亚德所说的“充满奇迹的时光”——带着面具、象征着神灵、祖先、冥王的各种人物会以不同的面目出现在仪式的主体面前，他们或者稀奇古怪，或者面目狰狞，抑或美丽潇洒。,"Then again, seclusion and liminality may contain what Eliade calls ""a time of marvels.""Masked figures, representing gods, ancestors, or chthonic powers may appear to the novices or neophytes in grotesque, monstrous, or beautiful forms."
4812,虽然并不绝对，但通常情况下仪式的主体需要背诵神话传说，以便记住这些居于中介地带的诸位古怪神灵从何而来以及 他们的丰功伟绩。,"Often, but not always, myths are recited explaining the origin, attributes, and behavior of these strange and sacred habitants of liminality."
4812,除此之外，仪式的主持者还可能要向参与者展示圣物，这些圣物可能就是非常一般的物品，比如骨头、陀螺、球、铃鼓、苹果、镜子、扇子以及雅典神话中类似于依洛西斯（Eleusis）神秘仪式中使用的羊毛皮等等。,"Again, sacred objects may be shown to the novices.These may be quite simple in form like the bone, top, ball, tambourine, apples, mirror, fan, and woolly fleece displayed in the lesser Eleusinian mysteries of Athens."
4813,像次级氏族一样，氏族也是引人注目的公共活动场所。氏族拥有最重要的舞蹈场地和祖先崇拜堂。,"Like the subdan, the clan is an arena for dramatic public activities,The clan owns a main dance ground and an ancestral cult house."
4813,"在这些庆典中心,举行公众集会，强调群体统一，以对抗其他氏族。","At these ceremonial centers, public gatherings take place that emphasize the unity of the group as against other dans."
4813,"萨克谢维斯基……把这看作是一项基本策略,用来克服恩加人家庭的强烈独立性，在家里“每个人自己作决策”。","Sackschewsky ... sees this as an essential tactic to overcome the fierce independence of Enga households, where ""each man makes his own decisions""."
4813,这种家庭独立性给头人造成难题，头人促进家庭之间的统一，在竞争激烈和危险的社会环境中，致力于增强氏族的力量。,"Such familistic independence creates problems for Big Men, who encourage interfemily unity in the effort to enhance the strength of their own dans in a fiercely competitive and dangerous social environment."
4814,对于实验者或调查分析员来说，抽样是一个关键技术。,"For the experimenter or the survey analyst, sampling is a key technique."
4814,所谓抽样，就是选择大量相互平等但又相互独立的单位。,To sample is to select a large number of equal but independent units.
4814,假定一个调查员调查了一个300人的样本是否会投民主党或共和党的票。,Say that a surveyor asks a sample of persons if they will vote Democratic or Republican.
4814,然后，他就可以从这300人的样本中推论出镇、乡、州或国家所有人在投票上的大致看法。,"He then generalizes from this sample of to the total population of the town, country, state, or nation."
4814,这正是民意测验得以完成的方式，就像在对投票结果的预测中经常会出现的那样。,"This is the way polling is done, as in predictions of election results."
4815,非洲卡拉哈里沙漠中的朱瓦西布须曼人的出神之舞就是一例。,One example of this is afforded by the trance dances of the Juhoansi Bushmen of Africa Kalahari Desert.
4815,在这些人当中，在任何一个群体中平均约有一半的男人和三分之一的年长妇女是萨满。,"Among these people shamans constitute, on average, about half the men and a third of the older women in any group."
4815,他们进入出神状态最常见的原因是为了祈雨、控制动物以及——就像在下面这个例子中一样——为了治病(这永远是萨满的一项重要活动，不论他们来自哪里）。,"The most common reasons for their going into trance are to bring rain, control animals, and—as in the present example—to heal the sick (always an important activity of shamans, wherever they are found)."
4816,异例就像特纳的仪式过程模型中的阈限阶段一样，既在外面，又在里面，它对确立的秩序是一种威胁。,"The anomaly, like the liminal phase in Turner's model of the ritual process (Chapter 9), is both outside and inside; it threatens the established order."
4816,有一些规则是针对这些异类动物的：只能在特定的场合下吃它们，女人不能触摸它们，诸如此类。,"Anomalous animals are subject to certain rules; one can only eat them under specific circumstances, women are not allowed to touch them, and so on."
4816,厘哩人最重要的异类动物是穿山甲（Manis tricuspis），根据厘哩人的解释，穿山甲有鱼的尾巴和身体，并且全身覆盖了鱗片，但是它繁殖后代的方式又和哺乳动物一样，它有四条腿，并且还会爬树（Douglas 1975，p.33）。,"The most important anomalous creature among the Lele is the pangolin (Manis tricuspis).It has, the Lele explain, the tail and body of a fish and it is covered with scales, but it gives birth like a mammal.It has four small legs and climbs trees (Douglas 1975, p. 33)."
4816,事实证明，这种动物在厘哩人的神话和仪式生活中有着重要的位置，有一种生殖崇拜的仪式就是以它为中心。,"This animal, it turns out, has an important place in the mythology and ritual life of the Lele.There is a cult of fertility centred on it."
4816,道格拉斯认为，其原因在于，穿山甲以一种重要的方式成为了异类：在其他那些不同之处以外，它每次只生育一个后代。,"The reason, argues Douglas, is that the pangolin is anomalous in a crucial way: in addition to everything else, it gives birth to only one offspring at a time."
4816,从这个角度看，它比其他动物更像人。,In this regard it resembles a human more than an animal.
4817,1920年代正是博厄斯的第二代弟子成长起来的时期，传播论和罗列特质的历史主义这时都已经成为了陈词滥调。,It was during the 1920s that the second generation of Boas's students came of age.
4817,由于受到精神分析法和格式塔心理学的影响，心理学/整合心理学这一支成为了博厄斯学派中的主流。,"Diffusionism and trait-list historicism were becoming old hat, and the psychological/integrationist thread in Boas came into prominence, influenced now by psychoanalysis and Gestalt psychology."
4817,那些遵循博厄斯这一支系的人们重新塑造了这一理论，他们在一起组成了所谓的文化与人格学派，其中包括了本尼迪克特、米德、欧文˙哈洛韦尔（Irving Hallowell)(斯佩克的学生）以及克莱德˙克拉克洪（Clyde Kluckhohn)。,"Those who followed this Boasian strand, reshaping it as they went along into what became known as the culture-and-personality school, included Benedict, Mead, Irving Hallowell (a student of Speck), and Clyde Kluckhohn."
4817,来自哈佛阵营的拉尔夫˙林顿（Ralph Linton)也加入到这一传统中，并将其与来自英国社会人类学的影响相融合。,"Ralph Linton, from the Harvard line, joined in this tradition, which he merged with an influence from British social anthropology."
4818,进化论是一种人类学观点，它强调文化复杂性随着时间发展而增强。,Evolutionism is an anthropological perspective which emphasizes the growing complexity of culture through time.
4818,传播论是一种强调理念从一个地方传播到另一个地方的观点。,Diffusionism is a perspective which emphasizes the transmission of ideas from one place to another.
4818,由于这两种理论对同一件事，即文化是如何变迁的，提出了不同的解释，它们彼此互相对抗。,They compete because they offer different explanations of the same thing: how cultures change.
4818,然而，这二者其实都是一个重大理论 社会变迁理论的一部分。,Yet both are really part of the same grand theory: the theory of social change.
4819,一方面，这种深刻的个人记忆的汇集被整合为一段“生命史”或“生命周期”，以适于科学的典型化。,"On one side, this intensely personal collection of memories is made suitable for scientific typification as a ""life-history"" or ""life cycle."""
4819,"另一方面,尼萨的生活启动了一种有效的、普遍的机制，以在西方产生意义——一个有代表性的、连贯的自我（或者更准确地说，一个在自传中丰满起来的自我）。","On the other, Nisa's life brings into play a potent and pervasive mechanism for the production of meaning in the West—the exemplary, coherent self (or rather, the self pulling itself together in autobiography)."
4819,关于传记和自传的虚构过程没有任何普遍的或本质的东西（Gusdorf 1956；Olney 1972；Lejeune 1975）。,There is nothing universal or natural about the fictional processes of biography and autobiography (Gusdorf 1956; Olney 1972; Lejeune 1975)- Living does not easily organize itself into a continuous narrative.
4819,生活不会轻易地把自已组织成一种连续的叙亊，当尼萨说，她经常这样说，我们住在那个地方，吃东西。然后我们离开，到别的地方去”或者只是“我们过了一天又一天”（第69页）时，我们可以听到不被注意的嗡嗡声、非个人的存在。,"When Nisa says, as she often does, ""We lived in that place, eating things. Then we left and went somewhere else,"" or simply, ""we lived and lived"" (69), the h um of unmarked, impersonal existence can be heard."
4819,从如此模瑚不清的背景中，一个叙事的轮廓在与自己、同吋与另一个人交谈时显现了。,"From this blurred background, a narrative shape emerges in the occasion of speaking, simultaneously to oneself and another."
4819,尼萨讲述她的生活，这一过程在肖斯塔克的书中从文本上被戏剧化了。,"Nisa tells her life, a process textually dramatized in Shostak's book."
4820,社会工作者和传教士在走出去做好事、给予帮助，以及可能的宗教救赎上与医师非常相似。,"The social worker and the missionary resemble the physician in that they are out to do good, to give aid, and perhaps ultimately religious salvation."
4820,社会工作者经常被限制在他们的办公室。,Social workers are normally more confined to their offices.
4820,传教士则会进入田野领域很长时间，并且会比我们能想到的任何其他类型的人们作出更多自我牺牲；实际上，许多最好的民族志一直都是由传教士完成的。,"Missionaries move into the midst of the field for longer periods and with more complete commitment of self than any other people of the types we have considered; in fact, much of the best ethnography has been done by missionaries."
4821,在整个人类历史中，人们一直都要了解：他们是谁，他们从哪里来，为什么他们如此这般行为。,"Throughout human history, people have needed to know who they are, where they came from, and why they behave as they do."
4821,从传统看，神话和传说提供了关于这些问题的答案。,"Traditionally, myths and legends provided the answers to these questions."
4821,自人类学产生以来的200多年里，它提供了回答人们关于自身问题的另一种研究方式。,"Anthropology, as it has emerged over the past 200 years, offers another approach to answering the questions people ask about themselves."
4821,人类学是对人类的研究。,Anthropology is the study of humankind.
4821,人类学家运用科学的研究方式，试图对人类的差异和所有人类共有的那些事情提出合情合理的、客观的理解。,"In employing a scientific approach, anthropologists seek to produce a reasonably objective understanding of both human diversity and aspects all humans have in common."
4821,人类学的两个主要分支学科是体质人类学和文化人类学。,The two major branches of anthropology are physical and cultural anthropology.Physical anthropology focuses on humans as biological organisms.
4822,通过民族主义而表达的传统主义因而具有深刻的现代特征。,The traditionalism which is expressed through nationalism is thus deeply modern in character.
4822,民族主义者声称维京人（Vikings)是挪威人的事实并不意味着民族主义者也是维京人。,The fact that the nationalists claim the Vikings were Norwegians does not mean that the nationalists are Vikings.
4822,我们现在需要更加深入地考察民族主义和现代性之间的关系，这与前面对社会规模、科技和社会整合的不同形式的讨论有着密切的关系。,"We now need to examine more closely the relationship between nationalism and modernity, which has a strong bearing on earlier discussions of social scale, technology and forms of social integration."
4823,另一方面，很明显，特罗布里恩德的文化遭遇了殖民以后，远非毫无变化。,"On the other hand, it is clear that Trobriand culture is far from unchanged after its colonial encounter."
4823,对现代化的一种不同类型的反应以美拉尼西亚和波利尼西亚的所谓船货崇拜为代表（Worsley 1968）。,A different kind of reaction to modernisation is represented in the so-called cargo cults of Melanesia and Polynesia (Worsley 1968).
4823,这些千禧年的政治或宗教崇拜最初出现于第一次世界大战之后，作为与外界越来越多的交往的一种后果，而其中有些崇拜是最新出现的。,"These millenary political or religious cults first emerged as a result of increased contact with the outside world after the First World War, and some are much more recent."
4823,他们具有双重目的：重建传统权威，并获得对外来者（大多数是美国人）的巨大财富的控制权。,They have a double aim: to re-establish traditional authority and to achieve control of the immense wealth of the foreigners (mostly Americans).
4824,规范的存在并不意味着任何社会的所有人都完全赞同或遵从它们。,The existence of norms does not imply that there is total agreement on them or total obeisance towards them in any society.
4824,"例如，很多地方可能都有一条婚后住在男方家里的规则（新婚夫妇应该搬到男方家里居住,参见第八章），但却未必被所有社会成员所遵守。所有规范共有的一点是，它们都与约束力相关。","For instance, there may very well be a rule about virilocality (that a newly wed couple should move in with the groom’s family; see Chapter 8) without it being followed by all members of society.All norms have in common that they are connected with sanctions."
4824,原则上存在积极约束和消极约束。,"In principle, both positive and negative sanctions exist."
4824,积极约束包括对遵守规范的奖赏，而消极约束则带来对违背规则的惩罚。,"A positive sanction involves a reward for following the norms, while a negative one entails punishment for breaching the rules."
4824,不过，“约束力”这个术语通常用来描述消极约束——轻微和严重的惩罚形式。,"However, the term ""sanction"" is usually used about negative sanctions – mild and severe forms of punishment."
4825,从舅居(avunculocal residence)是指一对已婚夫妇和新郎的舅舅生活在-起（参见图9.3)。支持从舅居的因素与促成从父居的因素一样，但是它只发生在女性继嗣对于重要权利和财产的转移至关重要的社会中。,"Avunculocal residence, in which a married couple goes to live with the groom's mother's brother (Figure 9.3) is favored by the same factors that promote patrilocal residence, but only in societies where descent through women is deemed crucial for the transmission of important rights and property."
4825,"特罗布里恩德群岛的居民就是采取这种居处模式,在那里，每一个个体生来就是一个亲属群体的成员，这些亲属通过他们的母亲，他们母亲的母亲，以此类推，直到最初那个衍生广所有后代的女性，来追溯他们的祖先。","Such is the case among the people of the Trobriand Islands, where each individual is a member from birth of a group of relatives who trace their descent back through their mother, their mother's mother，and so on to the one woman all others are descended from."
4826,如果生态环境使女性在维持生计中占主导地位的作用。那么，从母居（matrilocal residence)，即男丁离开他在其中长大的家庭，到他妻子父母家去居住，就是一种可能的结果。,"Matrilocal residence, where the man leaves the family he grew up with to go live with his wife in her parents' household, is a likely result if ecological circumstances make the women's role predominant in subsistence."
4826,这种居处模式在园艺农业社会中最常见，那里的政治组织相对来说比较松散，而妇女之间的合作很重要。,"It is found most often in horticultural societies, where political organization is relatively uncentralized and where cooperation among women is important."
4826,霍皮印第安人提供了一个实例，尽管从事农耕的是男子，但控制土地使用权和收获物的却是妇女。,"The Hopi Indians provide one example; although the men do the farming, the women control access to land and ""own"" the harvest."
4826,而且，甚至不允许男子进入谷仓。,Indeed，men are not even allowed in the granaries.
4827,在这方面，社会与政治革命问题是一个极好的、反复出现的車例。,"The question of social and political revolutions is an excellent, perennial case in point."
4827,对于民族志作者来说，这在很大程度要依靠幸运和机缘——民族志作者身处何时何地，从而与这事件发生关联。,"For the ethnographer, much depends on serendipity and opportunity — where and when the ethnographer was situated in relation to the event."
4827,关注重大革命事件的民族志通常采取的做法是在村落研究的形式下，叙述革命对日常生活造成的影响。,Ethnography that has concerned itself with great revolutions has usually been situated to recount the effects of revolution on everyday life in the form of village studies.
4827,在我看来，村落层次上的民族志中最生动地记录了后革命状态的是威廉˙欣顿的《翻身1966》，它生动深刻地记述了一种革命的社会理论是如何被运用于对一个地方村落社会进行阶级重划与社会重塑的。,"For me, the most vivid village-level ethnography registering post-revolutionary conditions is William Hinton's Fanshen (1966), with its striking account of how a revolutionary social theory is applied in the reclassification and reshaping of local village society."
4828,我们可以描述某一特定文化模式的标志——例如，将人们匆匆忙忙或悠闲自在作为其时间观念的标志——但是，文化是我们基于这样的标志作出的一种抽象的东西。,"We can describe indications of a certain cultural pattern – people hurrying or loitering as clues to their assumptions about time, for example – but culture itself is an abstraction that we make based on such indications."
4828,抽象并没有错，只要我们认可它代表的是什么。,There is nothing wrong with an abstraction so long as we recognize it for what it is.
4828,然而，我们不可避免地会受到诱惑将抽象的东西视作具体的事物。,But inevitably we are tempted to treat the abstraction as a thing.
4828,"这正是怀特海（Alfred North Whitehead) 所称的“错置具体感的谬误”(fallacy of misplaced concreteness), 即错把抽象的东西当成具体的东西。","This is what Alfred North Whitehead called the ""fallacy of misplaced concreteness"", that is, to mistake an abstraction for a concrete thing."
4829,当前的人类学和所有其他人文科的“高”(high)理论话语-一能权威性地统合本领域的思想主体一一还处于一片混乱。,"In anthropology and all other human sciences at the moment, ""high"" theoretical discourse—the body o f ideas that authoritatively unify a field—is in disarray."
4829,目前最有意思、最有激发力的理论著作正是那些指向实践的作品[参见奥特纳的论述（Ortner，1984)]，即对经典问题进行自下而上的再阐述，面这取决于以往髙理论中那些被想当然地接受的事实将如何被重新表述。,"The most interesting a n d provocative theoretical works now are precisely those that point to practice (see Ortner 1984), that is, to a bottom - up reformulation of classic questions, which hinges on how the previously taken-for-granted facts of high theory are to be represented."
4829,这些作品构成了对实证主义视角的新一轮攻击，它们装备上了战后大陆哲学中的解释学、现象学和符 号学等诸般手段，并终于开始对英美的社会理论产生冲击。,"2 These works constitute renewed assaults on positivist perspectives, rearmed by the postwar hermeneutic, phenomenological, and semiotic fashions in Continental philosophy that are finally having an impact on Anglo-American social thought."
4830,例如，在苏格兰的学校中，人们承认苏格兰英语是一种有效的和受尊重的说话方式，并被用来教授标准英语。,"In Scotland, for example, Scots English is recognized in the schools as a valid and valued way of speaking, and it is used in teaching Standard English."
4830,因此，个人就逐渐擅长于在两种方言间来回转换，视他在什么情境中讲话而定。,"As a consequence，individuals become skilled at switching back and forth between the two dialects, depending on the situation."
4830,虽然我们没有意识到它，但当我们从正式的谈话向非正式的谈话转换时，根据我们在什么地方以及我们与谁交谈，我们也在做同样的事情。,"Without being conscious of it, we all do something similar when we switch from formality to informality in our speech, depending upon where we are and whom we are talking to."
4830,"根据情境要求从一种语言层面向另一种语言层面的转变过程，无论是从一种语言向另一种语言，还是从一种方言向另一种方言的转变过程, 都被称为代码转换(code switching)，而且这已成为一些社会语言学研究的主题。","The process of changing from one level of language to another as the situation demands, whether from one language to another or from one dialect of a language to another, is known as code switching, and it has been the subject of a number of sociolinguistic studies."
4831,单系继嗣(unilineal descent，有时也叫单边继嗣）只通过男子一系或者只通过女子一系来确立继嗣群体的成员资格。,"Unilineal descent (sometimes called unilateral descent) establishes descent group membership exclusively through the male or the female line.In non-Western societies, unilineal descent groups are quite common."
4831,在非两方社会，单系继嗣群体相当普遍。,"In non-Western societies, unilineal descent groups are quite common."
4831,个体一出生就归属于一个特定的继嗣群体，该群体根据不同的文化或者通过母系继嗣（matrilineal descent)经由女子一系，或者通过父系继嗣（patrilineal descent)——经由男子一系向上溯源。,"The individual is assigned at birth to membership in a specific descent group, which may be traced either by matrilineal descent, through the female line, or by patrilineal descent, through the male line, depending on the society."
4831,在父系社会中，男性远比女性重要，因为他们被认为要对群体的延续负责。,"In patrilineal societies the males are far more important than the females, for they are considered responsible for the group's perpetuation."
4831,在母系社会中，这一责任落在群体的女性成员身上，她们的重要地位因而得以强化。,"In matrilineal societies, this responsibility falls on the female group members, whose importance is thereby enhanced."
4832,德˙塞尔托注意到，文学语的虚构在科学上被谴责（而在美学上被欣赏），是由于其缺乏“单义性”一一据说自然科学和标准的历史叙述都是绝不模棱两可的。,"De Certeau notes that the fictions of literary language were scientifically condemned (and esthetically appreciated) for lacking ""univocity,"" the purportedly unambiguous accounting of natural science and professional history."
4832,按照这一公式，文学与虚构的话语与生俱来是不稳定的；它“在意义的分层上大做文章；它意在言外；它以那样一种语言描绘自己，从中它不断取得的效果就是其意义不可能被框定或控制”（de Certeau 1983:128）。,"In this schema, the discourse of literature and fiction is inherently unstable; it ""plays on the stratification of meaning; it narrates one thing in order to tell something else; it delineates itself in a language from which it continuously draws effects of meaning that cannot be circumscribed or checked"" (1983: 128)."
4832,这一话语不可救药地是比喻性的和多义的，它不断地被从科学中驱逐出去，但并非总是很成功。,"This discourse, repeatedly banished from science, but with uneven success, is incurably figurative and polysemous."
4832,（只要它的效果开始过于公开地被感觉到，一个科学文本就显得太“文学”了，比如说似乎用了太多的隐喻，似乎依赖风格和形象描绘，等等。）,"(Whenever its effects begin to be felt too openly, a scientific text will appear ""literary""; it will seem to be using too many metaphors, to be relying on style, evocation, and so on.)"
4833,调适一词也指有机体在其环境中造成的变化与环境在有机体中造成的变化之间的相互作用过程。,The term adaptation also refers to the interaction process between changes an organism makes in its environment and changes the environment makes in the organism.
4833,"镰状细胞性贫血基因的传播是一个恰当的例子：很久以前，在中非热带地区，在人类种群中出现了基因突变,在低氧压力的情况下，引起具有镰状红血细胞的生成。","The spread of the gene for sickle-cell anemia is a case in point.Long ago, in the tropics of central Africa, a genetic mutation appeared in human populations, causing the manufacture of red blood cells that take on a sickle shape under conditions of low oxygen pressure."
4833,因为从每一父母经遗传而带有这种特质基因的人通常发生严重的贫血症，并在童年时代死去，所以对抗这种基因传播的选择压力在地方人群中发挥作用。,"Since persons who receive a gene for this trait from each parent usually develop severe anemia and die in childhood, selective pressure was exerted against the spread of this gene in the local gene pool."
4833,后来，新的文化实践——刀耕火种的园艺——被引进到这一地区，通过刀耕火种，因自然植被的消除而造成自然环境的变化。,"Then slash-and-burn horticulture was introduced into this region, creating a change in the natural environment by removal—through cutting (slashing) and burning—of the natural vegetative cover."
4833,这有利于蚊子的繁殖，这种蚊子会携带引起严重疟疾的寄生虫。,This was conducive to the breeding of mosquitos that carry the parasite causing falciparum malaria.
4833,当寄生虫传染给人时，它们就生长在红血细胞内，并引起总是使人衰弱而且经常致命的疾病。,
4834,同时，这种程度的个人投入会具有重要的道德暗示，友谊和其他私密关系会发展到“真”或“假”的田地吗？面对受访者，民族志学者有什么样的道德义务？,"At the same time, this degree of personal involvement has important ethical implications.Are friendships and other confidential relationships developed in the field ""real"" or ""fake""; what are the moral obligations of the ethnographer vis-à-vis the informants?"
4834,当地受访者可能不支持把他们的个人关注点“人类学化”，也不愿意他们的“外国好朋友”突然消失，再也不回来，为了保护受访者，AAA（美国人类学学会）和其他职业团体，以及一些大学院系已经制定了相关道德章程。,"The AAA (American Anthropological Association) and other professional bodies, as well as many university departments, have developed ethics codes for the protection of informants, who may both disapprove of the ""anthropologification"" of their personal concerns and of their ""close friends from abroad"" who suddenly vanish, never to return."
4834,另一些不同的问题与个人的背景经历所造成的职业偏见有关，这些个人经历可能使民族志学者只能看到一部分社会事实，即在他们的早期经验看来有意义的那部分事实。,"A different set of problems concerns professional bias caused by personal biography, which may lead ethnographers to see only those parts of social reality that make sense in terms of their earlier experiences."
4834,另一方面，民族志学者自己已有的相关研究也会提高田野工作的质量（参见Okely and Calloway 1992）。,"On the other hand, existential involvement in one's own research can also improve the quality of the work (see Okely and Calloway 1992)."
4835,也就是说，他们在寻求能够把“公共”纳入到女性内在的事务中，例如养育孩子，以及所有其他的我们每天都会碰见并关注的责任。,In other words they are trying to find ways in which 'the public' can responsibly include the female domestic matters of child-rearing and all the other normal concerns and responsibilities with which we are daily and intimately most concerned.
4835,这些作者假定这些“内在”的事务，以及对关心和信任的需要，主要与性别有关，只是女性的兴趣。,"These writers assume 'the domestic', and the concern for care and trust, to be largely a matter of gender, of interest to females but not males."
4835,对这些人来说，不同性別具有不同的道德视野：男人倾向于在责任、契约和公正中定义道德，女人则更多的是关注与养育孩子相关的道德，例如爱、关心、信任和合作。,"For them, the genders have different moral outlooks: while men tend to phrase morality in terms of obligation, contract and justice, women are most concerned with a morality relevant to the bringing up of children, engendering of love, care, trust and cooperation."
4836,根据其他地方采取的行动者视角和系统视角之间的区别，应该注意到，博安南对提夫社会的变化的分析代表了一种典型的系统视角。,"In accordance with the distinction between actor perspectives and systemic perspectives employed elsewhere, it should be noted that Bohannan's analysis of change in Tiv society represents a typical systemic perspective."
4836,在他的分析中，变化是由外因（外部因素）对整个系统的调整而引起的。,"Change, in his analysis, is caused by exogenous factors (outside factors) modifying the system as a whole."
4836,在另一个以行动者定位的分析中，巴思（Barth 1967）研究了另一个非洲社会（苏丹西部的福尔人）经济领域的衰退，他却强调变化的内部因素。,"In an actor-oriented analysis of the breakdown of economic spheres in another African society, the Fur in western Sudan, Barth (1967) instead emphasises endogenous factors of change."
4836,他展示了一个富有进取心的个人（企业家）如何发现有利可图的、通过不同领域之间的转换，来交换商品的新方式，而结果大致与提夫社会相同：道德经济的崩溃，以及基于供需关系的货币交换的市场原则的普遍化。,"He shows how an enterprising individual (an entrepreneur) discovers new, profitable ways of exchanging goods through conversion between spheres, and the result is roughly the same as in Tiv society; a breakdown of the moral economy, and the universalisation of the market principles of monetary exchange based on supply and demand."
4836,照常，以行动者为中心的视角和系统的视角都能有助于理解社会进程。,"As usual, both the actor-centred and the systemic perspective can be illuminating in understanding social process."
4837,在这讲中，我认为存在一个与其名字相称的德国启蒙运动。,In this lecture I assume that there was a German Enlightenment worthy of that name.
4837,这不是一个无关轻重的事情，也不是毫无争议的。,This is not an unimportant matter; nor is it uncontested.
4837,许多人类学史研究者倾向于沿用诺贝特˙埃利亚斯（Norbert Elias)的方法，沿着一种完全不同的路线描述欧洲大陆的学术史（1969)。,A number of historians of anthropology prefer to follow Norbert Elias in portraying continental Europe's intellectual history along a different line (1969).
4837,在埃利亚斯看来， 法国不仅是欧洲大陆启蒙运动的主要中心（我也赞成这一立场），而且它同苏格兰一起几乎是这一运动唯一的发生地。,"In Elias's view, France was not only the primary center of the continental European Enlightenment (a position to which I, too, subscribe), but also, together with Scotland, its almost exclusive locus."
4837,这种“唯法独尊”的观点认为，启蒙运动的社会历史维度是同文明的概念连在一起的，这同德语国家中几乎唯一的浪漫主义传统截然对立。,"In that exclusivist perspective, the sociohistorical dimension of the Enlightenment is tied to the concept of civilization, as opposed to the almost exclusively Romantic tradition of culture in the German-speaking countries."
4838,格莱恩˙佩尼（H.Glenn Penny)对那个时代德国人类学博物馆的分析非常精彩（2002)。安德鲁˙齐默曼的书 (Zimmermann 2001)有用也精确，但对弗里茨˙格雷布纳和贝纳德˙安科曼1904年的范式转变持有的观点太过热情。,"H. Glenn Penny's analysis of German anthropology museums in that period is excellent (2002), whereas Andrew Zimmermann's 2001 volume is useful and accurate but gives too enthusiastic a view of Fritz Graebner's and Bernard Ankermann's 1904 paradigm shift (Gräbner 1905; Ankermann 1905)."
4838,对于前纳粹时期的德语区人类学，读者可以参考科克（Kdcke 1979)、布朗德维（Brandewie 1990)以及多斯特尔和金格里奇（Dostal and Gingrich 1996)的论述。,"For anthropology in German of the pre-Nazi period, readers might want to refer to Köcke 1979, Brandewie 1990, and Dostal and Gingrich 1996."
4838,对于纳粹时期，英语中非常少有的几部文献中有一个是多斯特尔的著述（Dostal 1994)。,"For the Nazi period, one of the very few pieces available in English is Dostal 1994."
4838,对于1945以后的发展，英语中没有很好的概论。,There is no good overview in English of post-1945 developments.
4839,来自印度西南部的纳亚尔人组成一个拥有土地的武士等级（不是独立社会）。,"The Nayar constitute a landowning, warrior caste (rather than an independent society) from southwest India."
4839,在他们中间，地产由各种社团掌握，这些社团由根据女性家系联系起来的男亲属组 220成。,"Among them, estates are held by corporations of sorts made up of kinsmen related in the female line."
4839,"这些男亲属都一起住在大家庭里，有一个最高辈分的男子做当家人。过去,男子的军事训练约在7岁就开始了，而且从这时起到他们整个青年成年期，在战争需要的时候，他们就远离家庭。这里值得我们关注的有纳亚尔人的三项事务。","These kinsmen all live together in a large household, with the eldest male serving as manager.Three Nayar transactions are of interest here."
4839,第一项事务是在一个女孩第一次来月经后不久发生的。,The first occurs shortly before a girl undergoes her first menstruation.
4839,这包括这样一个仪式，它使这个姑娘与一个青年男子在临时婚姻中结合在一起。,It involves a ceremony that joins together in a temporary union the girl with a young man.
4839,"这种婚姻,可以有性关系，也可以没有性关系，持续几天后终止。","This union, which may or may not involve sexual relations, lasts for a few days and then breaks up."
4840,现代美国人类学已经成形，一方面是受博厄斯学派及其相对论关注点的驱动，另一方面是感知到在本土文化不幸消失之前进行记录的需要。与此同时，在殖民强国大不列颠的情况却非常不同。,"While modern American anthropology had been shaped, on the one hand by the Boasians and their relativist concerns, and on the other hand by the perceived need to record native cultures before their feared disappearance, the situation in the major colonial power, Great Britain, was very different."
4840,殖民机构和在殖民地工作的人类学家之间存在多大程度的共谋，一直是个引起争论的问题（Goody 1995）。但是帝国主义的事实对于英国人类学家来说，即使是含蓄的，也是一个无可逃避的前提，至少在去殖民地化之前如此。,"The degree of complicity between colonial agencies and anthropologists working in the colonies is debatable (Goody 1995), but the very fact of imperialism was an inescapable, if usually implicit, premise for British anthropology at least until de-colonisation."
4840,被拥戴为现代英国社会人类学奠基人的是波兰移民马林诺夫斯基（1884 —1942）。1914—1918年间，他在特罗布里恩德群岛（Trobriand Islands）花了两年时间进行的田野调査为民族志资料的收集建立了一个标准，至今基本上仍然没有受到挑战。,"The man who is often hailed as the founder of modern British social anthropology was a Polish immigrant, Bronislaw Malinowski (1884–1942), whose two years of fieldwork in the Trobriand Islands (between 1914 and 1918) set a standard for ethnographic data collection that is still largely unchallenged."
4841,任何情况（不论是5分钟的交易，还是持续数世纪的一个社会）下的演员，都要参与一场斗争，即把文化和社会意义强加到混乱的存在上面。,The actors in any situation – whether it be a five minute exchange or a society enduring for centuries – are engaged in a struggle to impose cultural and social meaning on the chaos of existence.
4841,这一斗争不仅为对意义的搜寻所激励，同时也为政治、经济和自然因素所激励，并且文化是追寻的而不是给定的。,"This struggle is motivated not only by the quest for meaning but also by political, economic, and natural forces, and culture is sought rather than simply given."
4841,当然，在不稳定的第三世界的情景中，事情尤其是这样，但即使在一位地方医师舒适的候诊室的背景下，模式也是可见的。,"This is especially the case, of course, in the unstable third world situations where anthropologists have increasingly found themselves since the end of World War II, but the pattern is visible even in the antiseptic, cozy setting of a local physician's waiting room."
4842,如果人性是一个因素，那么在解决问题时，人文科学与我们的努力就是相关的。,"If humanity is a factor, then the human sciences are relevant to our efforts at solving problems."
4842,尽管在这些人文科学中，人类学可能会显得最不相关，因为它处理的是异乎寻常和遥远，而不是在家乡的熟悉和亲近——在后者那里我们的问题可能看起来像是一种谎言。,"Among these human sciences, though, anthropology may appear the least relevant, for it deals with the exotic and faraway, not the familiar and close at home, which is where our problems seem to lie."
4842,不过，这一观点有些短视。,This viewpoint is myopic.
4842,实际上，多数世界都关心世界各地发生的民族冲突。,"In fact, much of world concern is with localized ethnic conflicts all over the world."
4842,然后出现一个第四世界，约有十亿人忍饥挨饿，缺乏卫生保健，并被剥夺最低生存条件——他们是否不是我们的关注焦点？,"Then there is the fourth world, that population of almost a billion humans who are starving, lacking medicalcare, and deprived of the minimal conditions necessary for survival; are they not our concern?"
4843,受伊达尔戈偏爱的“光复”这一术语便回荡着西班牙人推翻摩尔人的统治、光复西班牙那一时代的精神。,"The Conquest negated indigenous society;Independence, in Hegelian terms, was the negation of that negation.The new indigenous revival reversed indigenous subjugation in the Conquest.Hence the term favored by Hidalgo ""Reconquest"" with further echoes from the time of the reconquest of Spain from Moorish domination."
4843,莫尔洛斯替伊达尔戈所领导的革命想出了“受命于美洲光复新政府”这样一种名义。,"Morelos conferred on himself the title ""Commissioned by the Reconquest and New Government of America."""
4843,历史学家阿纳斯塔索˙布斯塔曼特（Anastasio Bustamante）则刻意颠倒了当年科尔特斯及其所率部众的行军路线并以此对这场光复革命加以复制，很多细枝末节的事件都被他——加以使用，如此复制出来的历史也曾流行一时。,"Anastasio Bustamante popularized the idea of a war which replicated in reverse the adventure of Cortes and his companions, even down to the smallest incidents."
4843,这种巧妙的颠倒所产生的历史观点还有很多，在此不一一列举。,Many other instances exist of this precise reversal.
4844,地理学、动物学和植物学都顺理成章地发展为博物学家学术领域内影响普遍的学科传统，并产生了包括进化论在内的一系列划时代的学术成就。,"Geography, zoology, and botany were in due course developed into the generalizing traditions of academic scholarship of the naturalists, and they produced epochal intellectual achievements, such as the theory of evolution."
4844,但类似的发展并没有出现在人文科学中。,Similar developments did not take place in the humanities.
4844,关于在日益扩张的帝国境内及其疆域之外的民族的社会、语言和文化知识甚少得到研究，并且是以较为局限的东方学的模式些出色的研究也没能汇聚成一种能变成人类学的归纳性观点，如E.W.莱恩（E.W. Lane)的《现代埃及礼俗记》（1836)以及备受推崇的芒斯图尔特˙埃尔芬斯通（Mountstuart Elphinstone)的《考布尔王国纪实》 (1839/1972)。,"Scholarship regarding the societies, languages, and cultures of the peoples of the growing empire and beyond its boundaries was pursued sparingly and in the particularizing mode of Orientalism, and outstanding studies such as E. W. Lane's An Account of the Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians (1836) and the honorable Mountstuart Elphinstone's An Account of the Kingdom of Caubul (1839/1972) failed to converge into a generalizing perspective that could become anthropology."
4844,尽管严肃的旅行文学拥有很大的公众市场，但旅行作者们通常在扩展其视野的创作尝试中着眼于历史和地理，而“野蛮人”的生活并没有得到太多严肃的关注。,"While there was a large public market for serious travel literature, travel authors looked to history and geography for their wider perspective, and the lives of ""savages"" did not receive much serious attention."
4845,许多学者（Foreman 1986，Manes l990，Eckersley 1992）都曾经试图在激进环境决定论和动物权利运动之间划分一个界限。,"Several writers (Foreman 1986, Manes 1990, Eckersley 1992) have gone to some lengths to identify a boundary between radical environmentalism and the animal rights movement."
4845,佛曼（Foreman）指出，支持动物权利是关注个体动物的健康，狭义上的“深度生态学”（deep ecology）的基础是尊重“生物群落”；“动物权利运动是怜悯性的，希望消除磨难和痛苦”，而广义上的“深度生态学（Deep Ecology）是纯生态学的，认为物物相依，磨难和痛苦是自然所固有的，死亡不是罪恶”，简而言之，“自然知其道。”（Foreman 1986:2，引自 Manes 1990:146）。,"Foreman pointed out that support for animal rights is concern for the wellbeing of individuals, whereas ""deep ecology"" is based on respect for ""the life community"": ""Animal Rights is compassionate, desiring to eliminate suffering and pain"", while ""Deep Ecology is ecological, recognizing that life depends on life, that some suffering and pain is inherent in nature, that death is not evil"", in short, ""that nature knows best"" (Foreman 1986:21, quoted in Manes 1990:146)."
4846,相比之下，独立训练（Independence training）强调个人的独立性、自力更生和个人成就。一个人成为他自己的自我和能力的拥有者。,"By contrast, independence training emphasizes individual independence, self-reliance, and personal achievement."
4846,它一般与这样一些社会有 关，在这些社会里，核心家庭由丈夫、妻子和他们的后代组成，它们是独立的而不是较大家户群体的一部分。,"It is typically associated with societies whose nuclear families, consisting of a husband, wife, and their offspring, are independent rather than a part of a larger household group."
4846,独立训练是诸如美国那样的丄业社会和后工业社会特具的特点。在那些社会里，自力更生和个人成就，特别就男人而言，是生存的重要特质。,"Independence training is particularly characteristic of industrial societies such as that of the United States, where self-reliance and personal achievement, especially for men, are important traits for survival."
4846,这种模式也包括鼓励和劝阻。,"Again, this pattern of training involves both encouragement and discouragement."
4846,在消极的方面，不太重视长期的口头满足，喂奶与其说是由要求推动的，还不如说是由时间表推动的。,"On the negative side, little emphasis is placed on prolonged oral gratification, and feeding is prompted more by schedule than demand."
4847,科学的理想模式，即倡导符码化的（codified)田野调査方法、专业上的公正客观和系统性的详细描述，似乎对他们产生了深刻的影响。,"The scientific ideal seems to press on them acutely, calling for codified field methodology, professional detachment, a systematic write-up."
4847,异文化中任何有碍于这些工作的因素，既是一个民族志事实，也是民族志研究的障碍。,"Whatever about the other culture impedes these tasks is an ethnographic obstacle, as well as anethnographic fact."
4847,例如两位作者都抱怨不能与被访人进行私人性交谈，好像私人性交谈一旦成为一种实地研究方法，就应该在任何文化背景中都能够实现。,"Both writers complain, for instance, about the impossibility of having private conversations with informants, as if private conversation, once baptized as a field method, ought to be culturally possible everywhere."
4847,随着研究方法日益符码化，“客观性和主观性实践”之间的冲突也就曰渐激烈。,"As methodology gets increasingly codified, the clash between ""objective and subjective practices"" becomes increasingly acute."
4848,传统人类学采用的是“类推”而不是“对话”。,"Instead of dialogics, traditional anthropology has practised ‘analogies’."
4848,传统人类学曾经以一种封闭且预设的方式对待他者，试图通过推理而不是从当地的对话中去理解他者，采用来自它自己的逻辑体系进行外在的推理。,"It has treated others in a closed, presumptive way, attempting to understand them via a priori reasoning; instead of having knowledge emerge from local dialogue, traditional anthropology employed extraneous analogies which derived from its own system of rationality."
4848,然后传统人类学就会以独白方式展示自己的资料，即所谓的客观主义风格。,"It then presented its data in a monologic, so-called objectivist fashion."
4849,与血缘家庭相反，夫妻家庭以丈夫与妻子的婚姻纽带为基础。,"Conjugal, as opposed to consanguine, families are formed on the basis of marital ties between husband and wife."
4849,"夫妻家庭最低限度由已婚的夫妻及其扶养的孩子组成，又被称为核心家庭（nuclear family）；夫妻家庭的其他形式是一夫多妻制家庭和一妻多夫制家庭，这可被设想为有一个共同配偶的梭心家庭的集合。一夫多妻制家庭包括一个丈夫多个妻子,而一妻多夫制家庭则包括一个妻子的多个丈夫。","Minimally, a conjugal family consists of a married couple with their dependent children, otherwise known as the nuclear family; other forms of conjugal families are polygynous and polyandrous families, which may be thought of as aggregates of nuclear families with one spouse in common.A polygynous family includes the multiple wives of a single husband, while a polyandrous family includes the multiple husbands of a single wife."
4849,两种家庭经常列在多配偶制家庭的标题之下。,Both are often lumped together under the heading of polygamous families.
4850,"男女诸神是伟大而遥远的存在，他们通常被视为控制着宇宙。如果一个宗教有多个这样的神的话，就被称为多神教（polytheism）,其中每一位神掌管宇宙的某一特殊部分。","Gods and goddesses are the great and more remote beings.They usually are seen as controlling the universe, or, if several are recognized (known as polytheism), each has charge of a particular part of the universe."
4850,例如，古希腊的男神和女神是这样分工的：宙斯是天神，波塞冬是大海的统治者，哈得斯则是冥界之神和死者的统治者。,"Such was the case of the gods and goddesses of ancient Greece: Zeus was lord of the sky, Poseidon was ruler of the sea, and Hades was lord of the underworld and ruler of the dead.Besides these three brothers were a host of other deities, female as well as male, each similarly concerned with specific aspects of life and the universe."
4851,分类体系不仅根据内容变化，而且根据内容的性质发生变化：从自然物到事物的各种属性（颜色、重量、形状、尺寸和声音）、合成物、提取物。,"Not only may classifications vary according to what content is assigned where, then, but also what kind of content: from physical things, to attributes of things (colour, weight, shape, size, sound), to synthetic things, to abstractions."
4851,分类不仅随着范畴内容的范围变化，而且也与范畴定义的复杂程度有关：从单一或共同的称谓到多样称谓或“家庭形似物”（Wittgenstein 1978)。,"Not only may classifications vary according to the scope of categorial content but also the complexity of the latter's definition: from monothetic or common denominations, to polythetic denominations or ""family resemblances"" (Wittgenstein 1978)."
4851,最终，各个类别将以各种方式与其他类别关联：作为特定分类或等级整体的一部分，也成为类比和隐喻转化的对象（Ellen 1997)。,"Finally, different categories may relate to one another in a variety of ways: as parts of taxonomic or hierarchical wholes certainly, but also as opposites, by analogy or other metaphoric transformation (cf. Ellen 1997)."
4852,城市变迁的众多力量和现代民族国家的普适结构威胁着（如果不是已经控制了）传统的秩序和地方。,"A traditional order and localness threatened (if not already overcome) by the massificating forces of urban change, by the universalistic structures of the modern nation-state."
4852,因此，乡村被认为是组织严密的、平等的，不喜欢炫耀差别并尊重按常规办事的能力。,
4852,,"Hence, the rural village is depicted as close-knit and isolated, egalitarian, shunning ostentatious differentiation and esteeming conventional competencies."
4852,它所体现的文化是自愿共享的、均匀统一的，所形成的社会系统相当于一个环绕的整体，其基础是地位关系、多元角色、密集的互动网络、均衡的社会结构，以及归属感（Frankenbei 1966: 286-99；Harris 1974: 38-9)。,"It is seen as embodying a culture which is consensually shared, homogeneous and uniform, and as engendering a social system which amounts to an encompassing whole and is based on status relations, multiplex roles, dense interactional networks, equilibrial social structures, and ascription (cf. Frankenberg 1966:286–92; Harris 1974:38–9)."
4853,这些尝试中有一些蓬勃发展并且作出了重要的研究，其他的则半途而废。,Some of these efforts flourished and produced significant research; others fell by the wayside.
4853,许多尝试随后被规模更广的多元文化主义（multiculturalism)运动所吸纳。,Many were subsequently absorbed into a broader movement for multiculturalism.
4853,尽管多元文化主义使用人类学的标志性概念，但它通常脱离人类学家而向前发展，而人类学家则批评隐藏其中的本质主义（essentialism)。,"Despite its use of anthropology's signal concept, multiculturalism generally went forward independently of anthropologists, who were critical of the essentialism implicit in it."
4853,多元文化主义运动通常的策源地则是新的文化研究领域。此外，该领域还抢占了人类学对文化概念的所有权，使人类学家们倍感恼怒。,"The new cultural studies, which, much to our annoyance, also preempted anthropology's claim to the culture concept, was its usual home."
4854,按照弗洛伊德的看法，儿子对母亲有情欲(熟悉酿成尝试），造成与父亲的对抗关系弗洛伊德称之为恋母情结。,"According to him, the son desires the mother (familiarity breeds attempt), creating a rivalry with the father.(Freud called this the Oedipus complex.)"
4854,儿子必须压抑这种感情，否则就激起远比他强有力的父亲的愤怒。,"The son must suppress these feelings or earn the wrath of the father, who is far more powerful than he."
4854,同样，女儿迷上父亲，即恋父情结，使她与其母亲处在对抗关系之中。,"Similarly, the attraction of the daughter to the father (the Electra complex) places her in rivalry with her mother."
4855,要理解儿童养育实践对与性别相关的人格发展的重要性，我们可以简略考察一下纳米比亚和博茨瓦纳的卡拉哈里沙漠的原住民朱瓦西（发音为zhutwasi)人的儿童是如何成长的。,"To understand the importance of child-rearing practices in the development of gender-related personality characteristics, we may look briefly at how children grow up among the Juhoansi (pronounced zhutwasi), a people native to the Kalahari Desert of Namibia and Botswana."
4855,朱瓦西人是曾经广泛分布在南非大部分地区被称为布须曼人的几个民族屮的一支。,The Juhoansi are one of a number of people traditionally referred to as Bushmen who once were widespread through much of southern Africa.
4855,最近，人类学家已把这些民族称为桑人，认为布须曼这个词具有侮辱含义。,"In recent times, anthropologists have referred to these people as the San, thinking the word Bushman insulting."
4855,不幸的是，桑人——个纳玛语词汇——有极为鄙视的意思。,"Unfortunately, San, a Nama word, has highly pejorative associations."
4855,而且，人类学家误解了布须曼人这个词的词源，该询源来自荷兰语Bossiesman，意思是“强盗”或“歹徒”这个民族因拒不屈从殖民主义统治而贏得了这一称号，因此，把他们称之为布须曼人，这是对他们长期和勇敢地——如果代价极高的话——抵抗殖民化的尊重。,"Moreover, anthro-pologists misunderstood the derivation of the word Bushman, which comes from the Dutch Bossesw，meaning ""bandit"" or ""outlaw"".This designation the people earned for their refusal to knuckle under to colonial domination, so to refer to them as Bushman honors their long and valiant, if costly, record of resistance to colonialization."
4856,所有变迁的终极来源都是创新，创新是指在一个群体内部得到广泛接受的任何新的做法、工具或原理。,"The ultimate source of all change is innovation: any new practice, tool, or principle that gains widespread acceptance within a group."
4856,我们把那些涉及对一个新原理的偶然发现的活动叫作首次创新（primary innovations），而把那些由对已知原理的有意应用而产生的事物叫作二次创新（secondary innovations）。,Those that involve the chance discovery of a new principle we refer to as primary innovations; those that result from the deliberate applications of known principles are secondary innovations.
4856,后者最接近西方文化关于变迁的模型，即可预测的和既定的，时前者则关涉到某些偶然事件。,"The latter corresponds most closely to Western cultured model of change as predictable and determined, while the former involves accidents of one sort or another."
4857,其次，在这点上，被错误地归类地大量的非工业社会或曰“传统”社会的内部也存在巨大的差异。归属的/获得的区别在政治的比较研究中却是一个重要的区别，假如我们没有从类别上将它与特定的社会类型相联系的话。,"Second, there are also great differences within the vast and inaccurate category of nonindustrial, or ""traditional"", societies in this regard.The ascribed/achieved distinction may nevertheless be an important one in the comparative study of politics, provided we do not link it categorically to specific societal types."
4857,更确切地说，这种二分法是每个政治体系的一个方面。,This dichotomy is rather an aspect of every political system.
4857,我们可能会问，个人的属性在多样的政治体系中有多么重要，并且那些世袭的和遵循归属的方面有多么重要呢？,"How important are personal qualities in various political systems, we may then ask, and how important are those aspects which are hereditary and follow ascription?"
4858,利奇自己对结构主义的研究具有广泛的探索性和热情，且在某些方面非常有力。他把它广泛地应用到社会结构、艺术、建筑、非语 言沟通、辱骂用语、仪式、神话和其他领域。,"Leach's own pursuit of structuralism was widely explorative, intense, and, in certain respects, rigorous, and he applied it widely to social structure, art, architecture, nonverbal communication, terms of abuse, ritual, myth, and other areas."
4858,他的分析使用了少许源自通信工程的逻辑操作，主要涉及了二元对立、倒置和其他变型、对变体和对立的重复的研究以及介于中间地位之物的作用，后者即具有二分法所蕴涵的“被驱除的中间地位”的反常的两可状态的事物 (根据利奇的二分法公式，“P即为非P所不是的东西”）,"His analyses make use of a few logical operations derivable from communication engineering, mainly those involving binary oppositions, inversions and other transformations, the exploration of the redundancies of variations and contradictions, and the effects of mediators, that is, anomalous occupants of the ""excluded middle"" that is implied by a dichotomy (a dichotomy of the type, in Leach's formulation, ""p is what not-p is not"")."
4859,涂尔干—莫斯的传统甚至看上去似乎已经被颠覆。,Even seemingly revolutionary advances were grounded in the Durkheim—Mauss orthodoxy.
4859,列维-斯特劳斯（1969a）认为正是集体的分类体系规约着逻辑上普遍的生活。,"Thus, Lévi-Strauss (1969a) explored the logical—universal life to which he claimed collective systems of classification could be seen to lead."
4859,如果乔姆斯基（Chomsky）所说的是任何语言与发音的底层语法结构都是可以相互转换的话，那么列维-斯特劳斯所定义的比较性的无意识、象征分类的深层结构，虽然目前看上去是源自文化，实则根植于社会化了的个体的思想中。,"If Chomsky could argue for underlying grammatical structures of which every language and every speech-act might be said to be transformations, then Lévi-Strauss determined that comparably unconscious, deep structures of symbolic classification, albeit now culturally derived, inhabited the minds of socialized human individuals."
4859,结构人类学将源自不同文化和时代的分类体系之间繁多的转换与变异的图景看作是相互联系的，其中存在一定转化规则（比如二元对立）。,A structural anthropology might chart the vast network of transformations and variations by which the classificatory systems of different cultures and times were linked and the transformatory principles (such as binary opposition) by which this was effected.
4860,正如我们已经注意到的，社会人类学中，最小的积木不是单个的行动者而是两个行动者之间的关系。,"The smallest building-block in social anthropology is, as already noted, not the isolated actor but a relationship between two actors."
4860,最小的社会系统因此就是这种二元关系。,The smallest social system is thus the dyadic relationship.
4860,世界上很少有这么封闭的系统；而且在这么狭窄的系统框架内，相对来说，也只有很少的社会行动发生。,There are few systems of this modest compass in the world; and there are relatively few social activities which take place within the framework of a system this narrow.
4860,因此，当田野工作者到达一个地方，他或她通常很快就会发现，最小、最容易接近并且发生密集而重要的互动的社会系统是家户。,"When the fieldworker arrives in a locality, therefore, he or she will usually soon find out that the smallest and most easily accessible social system where intensive and important interaction takes place is the household."
4860,在许多个案里，人类学家在田野调査期间，事实上成为了某一家户的客人，再加上家户（尽管它们在成分上有所不同）在每个社会都存在，所以，从探究这个社会系统入手去开展经验研究似乎是合理的。,"In many cases, the anthropologist will actually be a guest in a household during fieldwork.Therefore, and because households (although they differ in their composition) exist in every society, it seems reasonable to begin an empirical study by exploring this social system."
4861,在西方思想中，古希腊人逐渐树立起一种具有深远意义的二元论。,The Greeks instilled a profound dualism in Western thought.
4861,在许多世纪中，心身之分、形式与实质之分，彻底渗入西方思想。,"Distinctions between mind and body, form and substance, thoroughly penetrated Western thinking for centuries."
4861,在这一二元论框架内，罗马人发展出一种“自然”概念，作为一件事情最内在最本质的性质。,"Within this dualistic framework, the Romans developed a notion of ""nature"" as the basic qualities inherent in a thing."
4861,直到“自然”变成一个自我包容的物质世界，这一概念才得到扩展。,"This meaning was extended until ""nature"" became a self-contained material world."
4861,这一准备工作，为我们现代的“自然科学”概念，也为什么是“不自然”（后来命名为“文化”)这一概念打下了基础。,"The ground work was laid for our modern notions of natural science and also for a notion of what is not-nature (later named ""culture"")."
4862,另一类别的发嗓音是由语音修饰（vocal qualifiers）构成的。,Another category of vocalizations consists of vocal qualifiers.
4862,有一种比嗓音特征表露更短暂的音延，一般限于单个语调空隙里，而不是遍及整条短语。,"These are of briefer duration than vocal characterizers, limited generally to the space of a single intonation, rather than over whole phrases.They modify utterances in terms of intensity—loud versus soft; pitch—high versus low; and extent—drawl versus clipping."
4862,它们根据强度音的响亮与柔和、音调的高与低、迟缓与快速来修饰话语这些表示说话人对诸如“滚出去”这类特殊短语的态度。,"These indicate the speaker's attitude toward specific phrases, such as ""Get out!"""
4862,第三类别是由发声间隔（vocal segregates) 构成的。,The third category consists of vocal segregates.
4863,此外，20世纪50年代所听到的“英国结构主义者”这个词，是要将拉德克利夫-布朗的思想同列维-斯特劳斯的思想或称“法国结构主义”区别开（在第八章中叙述）。,"Furthermore, the term ‘British structuralist’ was heard in the 1950s to distinguish Radcliffe-Brownianism from Lévi-Straussianism or ‘French structuralism’ (described in chapter 8)."
4863,令人不解的是，20世纪60年代初，新一代英国人类学家开始转向列维-斯特劳斯，他们给他们自己戴上了“英国结构主义者”的标签。,"Confusingly, when in the early 1960s a new generation of British anthropologists turned to Lévi-Strauss, they assumed the label ‘British structuralist’ for themselves."
4863,从广义上说，后来这个“英国结构主 义”实际上是“法国结构主义”的英国版！,"In broader terms, the latter ‘British structuralism’ was actually a British version of ‘French structuralism’!"
4864,它在理论与实践之间以及教学与研究之间的分离，它所具有的可观的理论连续性，以及它相对来说较晚的学科建制以及田野工作转向都使得法国人类学可以声称自己是一种具有真正独特性的国别化人类学流派。,"In its separation of theory and practice and of teaching and research, and in its considerable theoretical continuities and its relatively late institutionalization and turn to fieldwork, French anthropology can claim true distinction as a national anthropological school."
4864,然而虽然这种独特流派对于更加宽泛的法国学术传统来说也仍然是这样的，但它并不是孤立的。,"Yet although this school has remained true to French intellectual traditions more widely, it has not been isolated."
4864,现代法国社会思想既汲取了自身的理性主义和普遍主义传统，也借鉴了德国诠释学和现象学以及英国的经验主义；它还扩展了自己的海外影响力，不仅是对英国——在那里它或许可以说是主导性的——而且还对美国和德国。,"Modern French social thought has drawn on German hermeneutics and phenomenology and on British empiricism as well as on its own more rationalist and universalist traditions; it has also spread its influence abroad, not only to Britain, where it has perhaps been dominant, but also to America and Germany."
4864,因此，法国被列为当今世界最重要的社会思想和民族志实践生产者之一，实属实至名归。,France therefore fully deserves its status as one of the world's leading producers of social thought and ethnographic practice
4865,在公众心目中，人类学通常等同于找回远古人类祖先的尸骨，发掘古代营地和“消失的城市”，或者研究现代部落民族，他们的生活方式被错误地看成是“来自过去的”某种事情。,"In the public mind, anthropology often is identified with the recovery of the bones of remote human ancestors, the unearthing of ancient campsites and ""lost cities"", or the study of present-day tribal peoples whose way of life is erroneously seen as something ""out of the past."""
4865,人们经常没有注意到的是人类学知识的实际应用。,People often are unaware of the many practical applications of anthropological knowledge.
4865,应用人类学的一个领域被称为法医人类学（Forensic Anthropology）为合法的目的专门从事人的骨骼遗体的辨别。,One field of applied anthropology——known as forensic anthropology——specializes in the identification of human skeletal remains for legal purposes.
4865,法医人类学通常根据警察和其他权成机构的要求辨别凶杀受害者、失踪人员或如飞机坠毁等突难中死亡人员的遗体。,"Forensic anthropologists are routinely called upon by police and other authorities to identify the remains of murder victims, missing persons, of people who have died in disasters such as plane crashes."
4866,"德里达认为把全部文本作为分析单位是荒谬的 （例如 Derrida 1976[1967];1978[1967]), 在这一点上他的思想与结构主义产生分歧。","Derrida (e.g., 1976 [1967]; 1978 [1967]) broke with structuralism in an attempt to expose what he saw as the fallacy of any analysis which accepts the totality of a text as a unit of analysis."
4866,他声称任何文本都离不开矛盾。,"Any text, he argues, will entail contradictions."
4866,索绪尔的“差异”（后索绪尔结构主义者用来说明有区分的特征或二元对抗）观念被转化成一个复杂的概念，其中既有“差异”（来自法语的différence，即“差异”) ，又有“服从”（来自法语的différance [sic]，是德里达为这一现象杜撰的新词）的意思。,"The Saussurian notion of ‘difference’ (referred to by post-Saussurian structuralists in terms of distinctive features or binary oppositions) is transformed into a complex concept where meaning is both ‘different’ (through différence, ‘difference’) and ‘deferred’ (through différance [sic], Derrida’s neologism for this phenomenon)."
4867,这些文章可能会被指责说走得太远了——诗歌将再次在城邦中遭禁，权力也不许踏上科学的殿堂。,"These essays will be accused of having gone too far: poetry will again be banned from the city, power from the halls of science."
4867,极端的自我意识的确有它的危险：精英主义、唯我论，将整个世界打上引号。,"And extreme self-consciousness certainly has its dangers—of irony, of elitism, of solipsism, of putting the whole world in quotation marks."
4867,但我相信读者发出这些危险信号（如本书中一些文章所做的），将是在他们已经与既有再现形式的变化的历史、修辞和政治短兵相接之后。,"But I trust that readers who signal these dangers will do so (like some of the essays below) after they have confronted the changing history, rhetoric, and politics of established representational forms."
4867,在符号学、后结构主义、阐释学和解构的觉醒中，有大量关于回到朴素的言谈和现实主义的议论。,"In the wake of semiotics, post-structuralism, hermeneutics, and deconstruction there has been considerable talk about a return to plain speaking and to realism."
4868,特纳对涂尔干的框架做了一些改动。,Turner rings yet another change on the Durkheimian framework.
4868,涂尔干强调群体生活中已经建立的结构，特纳则强调他所命名的“反结构”。,"Where Durkheim emphasizes the established structures of group life, Turner emphasizes what he terms ""anti-structure."""
4868,例如，反结构在线性状态中可以被找到，在这一状态中，当人们在生命礼仪中经过童年进人成年，新加人的人会暂停下来。,"Anti-structure, for example, is found in the ""liminal"" state in which initiates are suspended as they pass from childhood to adulthood in rites of passage."
4868,新加入的人既不是孩子也不是成人，而是位于这两个确立状态“之间”。,"Initiates are neither child nor adult, they are ""betwixt and between"" these established statuses."
4869,在当今的美国也有一些反文化群体，就像东方的圣人一样，他们也留着长发、蓄着胡须，穿着打扮各式各样，有的像城市里的贫民，有的像农村里地位低下的少数群体——如印第安人和墨西哥人。,"In America today we have the counterculture people, who like holy men of the East wear long hair and beards and dress in a variety of ways ranging from the clothes of the urban poor to the attire of underprivileged rural and ethnic groups, such as Amerindians and Mexicans."
4869,不久之前，一些极具反叛精神的嬉皮士甚至拒绝美国主流的着装方式，在充满竞争的生意场上他们偏偏不去穿那些能体现男子气概和职业进取精神的服装，而是戴着项链、手镯和耳环。20世纪60年代后期他们所倡导的“权力归花儿”。也正是为了反对军事力量和经济发展才提出来的，在这一点上，他们与中世纪时期印度南部的维拉塞瓦（Virasaiva)圣徒们所倡导的原则十分类似。,"So critical were some hippie men, not long ago, of the principles underlying the structure out of which they hadopted that they even rejected in their dress the dominant American stress on virility and successful aggressiveness in a competitive business milieu by wearing beads, bangles, and earrings, just as ""flower power,"" in the late 1960's, was opposed to military strength and business aggressiveness."
4870,博厄斯于1886年在柏林巴斯蒂安那里取得了从业资格后设法赴美国定居。,"After Boas attained his habilitation with Bastian in 1886 in Berlin, he managed to establish himself in the United States."
4870,他带来了巴斯蒂安的反进化论取向和对经验的强调，并带有某种对历史的以及温和的传播论的重视。,"He took with him Bastian's antievolutionist orientation and empirical emphasis, with certain historical and moderate diffusionist priorities."
4870,博厄斯从德国带来的“知识行李”中还有对地方语言、体质人类学和民俗研究的兴趣，以及某种程度上温和形式的民族主义。,"Boas's intellectual luggage from Germany also included interests in local languages, physical anthropology, folklore studies, and, to an extent, moderate forms of nationalism."
4870,在俾斯麦统治下的德国中所崛 起的反自由主义和反犹太主义也是博厄斯更广泛的移民动机中的部分政治因素。,The rise of antiliberalism and anti-Semitism in Bismarck's Germany certainly were part of the political side in Boas's wider motives for emigration.
4870,但作为军刀决斗学生社团的成员，博厄斯移民前对民族主义并不陌生（D.Cole 1999，38—62；Girtler 2001，572)。,"The saber-dueling student fraternity member Boas, however, had himself been no stranger to German nationalism before his emigration (D. Cole 1999, 38–62; Girtler 2001, 572)."
4871,刚才插述的澳大利亚原住民猎人的食物分配习惯是泛化互惠（generalized reciprocity）的一个实例。,
4871,泛化互惠可以被定义为不计算所赠送东西的价值，偿还 时间也不确定的交换。,"This may be given is not calculated, nor is the time of repayment specified."
4871,在不谋私利意义上的礼物赠送也属于这一范畴。,"Gift giving, in the altruistic sense, also falls in this category."
4871,"因此，富有同情心的行为也属此类，例如,某人停下来帮助抛锚的摩托车手或某个处在困境 中的人，拒不接受报酬并劝告说“把它转给下一位需要帮助的人”。","So, too, does the act of a Good Samaritan who stops to help a stranded motorist or someone else in distress and refuses payment with the admonition aPass it on to the next person in need."
4871,然而，泛化互惠大多发生在近亲属之间或者有另外密切关系的人们之间。,"Most generalized reciprocity, though, occurs among close kin or peo­ple who otherwise have very dose ties with one another."
4871,一般说来，参与者会否 认交换是经济交换，并且会明确地根据亲属关系和朋友义务来表述它们。,"Typically, participants will deny that the exchanges are economic and will couch them ex­plicitly in terms of kinship and friendship obligations."
4872,R. R.马雷特将这种关于非人格的力量或潜能的观念称为泛生信仰(animatism)。,R. R. Marett called this concept of impersonal power animatism.
4872,这两个概念——泛生信仰（它是无生命的）和泛灵信仰(对精神存在物的信仰)——并不相互排斥。,"The two concepts, animatism (which is inanimate) and animism (a belief in spirit beings), are not mutually exclusive."
4872,它们常常在同一种文化中被发现，比如在美拉尼西亚和前面提到过的印第安人社会中。,"They often are found in the same culture, as in Melanesia, and also in the Indian societies just mentioned."
4873,人们有三种可能的方式可以提髙他们的地位。,A person has three possible ways of improving his or her situation.
4873,他或她可以试图改变种姓身份（这在一个小村子里是极其困难的），试图提高他或她自己的种姓相对等级，或者抛弃整个种姓制度并试图在外面获得事业。,"He or she may try to change caste membership (which is exceedingly difficult in a small village), try to improve his or her own caste's relative rank, or dismiss the entire caste system and try to make a career outside it."
4873,几十年来，比斯帕拉的制酒者（distiller）已经稳步地提高了他们的经济地位，但这并没有使其仪式化洁净度也获得提高。,"The distiller caste in Bisipara had improved its economic condition steadily for decades, but this did not entail an improvement of its ritual purity."
4873,事实上，人们可以非常富裕但却是肮脏的，反之亦然，尽管富裕程度和仪式化洁净程度往往相互关联。,"One may, in fact, be well-off and ritually polluting and vice versa, although there tends to be a correlation between wealth and ritual purity."
4873,种姓的首领因而努力要将他们的经济资本转化成仪式化洁净度。,The leaders of the caste thus tried to convert their economic capital into ritual purity.
4873,首先他们必须通过被总称为梵语化（sanskritisation）的过程使自己的行为得到净化，他们还要停止举行低级种姓的典型仪式行为（例如动物献祭），同时，在其他方面要采取婆罗门教的规范，成为素食者，等等,"First they had to purify their own practices through what is generally known as Sanskritisation.They ceased to perform typical low-caste rituals (such as animal sacrifice) and adopted Brahmanic rules in other respects as well, becoming vegetarians and so on."
4874,里弗斯和塞利格曼在托雷斯海峡待了几个月后，很明显已被民族志发现活动所带来的兴奋及其多产的潜能所折服。,Rivers and Seligman were clearly smitten with the excitement and productivity of ethnographic discovery after their few months in the Torres Straits.
4874,里弗斯很快就参与到更多的田野作业中。他在1901年来到南印度并在托达人 (Todas)中待了五个月，展开了对这个最迷人、最复杂的、近乎童话般社区的研究。,"Rivers soon left for more fieldwork, this time in South India in 1901, where he spent five months among the Todas and produced a study of a most intriguing, intricate, and almost fairy-tale community."
4874,来自旅行者和探险者的报告已经积累了许多零散的关于托达人奇风异俗的民族志描述，但在里弗斯的手里，托达人变成了一个复杂社区里的成员，拥有独特的生活方式，因此《托达人》 (1906)长期以来都被认为是以新的、集中式田野研究方法论完成的人类学专著的典范。,"Many snippets of strange ethnography had already been accumulated about the Todas from the reports of travelers and adventurers.But in Rivers's hands Todas emerged as members of a complex community with a distinctive way of life, and so The Todas (1906) was long regarded as a model of what an anthropological monograph could be when based on the new, intensive field methodology."
4875,群体间的语音差异同样可以被视为词汇差异。,Phonological differences between groups may be regarded in the same light as vocabulary differences.
4875,例如，在有阶级结构的社会中，上层阶级的成员可能试图保持他们与下层阶级成员不同的发音。,"In a class-structured society, for example, members of the upper class may try to keep their pronunciation distinct from that of lower classes."
4875,缅因州一些海岸社区尤其提供了不同种类的实例，虽然沿新英格兰海岸的其他地方也可能不同程度地看到这些例子。,"An example of a different sort involves coastal communities in Maine, in particular, though it may be seen to varying degrees elsewhere along the New England coast."
4875,过去，在这些社区中的人们逐渐形成一种地区方言，有一种完全不同于“外来人”的发音语调。,"In the past, people in these communities developed a regional dialect with a pronunciation style quire distinct from those of ""inlanders""."
4875,"最近，外来人已迁到这些海岸社区，有的来避暑, 有的永久定居，传统的海岸语调已逐渐认同那些坚持海岸价值的人，与那些不坚持 海岸价值的人形成对立。","More recently, as outsiders have moved into these coastal communities, either as summer people or as permanent residents, the traditional coastal style has come to identify those who adhere to traditional coastal values, as opposed to those who do not."
4876,这种等式包括了社会文化因素，也包括各种环境因素——换句话说，文化和社会不仅是果，也是部分的因。,"This kind of equation includes sociocultural factors as well as environmental ones – in other words, culture and society are not mere effects, but also part of the cause."
4876,人类并不是机械地作用于环境因素，即使这些因素直接或间接地影响了他们的行动。,"Humans do not act mechanically on environmental factors, even if such factors affect their actions directly and indirectly."
4876,一些对放牧者进行研究的人类学家已经设计出正确的公式，可以用来描述既定区域内的动物数目、家户生存能力的极限和可持续的生态之间的精确的相互关系。,"Some anthropologists writing on pastoralists have worked out accurate formulas which describe the exact interrelationship between the number of animals in a given area, viability limits for households and ecological sustainability."
4876,在富拉尼人中（参见第五章），对于一个年轻的家户来说，生存的下限被设定为21头母牛和1头公牛。,"Among the Fulani (see Chapter 5), the lower limit for viability was set at 21 cows and a bull for a young household."
4876,也有上限规定了放牧的规模：既有社会的限制（一个家户顶多只能放养这么多的牲畜）也因为太大规模的放牧会导致牧场土地的退化以及最终导致沙漠化。,There was also an upper limit to the size of herds; both due to social limitations (a household can only herd so many animals) and because too large a herd would lead to the degradation of the grazing land and ultimately lead to desertification.
4877,如果有人能像看动作片一样注意到社会过程并且能够仔细审视“静止”的部分——即一个社区中与社会过程并存的社会关系，那么他可能就会发现这些暂时性的结构既不完整也并非完 美无缺，而是需要不断地进行调整。,"If one were able to arrest the social process as though it were a motion film and were then to examine the ""still,"" the coexisting social relations within a community, one would probably find that the temporary structures were incomplete, open-ended, unconsummated."
4877,此外，这些结构不可避免地会趋于消亡。但如果有人能像科幻小说中描写的那样可以潜人到社会行为者思想的深处，他肯定能发现行为者在其全然的有意识的注意力与无意识的混沌黑暗的深处这二者之间的任何层面上都存在着一系列的观念、意象和概念，我们可以将其称作“非时间性结构”,"They would be, at most, on their way to an endingBut if one had the science-fiction means of penetrating into the minds of the arrested actors, one would undoubtedly find in them, at almost any endopsychical level existing between the full brightness of conscious attention and the darker strata of the unconscious, a set of ideas, images, concepts, and so on, to which one could attach the label ""atemporal structures."""
4878,第一种做法是，通过连续性的叙事和共时的效果，民族志作者可以尝试在一个单一文本中来表现多重的、随机相互依存的场所，对每个场所进行民族志式的探索，而这些场所又通过发生于其中的行动的预期和非预期的结果而相互连接在一起。,"First, by sequential narrative and the effect of simultaneity, the ethnographer might try in a single text to represent multiple, blindly interdependent locales, each explored ethnographically and mutually linked by the intended and unintended consequences of activities within them."
4878,如果这种做法的目的只在于展示现代社会中个人之间的随机相互依存性（由此个人以不可预期的方式与他人联系在一起），那么只要细想下，就会发现这是个荒唐和毫无意义的方案——这就好比要试图说明美国人的心理健康和中国的茶叶价格之间的联系一样。,"If the intent were merely to demonstrate random interdependencies by which everyone is unexpectedly connected to everyone else in the modern world, if only you looked hard enough, this would be an absurd and pointless project — to show, say, the connection between mental health in America and the price of tea in China."
4878,相反，这一方案的要点应该是从某种预设的体系观入手，通过展示此体系所包含的地方生活的各种形态而提供一种关于此体系的民族志记述，用更人性的语言（human terms)来转写其抽象的性质，从而使我们对这一体系自身之本质生发出新颖并有所修正的理解。,"Rather, the point of this kind of project would be to start with some prior view of a system and to provide an ethnographic account of it, by showing the forms of local life that the system encompasses, and then leading to novel or revised views of the nature of the system itself, translating its abstract qualities into more fully human terms."
4879,要他们去追踪这些事情也很难；不过，世界上的许多国家，非正式经济其实比正式经济还要重要。,"It is also difficult for them to track; yet, in many countries of the world, the informal economy is, in fact, more important than the formal economy."
4879,在许多地方，被限制进入正式部门的大量未充分就业和失业的人员，实际尽其最大的努力临时利用各种手段，依靠贫乏的资源 “勉强生活”。,"In many places, large numbers of under- and unemployed peoples who have only limited access to the formal sector in effect improvise as best they can various means of ""getting by"" on scant resources."
4879,同时，社会比较富裕的成员，为了使他们的回报最大化，也逃避各种各样的管理，而且面对日益增加的政府管理，当他们感到自主性丧失时，也发泄其沮丧情绪。,"Meanwhile, more affluent society members may evade various regulations to maximize returns and to vent their frustrations at their perceived loss of self-determination in the face of increasing government regulation."
4880,同一小群具有相同想法的学者一起，泰勒继续为此新学科设计出问题和概念，并在其具有影响力的《原始文化》（1871)中为其提供了一个连贯的表述。,"With a small handful of likeminded scholars, Tylor proceeded to work out the issues and concepts for the new discipline and gave them a coherent formulation in his influential Primitive Culture (1871)."
4880,他明确提出的理论前提-—“人类心智同一性” 极为重要：这一理念巧妙地运用其多义性将人种学者的废奴主义和人道主义信念转变为对全人类平等和其精神价值的承认。,"Of greatest importance was his explicit premise of ""the psychic unity of man""—a felicitously polysemous transformation of the ethnologists' abolitionism and humanitarian commitment to the equality and moral value of all of humankind."
4880,这为人类学引入了一种相对主义，以调和维多利亚时代的民族中心主义。,It introduced into anthropology a relativism with which to temper Victorian ethnocentrism.
4881,分层社会（society）基本上是分成两个或两个以上类别人群的社会、这些类别彼此之间有相对的高低等级之分。,"Basically, a stratified society is one divided into two or more categories of people ranked high and low relative to one another."
4881,当我们把这样一个层次或者阶层的人与另一个层次或阶层的人进行比较的时候，他们在特权、报酬、限制和义务等方面的差别就变得很明显了。,"When the people in one such stratum are compared with those in another, marked differences in privileges, rewards, restrictions, and obligations become apparent."
4881,较低阶层的成员与那些较高阶层的成员相比拥有较少的特权和权力。,Members of low ranked strata tend to have fewer privileges and less power than those in higher ranked strata.
4881,此外，他们一般不会得到同等的报酬，并且没有获得基本资源的平等途径。,"In addition, they tend not to be rewarded to the same degree and are denied equal access to basic resources."
4881,他们的义务和受到的限制通常也更加繁多，尽管较髙阶层的成员也要对付他们自己独特的限制和义务。,"Their restrictions and obligations, too, are usually more onerous, although members of high ranked strata usually have their own distinctive restrictions and obligations to attend to."
4881,总之，社会分层等于制度化的不平等。,"In short, social stratification amounts to institutionalized inequality."
4881,没有等第之别——髙与低——分层就不存在，社会差别没有这一点也不构成分层。,Without ranking—high versus low—no stratification exists; social differences without this do not constitute stratification.
4882,他们被指望耕作祖先的土地，同时也被指望挣钱，后者只能通过移民而实现了。,"They are expected to till the land of their ancestors, but also to earn money, which can only be achieved through migration."
4882,这类社会的内在区别模糊不清，不像前一类型那样具有强烈的“仪式化”的社会关系。,"Internal differentiation is unclear and ambiguous, unlike the strong ""ritualisation"" of social relationships in the previous type."
4882,道格拉斯（Douglas 1970）列举的第三种社会类型被她称为“强栅极”，这一类型的群体内聚力较弱。,"The third societal type exemplified in Douglas (1970) is the kind she calls ""strong grid"", where group cohesion is weak."
4882,她认为，这类社会也许更适合用暂时的关系网而非合作群体来进行描述，没有首领，也没有严格的边界。,"This is a sort of society, she argues, which might be better described in terms of temporary networks than in terms of corporate groups; where there are no chiefs and no rigid boundaries."
4882,不过，她也注意到，社会的意义和分类知识是被共享的。,"Nevertheless, she notes, the meanings and classifications of society are shared."
4883,总之，人类个体是能动的世界参与者。,
4883,实际上，由于他们的能量决定了世界上一定的关系和事物的特征，个体可以说是世界的创造者。被理解为“有序”或“无序”的是指那些被个体当作是正常规范的或是非正常病态的一定事物之间的特定关系；这只是从事物和关系的无数种可能的排列组合中的一部分，对其分类和评价有赖于观察者的眼睛。,"For what could be understood by ‘order’ or ‘disorder’ were certain relationships between certain objects which individuals came to see as normal and normative or as abnormal and pathological; here were some from an infinite number of possible permutations of objects and relations in the world, whose classification and evaluation were dependent on the eye of the perceiver."
4884,新国家中的某些民族对这个国家忠诚度不高，他们往往想脱离它，建立自己的独立国家。,"Distinct peoples within a new state, to which they may feel little allegiance, often seek to secede and set up their own separate state."
4884,但是追溯欧洲的非殖民化进程，就可以看到，只有一部分分离主义运动获得了成功，从而建立起新的国家，新加坡、孟加拉和厄立特里亚就是其代表。,"Following European decolonisation, only a few such secessionist movements have managed to create new states: Singapore, Bangladesh and Eritrea are leading examples."
4884,实际上，分离常常遭到强烈反对。,
4884,,There is a strong presumption against secession.
4885,阿诺尔德·范·根纳普在人类学的一本经典著作中分析了生命礼仪，这种仪式帮助个人度过他们生命中的重要关头，比如出生、青春期、结婚、为人父母、踏入史高阶层、职业专业化以及死亡。,"In one of anthropology's classic works, Arnold Van Gennep analyzed the rites of passage that help individuals through the crucial crises of their lives, such as birth, puberty, marriage, parenthood, advancement to a higher class, occupational specialization, and death."
4885,他发现，将所有谊些为生命关口准备的典礼分三个阶段：分离（separation)、过渡（transition)和融入（incorporation)——是有用的。,"He found it useful to divide ceremonies for all of these life crises into three stages: separation, transition, and incorporation."
4885,个人首先会被仪式性地从社会整体中排除出去，然后隔离上一段时期，最后重新融入社会，获得其新地位。,"The individual first would be ritually removed from the society as a whole, then isolated for a period, and finally incorporated back into society in his or her new status."
4886,欧洲的分离运动可能会破坏欧洲大陆的和平。,"In Europe, fragmentation could undermine the peace of the continent."
4886,苏格兰和威尔士的分离主义最终可能会导致英国的分裂，这将威胁到欧洲的稳定。,Scottish and Welsh separatism may ultimately lead to the break-up of the United Kingdom.This could threaten the stability of Europe.
4886,在欧洲大陆，德国对欧洲的影响将会更大，因为迄今统一的德国以及使用德语的民族的影响力还被其周边的国家平衡着，可以想见，英国的分裂将会加大新德国的相对地位。,"On the Continent, German influence would become preponderant, for until now the weight of a united Germany and of German-speaking peoples was balanced by the states on its periphery.The not inconceivable fragmentation of the United Kingdom would increase the relative weight of the new Germany."
4887,据说，目前有233个不安分的民族和族群正在要求自决。,Two hundred and thirty-three often restive peoples and national communities are said now to be advancing claims for self-determination.
4887,用前联合国秘书长加利的话来说，就是：“如果每一个种族、宗教或语言群体都宣布建立国家，那么分裂会无休无止，全人类的和平、安全和经济繁荣将更加难以实现。”,"In the words of the former UN Secretary General, Boutros Ghali, ‘if every ethnic, religious or linguistic group claimed statehood, there would be no limit to fragmentation, and peace, security and economic well-being for all, would become even more difficult to achieve’."
4888,很多部落社会赋予氏族以政治权威，氏族是一群自认为来自同一祖先的人们的联合体。,"Many tribal societies vest political authority in the clan, an association of people who consider themselves descended from a common ancestor."
4888,一群长者或男女头人管理其成员的各种事务，并在与其他氏族打交道时充当本群体的代表。,A group of elders or headmen or headwomen regulate the affairs of members and represent their group in relations with other clans.
4888,关于部落中的权威，还有另一种不同情況，即美拉尼西亚的头人，他得先累积财富和政治权力，直到人们承认他是首领分支世系群制度与氏族的运作相似，是以亲属关系为基础的部落组织的罕见形式。,"Another variant of authority in tribes in Melanesia is the Big Man, who builds up his wealth and political power until he must be reckoned with as a leader.The segmentary lineage system, similar in operation to the clan, is a rare form of tribal organization based on kinship bonds."
4889,这里我们正在追溯一种特别新近的对于与我们最主要的本性（激情）相联系的自我的看法。,"Here we are tracing a particular recent view of self in relation to our baser natures, the passions."
4889,这是一种西方观点，但是我们也可以在东方的宗教运动中找到对应物，特别是伊斯兰教和佛教，这些东方宗教运动大致与基督教的诞生处在相同时期。,"This is a Western view, but one also finds parallels in Eastern religious movements, roughly contemporaneous with the origin of Christianity, notably Islam and Buddhism."
4889,中国的例子在李约瑟的研究中得到详尽的阐释。,Chinese examples are noted in studies by Joseph Needham.
4889,伊斯兰教认为，激情可以通过理智和道德伦理来控制。,Islam sees passions (nafsu) controlled by reason (akal) and ethics (achlak).
4889,爪哇神秘主义教派，将伊斯兰教与佛教的影响融合到一起，将激情描述成颜色（像红色），这一颜色除非是受到其他颜色（像黑色和白色）的阻拦（一种由沉思产生的控制方式），否则就有可能爆发出来。,Javanese mystical cults that unite Muslim and Buddhist influences depict the passions as colors (such as red) that threaten to explode unless dampened by other colors(such as black and white) – a kind of control brought about by meditation.
4890,我们离开纳亚尔人之前，重要的是要指出，在他们的社会，没有任何东西是与北美社会的已知家庭类似的。,"Before we leave the Nayar, it is important to note that nothing in this society is comparable to the family as we know it in North America."
4890,"形成家户的群体不包括姻亲(affinal kin),即由婚 姻建立夫妻关系(conjugal bond)所加入的那些个人就如在第九章我们将证明的，家户并不非得是像我们所知道的那种家庭。","The group that forms the household does not include affinal kin, or individuals joined by a conjugal bond established by marriage.As will be shown in Chapter 9, a household group does not have to be a family as we know it."
4890,在纳亚尔人中，家户完全是由我们通常所谓的“血缘”亲属组成的，“血缘”亲属技术上被称为血亲（consanguineal kin)。,"Among the Nayar the household is composed wholly of what we often call ""blood"" relatives,lechnicallknowacon-sanguineal kin."
4890,性关系是与非血亲、因此而住在另一个家户的那些人的关系。,Sexual relations are with those who are not consanguineal kin and thus live in other households.
4890,这把我们引 向另一个人类普遍的问题:乱伦禁忌。,"This brings us to another supposed human universal, the incest taboo."
4891,如果丈夫去世了，留下妻子和儿女，通常有这种风俗，这个妻子就与已故丈夫的兄弟之一结婚，这种风俗被称为夫兄弟婚（levirate）。它不仅为寡妇及其儿女 提供了社会保障，而且也是这个丈夫的家族维护对于她的性权利和对于她未来儿女权利的一种方法。它的作用在于保持先前已经确立的关系。,"If a husband dies, leaving a wife and children, it is often the custom that the wife marry one of the brothers of the dead man.This custom, called the levirate, not only provides social security for the widow and her children but also is a way for the husband's family to maintain their rights over her sexuality and her future children: It acts to preserve relationships previously established."
4891,如果一个男子与其已故妻子的姐妹结婚，就被称为妻姐妹婚从本质上说，“嫁妻”的家庭给“娶妻”的家庭提供了另一个配偶来代替死者的位置。,"When a man marries the sister of his dead wife, it is called the sororate; in essence, a family of ""wife givers"" supplies one of ""wife takers"" with another spouse to take the place of the one who died."
4892,从1840年到1917年，随着欧洲殖民地的奴隶制的废除，几百万印度人被运送到遥远的殖民地，并在那里永久定居。,"From 1840 to 1917, following the abolition of slavery in the European colonies, several million Indians were transported to remote colonies where they settled permanently."
4892,这次大群迁移的原因是奴隶解放以后的种植园对于新的人力的需要。,The cause for this mass migration was the need for fresh manpower in the plantations after the freeing of the slaves.
4892,许多人已经指出，这些印度人，被劳动合同所诱惑，实际上是被诱骗了，他们在种植园侨民区的真实处境很难比原先的奴隶更好。,"Many have argued that these Indians, tempted by promising labour contracts, were virtually shanghaied and that their actual situation in the plantation colonies were scarcely better than that of the slaves had been."
4892,休·廷克 （Hugh Tinker 1974）把这种服务契约期间的制度描述为《一种新的奴隶制形式》（也可参见Mintz 1974）。,Hugh Tinker (1974) has described the system of indentureship as A New Form of Slavery (see also Mintz 1974).
4892,大部分印度人来自比哈尔邦 （Bihar）和北方邦（Uttar）——印度的一些最贫穷的地方——但也有相当数量的人是说德拉威语（Dravidian）的，来自泰米尔纳德 （Tamil Nadu）和安德拉邦（Andhra）。,Most of the Indians came from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh – some of the most impoverished parts of India – but a fair number were also Dravidian speakers from Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh.
4893,还有其他原因导致漂流者形象成为民族志作者所向往的乌托邦式的自我形象。,There are other reasons why the image of the castaway is an evocative and Utopian self-image for the ethnographer.
4893,因为正如海伦娜˙瓦莱罗、弗洛林达˙多内尔和汉斯˙施塔德这些例子所揭示的那样，漂流者与俘虏在很多方面实现了参与观察者的理想。,"For as the figures of Helena Valero, Florinda Donner, and Hans Stade suggest, castaways and captives in many ways realize the ideal of the participantobserver."
4893,民族志作者高于“单纯的旅行者”的权威性主要来自于这样一种观念：旅行者只是走马观花_面民族志作者是和他所研究的群体一同生活的。,"The authority of the ethnographer over the ""mere traveler"" rests chiefly on the idea that the traveler just passes through, whereas the ethnographer lives with the group under study."
4893,但是，这当然也正是漂流者和俘虏通常所做的，他们在另一种文化中以各种身份生活，髙到王子，低到奴隶，他们学习当地人的语言和生活方式，所达到的程度是任何民族志作者都会嫉妒的，而且他们经常记叙自己的故事，这些记述内 容充实、丰富和准确，也真正达到了民族志本身的标准。,"But of course this is what captives and castaways often do too, living in another culture in every capacity from prince to slave, learning indigenous languages and lifeways with a prohciency any ethnographer would envy, and often producing accounts that are indeed full, rich, and accurate by ethnography's own standards."
4893,同时，俘虏的经历在许多方面与田野工作的经历有共通之处——依赖感、缺乏控制、不是完全被孤立就是永远不得独处。,"At the same time, the experience of captivity resonates a lot with aspects of the experience of fieldwork— the sense o f dependency, lack of control, the vulnerability to being either isolated completely or never left alone."
4894,符号分析是一种通过对某个特殊形式进行详细分析来阐释文化意义的方式。,Symbolic analysis is a way of interpreting the meanings of a culture through detailed analysis of a particular form.
4894,这方面的一个例子就是格尔茨对巴厘人的斗鸡所倣的解释。,An example is Clifford Geertz’s interpretation of the Balinese cockfight.
4894,在巴厘岛，公鸡是一种极其可贵的东西，人们与它们有着密切的关系。,"In Bali, cocks are greatly prized, and men identify strongly with them."
4894,格尔茨分析斗鸡，将其作为巴厘人看待社会现实的一种标志。,Geertz analyzes cock fights as a symbol of the Balinese view of social reality.
4895,土著人保护协会为相关讨论和出版物提供了首个平台，通过这个平台，关于“未开化部落的性格、习惯和需求的真实信息”（Aborigines Protection Society 1837，4)得到编辑和系统化，由此为人类学发展提供了第一个契机。,"The Aborigines Protection Society provided the first forum for discussions and publications in which ""authentic information concerning the character, habits and wants of the uncivilized tribes"" (Aborigines Protection Society 1837, 4) was compiled and systematized, and thus the first point of growth for an anthropological perspective."
4895,尽管成员们都共享人文主义情感，但在那些更强烈地认为福音主义是改善土著人状况理所当然的道路的人与那些认为研究土著人群的任务更具优先性的人之间出现了矛盾。这很快就导致了1844年独立的伦敦人种学学会（Ethnological Society of London)的建立。该学会发展了一个成熟的学术项目，即“对居于或曾经居于地球上的不同人类种群相互区別的身体及精神特征进行研究，并确认产生这些特征的原因”。,"Though the members shared the humanitarian sentiments, tensions emerged between those more strongly committed to evangelism as the self-evident course for the betterment of aborigines, and those who would give greater priority to the task of studying the aboriginal This soon led to the separate establishment in 1844 of the Ethnological Society of London, with a full-fledged scholarly program to ""inquire into distinguishing characteristics, physical and moral, of the varieties. of Mankind which inhabit, or have inhabited, the Earth [and] ascertain the causes of such characteristics."" populations."
4896,列维－斯特劳斯对人类心智共同性的另一重要探寻，就是我们前面所说的第二个例子：以雅克布森的“辅音三角”和“元音三角” 理论为基础的所谓“烹饪三角”。,"One of the most indicative of Le ́vi-Strauss’ excursions into the universality of the human mind is that of our second example: the ‘culinary triangle’, based on Jakobson’s ‘consonant triangle’ and ‘vowel triangle’."
4896,列维－斯特劳斯最早在 1965 年的一篇文章中提出这一观点。而后又对此进行了数次论证，特别是在《神话学》第三卷的结尾部分。（Le ́vi-Strauss 1978b [1968]: 471-95),"Le ́vi-Strauss Wrst published on the idea in an article in 1965, and this was followed by several discussions, notably in the conclusion to the third volume of the Mythologiques (Le ́vi-Strauss 1978b [1968]: 471–95)."
4897,语言是声音或姿势系统，当这些声音或姿势按某些规则组合起来，就产生所有说话者都可理解的意义。,"Language is a system of sounds or gestures that, when put together according to certain rules results in meanings intelligible to all speakers."
4897,虽然人类首先依靠语言相互交流，但它不是唯一的交流 手段。,"Although humans rely primarily on language to communicate with one another, it is not their sole means of communication."
4897,语言根植于手势一呼叫系统，由辅助语言—与语言相伴的语言外的动作—和肢体语言或用来传递意义的身体运动构成。,"Language is embedded in a gesture-call system that consists of paralanguage—extralinguistic noises that accompany language—and kinesics, body motions that convey messages."
4898,姿势-呼叫系统的第二个成分是辅助语言（paralanguage），它由不是语言的一部分而又总是伴随着语言的叫喊和其他声音组成的。,"The second component of the gesture-call system is paralanguage, consisting of cries and other sounds that are not part of language but always accompany it."
4898,“关键不在于说了什么，而 在于怎么说的”，这个评论暗示了辅助语言的重要性。例如，目前的研究业已表明，在措辞、节奏、回答的时间长短等等中，看起来较小的差异所传达的潜意识信息，在法庭诉讼中比最敏锐的出庭律师所可能认识到的远为重要。,"The importance of paralanguage is suggested by this remark: It's not so much what was said as how it was said, Recent studies have shown, for example, that subliminal messages communicated by seemingly minor differences in phraseology, tempo, length of answers and the like are far more important in courtroom proceedings than even the most perceptive trial lawyer may have realized."
4898,除此以外，在证据中有不一致的情况中，证人给出证据的方式，改变了证据从法官那里得到承认的程度，而且也影响证人的可信度。,"Among other things, how a witness gives testimony alters the reception it gets from jurors, and bears on the witness credibility where inconsistencies exist in testimony."
4899,的确，人们通常期待孩子的父亲为孩子提供资助，但是，就50%的婚外出生儿童而言，父权是不可能确立的。,"To be sure, fathers of children are usually expected to provide child support but in 50% of the cases of children born out of wedlock, paternity cannot be established."
4899,此外，父亲无法履行其义务也决不是罕见的。,"Furthermore, failure of fathers to live up to their obligations is far from rare."
4899,为了得到其他成年人的资助，未婚女子的一种解决办法是结婚(经常是，再婚）。,"One solution for unmarried women is to marry (often, to remarry) to get the assistance of another adult."
4900,在家系社会中，交换妇女的是以团体为单位而不是以个人。,"In lineage societies, it is corporations rather than persons who exchange women."
4900,如果一个社会由两个相互间有规律地交换妇女的家族群体组成，这个社会就可以分为两个半偶族。,"If a society consists of two kin groups who regularly exchange women between them, the society is divided into moieties."
4900,通常，半偶族在交换妇女以外，也有一种劳动的分工。,"Frequently, moieties have a division of labour in addition to exchanging women."
4900,交换的半偶族系统在澳洲民族中流行很广。,The moiety system of exchange is widespread among Australian peoples.
4900,对这些婚姻系统的研究显示，半偶族系统的后果最终就是交表婚的一种类型。,"In studies of these marriage systems, it has been pointed out that the outcome of a moiety system is eventually a kind of classificatory cross-cousin marriage."
4900,它是这样发生的：在一个很小的群体中，就像澳洲中部的卡瑞拉（Kariera），社会中的所有成员互为亲戚。,"It happens like this: in a fairly small group, like the Kariera of Central Australia, all members of society define themselves as relatives."
4900,他们计算父系血统并以两个异族通婚的“婚姻种类”的形式被组织起来，他们能够与任何一个没有被归类为同胞的性别合适的人结婚。,"They reckon patrilineal descent and are organised in two exogamous ""marriage classes"".They can marry anyone of the right gender who is not classified as a sibling."
4901,毫不奇怪，因为由妇女当家的家户数增加，所以生活在贫困线以下的妇女 (当然还有她们的孩子）的数目也增加了（参见图9.5）。在美国，超过三分之一的由妇女当家的家户归入这一类别，还有四分之一的儿童生活在贫困之中。,"Not surprisingly, as the number of female-headed households has increased, so has the number of women (and, of course, their children) who live below the poverty line.More than one third of all female-headed households in the United States now fall into this category, and one quarter of all children are poor (Figure 9.4)."
4901,此外，这些妇女和儿童还是受1980年以来社会福利计划开支削减影响最深的一批人。,"Moreover, these women and children are the ones most severely affected by cutbacks made in social welfare programs since 1980."
4901,即使在那之前，妇女的购买力也在下降，并且从那以后，对妇女和儿童帮助最大的政府计划又到了程度最深的削减。,"Even before then, the purchasing power of women was declining, and, ever since, the programs that most assisted women and children have suffered the deepest cuts."
4902,格鲁克曼描绘传统社会的关系为“复合”，意思是说每种关系都包括许多层面和方面。,"Max Gluckman has characterized relationships in traditional societies as ""multiplex"", by which is meant that every relationship includes many levels and aspects."
4902,一个人的表兄弟也是一个人的合作者、邻居、老师、首领和公公。,"One's cousin is also one's co-worker, neighbor, teacher, chief, and father-in-law."
4902,建立在这样一种复合社会关系基础之上的社区，就像缠绕一起错综复杂的绳索织成的一张大网。,A community based on such multiplex social relationships is like a net of inextricably tangled thick ropes.
4902,在这样一个社区，社会秩序以一种深刻得从未体验过它的我们无法想象的方式无所不包，并深深地影响到所有人。,"In such a community, the social order is heavy and all-encompassing, in a way too profound for those of us who have never experienced it to imagine."
4903,这位历史学家借用民族志的权威，使他自己能够以一种未经调适的方式来理解中世纪晚期农民的生活形式。,"The historian adopts ethnographic authority to enable him to apprehend, in unmediated fashion, late medieval peasant forms of life."
4903,他觉得他有资格这样做的意识容许他去直接地理解在历史上遥远的制度和文化的意义。,His sense of entitlement allows the direct apprehension of historically distant institutions and cultural meanings.
4903,勒华拉杜里不是去担心翻译的问题，而是采用虚假的关于复调（让他的声音和农民们的声音同样地被听到）的民族志权威，让那些用斜体写下的段落代表直接从往昔传承下来的直接引文[其实，这些农民——必须牢记在心的是，他们是在一个宗教裁判法庭坦白交代——通常都是讲奥克西坦尼话（Occitan)。他们所讲的，在当时被翻译成拉丁文记载下来，现在这位历史学家又把记录翻译成现代法语]。,"Rather than worrying over problems of translation, Le Roy Ladurie deploys the false ethnographic authority of polyphony, his voice and peasant voices equally heard, by citing in italics passages that represent direct quotations transmitted directly from the past (though the peasants—who were, it must be kept in mind, confessing before an inquisition court—usually spoke Occitan, which scribes then translated into Latin, which the historian has translated into modern French)."
4904,对话模式原则上不是自传性的；它们并不必然导致过度的自我意识或自我专注。,"Dialogical modes are not, in principle, autobiographical; they need not lead to hyper self-consciousness or self-absorption."
4904,如巴赫金（Bakhtin 1981)指出的，在任何复杂地再现的话语空间（民族志的话语空间，或者在巴赫金的例子里，现实主义小说的话语空间对话过程都层出不穷，众声喧哗。,"As Bakhtin (1981) has shown, dialogical processes proliferate in any complexly represented discursive space (that of an ethnography, or, in his case, a realist novel).Many voices clamor for expression."
4904,在传统民族志中，通过给一个声音以压倒性的权威功能，而把其他人当作可以引用或转写其言语的信息来源，“被访人”，复调性受到限制和整编。,"Polyvocality was restrained and orchestrated in traditional ethnographies by giving to one voice a pervasive authorial function and to others the role of sources, ""informants,"" to be quoted or paraphrased."
4904,一旦承认对话论和复调是文本生产的模式，单声部的权威就受到质疑，这种权威也被揭示为一门主张再现文化的科学的特性。,"Once dialogismi and polyphony are recognized as modes of textual production, monophonie authority is questioned, revealed to be characteristic of a science that has claimed to represent cultures."
4905,但现在所称的复兴运动（revitalization movements），绝不仅仅局限于殖民地界，仅在美国就有数百起这样的运动爆发。,"Yet revitalization movements, as they are now called, are by no means restricted to the colonial world, and in the United States alone hundreds of such movements have sprung up."
4905,比较广为人知的有创立于19世纪的摩门教，最近由文鲜明教士所创的统一教会，还有以大卫˙科里什为“先知”的大 卫教派信徒，以及由马歇尔·赫夫˙阿普尔怀特和邦尼卢·特鲁兹戴尔·内特尔斯领导的天堂之门。,"Among the more widely known are Mormonism, which began in the 19th century; the more recent Unification Church of the Reverend Sun Myung Moon; the Branch Davidians whose ""prophet"" was David Koresh; and the Heaven's Gate cultled by Marshall Herf Applewhite and Bonnie Lu Trousdale Nettles."
4905,正如这四个例子暗示的，复兴运动极其多样的表现形式，一些形式比另一些要成功得多。,"As these four examples suggest, revitalization movements show a great deal of diversity, and some have been much more successful than others."
4906,在一个极端，田野工作导致参与一个特定的群体，了解关于那一群体的知识。,"At one extreme, fieldwork leads to involvement with a particular group and to learning about that group."
4906,民族志学者与那一群体产生共鸣/身份认同，那一群体变成“我的村庄”、“我的部落 ”或“我的人民”。,"The ethnographer identifies with that group, which becomes ""my village,"" ""my tribe,"" or ""my people."""
4906,然后他成为一名臭名远扬的反对者。,He then becomes a notorious nay-sayer.
4906,对每一关于人类行为的概化，他都想要说：“我的人民不那样去做它。”（就像印度尼西亚谚语所说的，“不同的村庄有着不同的习惯”；特殊化阻止概化。）,"To every generalization that is posed about human conduct, he is tempted to say, ""My people don't do it that way."" (As the Indonesian proverb has it, “Lain desa, lain adat"" [""another village, another custom""]; particularism blocks generalization.)"
4907,因为早期灵长目动物变成栖树者，所以在牙齿、感官、脑和骨骼结构等许多方面发生了改变，这就有助于他们调适于环境。,"As the early primates became tree dwellers, various modifications occurred—in dental characteristics, sense organs, the brain, and skeletal structure—that helped them to adapt to their environment."
4907,另外，习得的社会行为对他们来说变得越来越重要。,"In addition, learned social behavior became increasingly important to them."
4907,通过研究现时灵长目动物的行为，人类学家寻找线索，重建可能具有像类人猿那样灵长目动物特点的行为模式，这些灵长目动物既是人类也是现时类人猿的祖先。,"By studying the behavior of present-day primates, anthropologists seek clues for reconstructing behavioral patterns that may have characterized the apelike primates ancestral to both humans and present-day apes."
4908,正如贝特森（Bateson 1958:96)说的那样，在人的世界中，贝克莱的名言不容置疑：“存在就是被感知”。,"In the world of human being, as Bateson has it (1958:96), the Berkeleyan motto cannot be faulted:"" To be is to be perceived""."
4908,此外，很重要的一点就是必须强调个体才是感知或理解世界过程中的“能量源泉”（Bateson 1972: 126)。,"Moreover, it is important to emphasize that it is the individual who is the ""energy source"" behind this act of worldly perception or interpretation (Bateson 1972:126)."
4908,知识是个体性的、主观的，源自个体具有感知能力的身体.其背后的动机、活动和习惯都体现了个体的能动性。,"Knowledge is individual and subjective, deriving from individuals' sensitive bodies, and the drive, the work and the habitude behind this are exemplifications of individual agency."
4908,带有习惯的认知特别重要。,This is especially important to recognize with regard to habit.
4909,就刚才引述的这个例子而言，由于人类学坚守文化相对主义的立场，使得我们能理解门徳人女性成年礼割除阴蒂的这一做法。,"In the case just cited, the anthropological commitment to cultural relativism permits an understanding of the practice of clitoridectomy (removal of the clitoris) in the Mende female initiation rites."
4909,但正如在本书前面部分（参见第二章）讨论过的那样，文化相对主义并不排除人类学家对一种既定习俗提出批评。,"But as discussed earlier in this book (see Chapter 2), cultural relativism does not preclude the anthropologist from criticizing a given practice."
4909,在这个案例中，割除阴蒂(如同切除包皮一样)是一种生殖器伤残形式，而且是特别危险的那种形式。,"In this case, removal of the clitoris (like male circumcision) is a form of genital mutilation, and a particularly dangerous one at that."
4909,"某些形式的生殖器伤残——从割除阴蒂到切除整个女性外阴, 包括封闭部分的阴道口（在需要性交时就用外科手术打开，或者甚至撕开，生完孩子后重新封闭，直到男性再次有性交欲望才打开)一直到今天仍影响着世界上大约8000万的妇女，而在非洲尤其普遍，在28个国家中时有发生(每年至少有200万少 女面临这种危险）。","Some form of genital mutilation, ranging from the removal of the clitoris to the removal of the entire external female genitalia, including the partial closing of the vaginal opening (surgically opened for intercourse and closed again after a birth until the male again desires intercourse), affects an estimated 80 million women in the world today and is particularly widespread in Africa, where it occurs in 28 countries."
4910,第十版的大部分新内容（在下面列出）以某种方式与性别相关。,Much of the new content for the ninth edition (listed below) relates to gender in some way.
4910,这些变化一般至少属于下述三个范畴之一：学科内关于性别的思想变化；在特殊社会或文化中，在性别方面有重要分歧的实例；以及关于性别和性別关系的跨文化含义。,"These changes generally fall into at least one of three categories: changes in thinking about gender within the discipline, examples that have important ramifications on gender in a particular society or culture, and cross-cultural implications about gender and gender relations."
4910,新素材的实例包括：对同性恋身份和同性婚姻的讨论，有关类人猿社会雌性角色的当前思考，以及关于女性割阴的最近新闻。,
4910,,Examples of new material range from an expanded definition of marriage and additional material on homosexual identity to current thinking on the role of Hadza women in food provisioning and recent news in regard to female genital mutilation.
4911,音位/主位是在某种语言或文化中有意义区别的层次。,The emic is the level of meaningful contrasts within a particular language or culture.
4911,我们可以根据许多框架（framework)和格栅（grid)来解释音位/主位的特征。,We can explain emic distinctions in terms of various frameworks or grids.
4911,最典型的例子包括：林奈氏分类系统、医学中疾病、光波长度的测量、音乐中半音音阶的衡量，还有最重要的谱系的格栅。,"Classic examples include Linnaean taxonomy; disease, in medical science; the measurement of the wavelength of light; the chromatic scale in music; and above all, the genealogical grid."
4912,道格拉斯早期的著作很直截了当，对经济和宗教有特殊的兴趣。,"Douglas’ early work was quite straightforward, with special interests in economics and religion."
4912,后者促使她研究莱勒人、古希波来人和英国人中的纯洁和败坏。,"The latter led her to studies of purity and pollution among the Lele, among the ancient Hebrews, and in Britain."
4912,她第一本成名作（但不是处女作）是《纯洁和危险》（Douglas 1966)。,Her frrst famous book (though not her first book) was Purity and Danger (1966).
4912,书中她考察了这些概念，并暗示了这种分析方式，很快这种分析方式在她的《自然符号》（Douglas 1969)—书中得到发展：《自然符号》和她其后的许多大部分著作都使用了她所谓的“格栅/群分析法”（参见 Douglas 1978; 1982; 1996)。,"There she examined concepts such as these and hinted at the form of analysis which she was soon to develop in Natural Symbols (1969): Natural Symbols and most of her many subsequent publications have utilized the framework she calls ‘grid/group analysis’ (see also, e.g., Douglas 1978; 1982; 1996)."
4913,要强调社会或文化的一统，就会忽略多样性；要强调稳定性，就会忽略变动。,
4913,,To emphasize constancy is to ignore change.
4913,为了简化或概括主要特征，强调这些重点是有必要的，但是人类学家已经发现，与此同时也很有必要增加其他方法，以更好地应对多样性和变动性。,"These characteristic emphases are necessary in order to simplify and summarize major features, but anthropologists have found it necessary to add other approaches better able to cope with diversity and change."
4913,其中一种这样的方法就是源出于功能主义的个案研究，另一种方法则是源出于结构主义的符号分析。,"One such approach is the case study method, growing out of functionalism, and the other, symbolic analysis, growing out of configurationalism."
4914,个体主义从属于特定的历史 和文化对个人或自我的概念化过程。,Individualism pertains to a particular historico-cultural conceptualization of the person or self.
4914,这一过程包含人作为个体的终极价 值和尊严、他在道德和精祌上的自治、他的理性和自我知识、他的灵 性、隐私权、自我统治、自我发展以及自愿选择加人某一社会、市场或 政治组织的权利（Lukes 1990)。,"Included within this conceptualization would be notions of the ultimate value and dignity of the human individual, hismoral and intellectual autonomy, his rationality and self-knowledge, spirituality, right to privacy, self-sovereignty and self-development, and his voluntary contracting into a society, market and polity (cf. Lukes 1990)."
4914,与此相对，个体性指的是人的普遍特征，即只有个体才具有能动性。,"Individuality, by contrast, refers to the universal nature of human existence whereby it is individuals who possess agency."
4914,不过，由于个体通过各种各样的感知机制（神经系统和大脑）与其他个体相关联，例如各个身体中的意识的各种各样的认识中心，所以他们的能动性总是必须符合世界的某些特定方面。,"Moreover, since individuals engage with others by virtue of discrete sense-making apparatuses (nervous systems and brains)—discrete centres of consciousness in discrete bodies—their agency necessarily accords withdistinct perspectives on the world."
4915,个体主义将整体看成是由部分组成。,Individualism sees the whole made from the parts.
4915,一个人从部分（即个体）开始，逐步构建整体（即社会）。,"One starts with the parts, namely individuals, and builds wholes, namely societies."
4915,部分，即个体，是最基本、最真实、最自然的现实。,"The parts, the individuals, are the basic, real, and natural reality."
4915,就像霍布斯所说，一个人也可以构建起一个联邦共和国，但是这一整体是人为的和易碎的。,"One can,as Hobbes suggested, construc a commonwealth, but this whole is artificial and fragile."
4916,我的理论视角和历史学家的不尽相同，但我却依靠了他们的研究和发现。此外，我的理论视角也不同于法律史学家，但是我会引用他们的观点和结论。,"My theoretical concern is not quite that of the historians, though I rely upon their findings, nor is it that of the constitutional historians, though I am indebted to their conclusions."
4916,我也不会像一位结构人类学家那样从“神话分析”的角度将贝克特传奇故事的诸多不同版本与原初的加以对照分析——以此区别于需要详尽文献资料的贝克特历史研究。,"Nor am I operating as a structural anthropologist who might fruitfully analyze the variations of the original Becket legend—as distinct from the abundantly documented Becket history—in terms of ""mythemic"" analysis."
4916,我本人是一名社会人类学家，长期以来倾向于微观事件的研究。社会戏剧这一理论框架形成于我对中非小型村落社会的研究过程中，此后我将这一理论运用于冰岛中世纪地方血仇的研究，因此我也试图运用这一理论对贝克特进行研究。,Since I am a social anthropologist with a long-term bias toward the analysis ofniicjoevents I shall use the social dramatistic framework that I developed first in the study of small-scale central African village societies and have later begun to apply to the local feuds of medieval Iceland.
4916,我认为在那些主要社会参与者的头脑中存在着一些文化模式，他们肯定清楚地意识到了这些文化模式的存在 (但却不能有意识地对其加以把握），我将这些文化模式称作根范式。,But I shall use this framework primarily as a device for isolating from the sequence of events dominated by the Becket-Henry confrontation those which unambiguously evince the presence and activity of certain consciously recognized (though not consciously grasped) cultural models in the heads of the main actors which I shall call root paradigms.
4917,"布莱克更倾向于使用“概念性原型""（conceptual archetype）这一术语来替代“根隐喻”，他对“概念性原型”的解释是“任何一个思考者进行描述时都必须借助的系统性的思想的全部，人们只有通过类比性的延伸才能对一些领域进行描述，因为这些系统性的思想尚不能直接运用于这些领域”（Black，1962:241）。","Black prefers the term ""conceptual archetype"" to ""root metaphor,"" and defines it as a ""systematic repertoire of ideas by means of which a given thinker describes, by analogical extension, some domain to which those ideas do not immediately and literally apply"" (1962:241)."
4917,他认为，如果我们对一种特定的原型进行详尽的描述，就必须使用一系列的关键词和表述方式，并且还要说明它们之间的联系以及它们在最初的那一领域中的范式意义。,"He suggests that if we want a detailed account of a particular archetype, we require a list of key words and expressions, with statements of their interconnections and their paradigmatic meanings in the field from which they were originally drawn.This should then be supplemented"
4917,最后，还需要分析最初的意义通过何种途径延伸其隐喻的用法。,
4918,田园诗的形式毕竟起源于宫廷，并且我们会发现，其中的牧羊人通常实质上就是穿着乡村服装的皇室成员。,"The pastoral mode, after all, derives from the court, and its shepherds usually turn out to have been royalty dressed in rustic garb."
4918,作为一种文学肜式，它与中世纪晚期法国的牧羊人毫不相干，也与当代尼罗河流域那些养牲口的人毫不相干。,"As a literary mode, it stands far removed from either late medieval French shepherds or contemporary Nilotic cattle herders."
4918,恰怡相反，它表现了一种明显的殷勤的感觉，肯尼思˙伯克曾经灵敏地把它概括为“形成鲜明对比的社会阶级之间求爱的修辞”（Burke 1969:123)。,"Instead it embodies a distinctive sense of courtesy that Kenneth Burke has aptly characterized as ""the rhetoric of courtship between contrasted social classes"" (1969:123)."
4918,在较早的文学发展阶段，这种求爱在贵族与平民之间、在王公与封臣的阶级之间、在主子与仆从之间一再发生。,"In earlier literary epochs this courtship occurred between nobles and commoners, lords and vassals, and masters and servants."
4918,作为类比，这种移植的现代田园诗又出现在城镇与乡村、中产阶级与工人阶级、殖民者与被殖民者之间的互动之中。,"The displaced modern pastoral analogously emerges in interactions between town and country, middle class and working class, and colonizer and colonized."
4919,即使在第一个国家出现以后，大多数人仍然过着集体生活，政府、共同体和亲属关系都排在个体前面。,"Even after the first states were organized, most of life was lived collectively, with government, community, and kinship having priority over the individual."
4919,像我们现今所了解的“个体”概念，是宗教改革、文艺复兴和工业革命的一个产物，其真正存在只有几百年时间。即便如此，它也仅局限在西欧和它的殖民地。,"The concept of the individual as we know it really came to exist only a few hundred years ago, as a product of the Reformation, Renaissance, and industrial revolution, and even then it was confined to Western Europe and its colonies."
4919,在人类历史上，集体主义比个体主义占有更大的位置。,Collectivism has a larger place in human history than individualism.
4920,随着欧洲和北美的工业化，核心家庭变得更加独立于其他亲戚。,"With the industrialization of Europe and North America, the nuclear family became further isolated from other kin."
4920,其原因之一是，工处经济需要流动的劳动力。人们必须准备随工作而迁移，而这只有在没有拖带多余亲戚的情况下才最容易做到。,"One reason is that industrial economies require a mobile labor force; people must be prepared to move where the jobs are, which they do most easily without excess kin in tow."
4920,另一个原因是，人们认为公共世界对其隐私意识和独立自主构成威胁，家庭则是避开这种威胁的避难所家庭内部的关系想必是持久的和非偶然的，需要爱和情感，建立在合作的基础之上，并受感情和道德的支配。,"Another reason is that the family came to be seen as a kind of refuge from a public world people saw as threatening to their sense of privacy and self-determination.Within the family, relationships were supposed to be enduring and noncontingent, entailing love and affection, based upon cooperation, and governed by feeling and morality."
4921,仪式过程中， 参与者要通过阙限阶段 ( liminal phase) (在拉丁文“ 开端” 之后，范盖内普的术语），特纳以公共域 ( communitas ) 一词来说明其特征。,"In the ritual process, participants pass through a liminal phase (as van Gennep termed it, after the Latin for ‘threshold’), which is characterized by what Turner called communitas."
4921,公共域是“社会结构”的“非结构”界域，在该界域中，正式的个体等级常常会颠倒过来，或者等级的象征会颠倒过来。,"Communitas is an ‘unstructured’ realm of ‘social structure’, where often the normal ranking of individuals is reversed or the symbols of rank inverted."
4921,按照结构主义观点（很明显 ， 特纳是曼彻斯特学派中的结构主义者），公共域可能会被看成同时既是某一物又不是那一物这样一种界域（见维恩图， 图表 6.I）,"In structural terms (and there is a clear sense in which Turner was the structuralist of the Manchester School), one might envisage it as a realm which is simultaneously one thing and not that thing (as in the Venn diagram, Wgure 6.1)"
4922,人们认为需要进入政治团体的正是受人尊敬的工薪阶层男性。,It was respectable working men who were deemed to be ready for inclusion in the body politic.
4922,有关哪些英国男人应该授予公民权，哪些人总受制于改革联盟(Reform League)的政治流动的讨论持续了两年。,"Two years of debate took place over precisely which British men should be ‘given’ the franchise, debate which was always framed by the political mobilisation of the Reform League."
4922,法案通过前，工人大规模的游行延续了几个月，向议员显示了其他形式的力量。,"Enormous demonstrations of men took place in the months preceding the passing of the act, reminding those in parliament of other forms of power."
4923,我们可以设想，一个平稳地发挥功能的社会，就像一个健康的有机体，是由整合在更大体系中的许多部分构成的；而这些体系每一个都有自己的特定的功能效用，与其他体系一起协同工作。,"We can imagine a society functioning smoothly like a healthy organism, made of many parts put together in larger systems; and these systems, each with its own special purpose of function, working together with the others."
4923,社会具有与那些有机体类似的结构。,Societies have structures similar to those of organisms.
4923,社 会制度就像身体的组成部分，一起在更大的体系中发挥功能。,"Social institutions, like the parts of the body, function together within larger systems."
4924,作为民族志分析的一个模型，功能主义的目标主要是为了展现一个群体如何发挥各自的功能正常运转——它将群体描述成一个持续运转的系统。,"As a mode of ethnographic analysis, the objective of functionalism is simply to show how a group functions – to depict the group as a working system."
4924,这方面的一个例子来自民族志功能主义之父马林诺夫斯基（Bronislaw Malinowski)。,"An example comes from the father of ethnographic functionalism, Bronislaw Malinowski."
4924,马林诺夫斯基描述了一种位于特罗布里恩岛的交换模式，它被叫作库拉（Kula)圈。,Malinowski portrays a pattern of exchange in the Trobriand Islands known as the Kula ring.
4924,库拉圈的伙伴们在延伸到周围数百英里的海岛的范围内，按照顺时针方向用项链交换镯子，另一方则按照反方向进行交换。,"Kula partners exchange bracelets for necklaces between islands stretching for hundreds of miles, one set of items passing clockwise Method around the circle and the other counterclockwise."
4925,“功能主义”是一个含义宽广的术语。,‘Functionalism’ is a broad term.
4925,最广义说，它包括（狭义的）功能主义和结构—功能主义。,"In its widest sense, it includes both functionalism (narrowly defined) and structural-functionalism."
4925,我主要用该词较窄的含义，也就是涉及到与布罗尼斯拉夫•马林诺夫斯基及其追随者、著名的雷蒙德•弗思爵士有关的理念。,"I use it mainly in the narrower sense, that is, to refer to ideas associated with Bronislaw Malinowski and his followers, notably Sir Raymond Firth."
4925,这种观点主要关注个体行为，关注社会制度强加给个体的限制，关注个体需求与那些需求通过文化与社会框架实现满足之间的关系。,"It is the perspective concerned with actions among individuals, the constraints imposed by social institutions on individuals, and relations between the needs of an individual and the satisfaction of those needs through cultural and social frameworks."
4926,与类形学倡导共变和规律相对，定律则是明确地陈述那些共变。,"Whereas typologies suggest covariations and regularities, laws state those covariations explicitly."
4926,就像在刚刚提到的演化模式中，一个人能够看到一般的趋向，像运动从简单到复杂（例如，在具体的社会组织的意义上，狩猎和采集社会趋向于是平等主义，农业和工业社会则趋向于有不同的阶级）。,"In an evolutionary scheme like that just mentioned, for example, one can see general trends such as the movement from simple to complex (in the specific sense of social organization, for example, where hunting and gathering societies tend to be egalitarian, whereas agrarian and industrial societies differentiate into classes)."
4926,我们可以将这样一种趋向描述成一条定律，比如说，能量使用增加，社会复杂性就会随之增加。,"Such a trend can be stated as a kind of law, to the effect, say, that an increase in energy use increases social complexity."
4927,"由于共同利益社团在性质上很有弹性, 所以无论是在城市，还是传统的乡村，他们在弥补社会结构在这方面的差异的作用愈加显著。","Because common-interest associations are by nature quite flexible, they are increasingly, both in cities and in traditional villages, filling this gap in the social structure."
4927,然而，共同利益社团不只存在于现代化的社会，它们也存在于很多传统社会之中。而且我们有理由相信，它们随第一批园艺农业村庄兴起而产生。,"Common-interest associations are not, however, restricted to modernizing societies alone.They also are found in many traditional societies, and there is reason to believe they arose with the emergence of the first horticultural villages."
4927,"此外,传统社会中的社团可能像诸如美国和加拿大等国家中的社团一样复杂和具有高度的组织性。","Furthermore, associations in traditional societies may be just as complex and highly organized as those of countries such as the United States and Canada."
4928,在利奇之前，前功能主义田野民族志在描述克钦人时，认为他们基本具有统一的文化和社会组织。,"Before Leach, pre-functionalist ethnographic accounts of the Kachin described them as having an essentially uniform culture and social organization."
4928,当利奇写作时，功能主义人类学正处于全盛期，该理论认为存在一种稳定平衡，并想当然地认为，田野民族志作者要调查的社会中存在着一种单一的社会体系。,"The functionalist anthropology prevalent when Leach wrote his book assumed a balanced equilibrium, and it took for granted the existence of a single social system within which the ethnographer would work."
4928,"与此相反，利奇集中探讨了两个关系密切的氏族分类的亲属制度和政治制度的不同结构安排一种制度是平等主义的贡老制（gumko),另一个是对同样事务安排的等级制的贡萨制（gumsa)。","In contrast to both, Leach focuses on the different structural arrangements in the kinship and political systems of two closely related groupings of clans, one system being egalitarian (gumlao) and the other a hierarchical version of the same thing (gumsa)."
4929,当一个人进入更深的出神状态时，大脑就开始试图“理解”这些抽象的形式，就好像它在正常意识状态下对接收到的感觉进行处理一样。,"As one goes into deeper trance, the brain tries to ""make sense"" of these abstract forms, just as it does of sensations received when in an unaltered state of consciousness."
4929,这一过程被称为解释构建(construal)，在这里，文化和经验的差别开始起作用了。,"This process is known as construal, and here differences in culture and experience come into play."
4929,"一般来说一个处于出神状态中的布须曼人,会把格子图案解释成长颈鹿皮肤上的斑纹，而把网状曲线解释成一个蜂巢(蜂蜜是布须曼人的一种美食，而经常伴随着出神产生的“嗡嗡嗡”的听觉则加重了幻觉），而点则被解释成“那母”——只有处于出神状态中的萨满才能看见的力量。","Commonly, a Bushman in trance will construe a grid pattern as the markings on a giraffe's skin, nested curves as a honeycomb (honey is a Bushman delicacy, and the auditory sensation of buzzing that often accompanies trance promotes the illusion), and dots as the potency only shamans in trance see."
4929,"显然，我们不会期望一个伊努伊特人，或某个来自洛杉矶的人,也以同样的方式来解释这些图案。","Obviously, we would not expect an Inuit or someone from Los Angeles to construe these patterns in the same way."
4930,从“思想史”角度看，古希腊哲学家和旅行家、中世纪阿拉伯史学家、中世纪和文艺复兴时期的欧洲旅行家，后来的欧洲哲学家、法理学家及各种各样的科学家们，都似乎可以算作是人类学的先驱。,"From a ""history of ideas"" point of view, the writings of ancient Greek philosophers and travellers, medieval Arab historians, medieval and Renaissance European travellers, and later European philosophers, jurists, and scientists of various kinds, are all plausible precursors."
4930,然而，我个人则倾向于联系“社会契约”的概念和人类天性、社会，以及源自该概念的文化多样性等观念开始探讨人类学。,"My choice, though, would be with the concept of the ""social contract"", and the perceptions of human nature, society, and cultural diversity which emerged from this concept."
4930,这就是我在本书中的起点。,This is where I shall begin.
4930,另外一个原本无关的起点是生命巨链（Great Chain of Being)的观点，它将人类位置确定在神和动物之间。,"Another, essentially unrelated, beginning is the idea of the Great Chain of Being, which deWned the place of the human species as between God and the animals."
4931,他对最后一个问题在不同时期的著作中表述了不同的观点，但是，其经典观点在《习俗与冲突》一书中已经阐明：将忠诚纽带关系横切加强了社会秩序，社会凝聚力源自冲突本身，甚至“整个系统的存在依赖于更小的亚系统中的冲突的存在”（Gluckman 1955: 21)。,"This last issue was one on which he expressed somewhat different views in different publications, but his classic statements in Custom and Conflict assert that cross-cutting ties of loyalty strengthen the social order, that social cohesion results from conflict itself, and even that ‘the whole system depends on the existence of conflicts in smaller sub-systems’ (Gluckman 1955: 21)."
4931,格拉克曼对非洲土著民族法律感兴趣，包括他们处理争论的方式等。他也给社会人类学带来了新的方法论工具，即著名的“广泛的个案研究”（extended case study)。,"Gluckman’s interest in indigenous African law, including the ways in which disputes are handled, also brought into social anthropology new methodological tools, notably the ‘extended case study’."
4932,文明社会的结构分化号功能专门化，需要一种特殊机构来协调社会的各个部分和各个阶级，将它们结合为一个富于内聚力和卓有成效的整体。,"The differentiation of structure, the specialization of function, of civil society required a special mechanism to co-ordinate the various segments and classes of society and to integrate them into a coherent and effective whole.Such an integrative mechanism was produced."
4932,"这种整合机构产生了，它就是“国家—教会”，即具有世俗与宗教这两个侧面的一种机构,这个国家一教会机构的职能，是维系社会的完整性，防止内部解体和外部力量的破坏。","It was the ""State-Church"" i.e., a mechanism having temporal and ecclesiastical aspects.The function of the state-church is to preserve the integrity of society against dissolution from within and against destruction from outside forces."
4932,"换言之，这个整合机构一方面必需协调各种社会因素，如职业群体，社会阶层与阶级等等，使之和谐相处；另一方面,必须保证社会生活的安全，防止邻邦的侵犯。","In other words, this integrative mechanism must co-ordinate the various elements of society—occupational groups, social strata and classes—and relate them to one another harmoniously, on the one hand, and on the other, the life of the society must be made secure against the aggression of its neighbors."
4933,这场革命虽然最终并未成功，但由于过程化单位无论其数量如何微不足道，都必然会在社会时间中留下符号的沉淀物供我们挖掘。伊达尔戈起义最终失败了，然而这一事件的确切本质却足以使我们产生理论分析的兴趣，它在现实的历史时间中所留下的符号沉积物对于其后发生的戏剧和革命的进程具有潜在的影响力。,"This was an abortive revolution; nevertheless since processual units, even the least of them, leave symbolic deposits in social time, the precise nature of the failure of the Hidalgo Insurrection is of theoretical interest, and its symbolic deposit in actual historical time had potent effects on subsequent dramas and revolutionary processes."
4933,对于伊达尔戈这个人而言，起义确实是失败了，然而在某种意义上而言他又是成的，因为它奠定了一个新的神话，神话中包含着一整套全新的范式、目标，并且激励着墨西哥人为自由独立而奋斗不息。,"It was a failure for Hidalgo the man, but a success in establishing a new myth containing a new set of paradigms, goals, and incentives for Mexican struggle."
4934,过程化分析以文化分析为前提，正如它同时也以结构一功能分析为前提一样，包含了更为静止的比较形态分析。,"Processual analysis assumes cultural analysis, just as it assumes structural-functional analysis, including more static comparative morphological analysis.It negates none of these, but puts dynamics first."
4934,过程化分析并没有忽视任何一种静态分析模式，而是更强调动态的重要性。,
4934,然而，在对事实进行陈述的时候也须按照一定的顺序来进行，因此以系统化的纲领的形式对制度化的社会结构赖以建构的规则进行陈述是一种非常有用的策略，同时，与这些规则相关的意义、强度以及变化形式也应置于不同的情况之下并尽可能使用数字或者统计资料进行量度，这一点同样有用。,"Yet in the order of presentation of facts it is a useful strategy to present a systematic outline of the principles on which the institutionalized social structure is constructed and to measure their relative importance, intensity, and variation under different circumstances with numerical or statistical data if possible."
4935,"阿诺尔德·范·根纳普在人类学的一本经典著作中分析了生命礼仪,这种仪式帮助个人度过他们生命中的重要关头，比如出生、青春期、结婚、为人父母、踏入史高阶层、职业专业化以及死亡。","In one of anthropology's classic works, Arnold Van Gennep analyzed the rites of passage that help individuals through the crucial crises of their lives, such as birth, puberty, marriage, parenthood, advancement to a higher class, occupational specialization, and death."
4935,他发现，将所有谊些为生命关口准备的典礼分三个阶段：分离（separation)、过渡（transition)和融入（incorporation)——是有用的。,"He found it useful to divide ceremonies for all of these life crises into three stages: separation, transition, and incorporation."
4935,个人首先会被仪式性地从社会整体中排除出去，然后隔离上一段时期，最后重新融入社会，获得其新地位。,"The individual first would be ritually removed from the society as a whole, then isolated for a period, and finally incorporated back into society in his or her new status."
4936,变迁的机制是创新、传播、文化遗失和涵化。,"The mechanisms of change are innovation, diffusion, cultural loss, and acculturation."
4936,如果社会中的某个人发现了某些新事物，后来这种新事物又被其他社会成员接受了，这就是发生了创新。,Innovation occurs when someone within a society discovers something new that is then accepted by other society members.
4936,传播是从另一个群体借用某些东西，而文化遗失则是对现存的习俗或特征的遗弃，不论有无替换。涵化是在殖民条件下因与外来文化密集和直接接触而发生的大范围变迁。,"Diffusion is the borrowing of something from another group, and cultural loss is the abandonment of an existing practice or trait, with or without replacement Acculturation is the massive change that comes about with the sort of intensive firsthand contact that has occurred under colonialism."
4937,在田野点，许多人类学家不知不觉中扮演了小丑的角色。,Many anthropologists involuntarily take on the role of the clown when in the field.
4937,他们可能用错误的语法说了奇怪的话，他们询问一些令人吃惊有时是不得体的问题，而且在事情应该怎么做的问题上倾向于打破一些规则。,"They may speak strangely with a flawed grammar; they ask surprising and sometimes tactless questions, and tend to break many rules regarding how things ought to be done."
4937,这样一个角色对于田野工作来说，可能是一个精彩的起始点，即使很少人这么干：通过发现当地人对某人自己的行为有怎样的反应，某人获得一个关于他们的思维方式的先期提示。,"Such a role can be an excellent starting-point for fieldwork, even if it is rarely chosen: through discovering how the locals react to one's own behaviour, one obtains an early hint about their way of thinking."
4938,"濡化是文化从一代人传递到下一代人的过程,通过这一过程，个人成为其社会的成员。",Enculturation is the process by which culture is passed from one generation to the next.
4938,从出生不久，当自我意识开始形成，即一个人开始能够感到自己是时间和空间中的一个对象并评价自己的行动时濡化就开始了。,"It begins soon after birth, as self-awareness—the ability to perceive oneself as an object in time and space and to judge one's actions—starts to develop."
4938,自我意识要发生作用，个人必须要有行为环境。,"For self-awareness to function, the individual must be provided with a behavioral environment."
4938,首先，个人学习有关不同于自我的客体世界的知识，而这些总是在他或她由以成长的文化所指定的范围内感知到的。,"First, one learns about a world of objects other than the self, and these always are perceived in terms the culture he or she grows up in specifies."
4939,与我居住的美国大学城的电话号码簿上列出的名单相比，英国牛津的电话号码簿上只列出了一小部分精神病医生和心理学家的名字，即使牛津要远远大于我所住的大学城。,"The telephone directory of Oxford, England, lists only a fraction of the number of psychiatrists and psychologists listed in the American university town where I live, even though Oxford is much larger."
4939,这一区别无疑反映出美国的心理学化，但是英美文化也有一个共同之处，即都注重控制激情。,"This difference doubtless reflects the psychologizing of America, but Anglo-American culture shares the emphasis on controlling passions."
4939,在美国有许多类型的控制心理学——从卡内基到行为矫正。,There are numerous American psychologies of control: from Dale Carnegie to behavior modification.
4940,施奈德的生平和他的理论转向则颇为不同。,Schneider's biography and theoretical twists were quite different.
4940,二战之前，他在耶鲁的人类关系学院开始他的研究生学习。人类关系学院是一个跨学科计划，这与它在哈佛和芝加哥相对应的院系类似，但在这里占主导的是行为主义。,"He began graduate work before World War II in the School of Human Relations at Yale, an interdisciplinary program like its counterparts at Harvard and Chicago but dominated by behaviorism."
4941,在缺乏有效控制生育办法的情况下，异性个人之间性活动的一般结果是，妇女迟早要怀孕。,"In the absence of effective birth-control devices, the usual outcome of sexual activity between individuals of opposite sex is that, sooner or later, the woman becomes pregnant."
4941,在纳亚尔人中，如女人怀孕，一些男人(他们可能是，也可能不是生物学意义上的父亲)就必须正式承认自己是父亲。,"When this happens among the Nayar, some man must formally acknowledge paternity, the third transaction."
4941,他通过送礼物给这个妇女和助产婆来承认自己是父亲，虽然他还会很关注这个孩子，但他没有进一步的义务，因为教育和供养孩子是这个孩子母亲兄弟们的责任，孩子与其母亲和他们住在一起。,"He does this by making gifts to the woman and the midwife.Though he may continue to take much interest in the child, he has no further obligations, for the child's education and support are the responsibility of the child mother's brothers, whom the child and its mother live with."
4941,这第三项事务确立了孩子的合法性。,This transaction establishes the child's legitimacy.
4942,在任何地方，在寻食以及在生产食物的地方，在非工业社会以及在工业社会，我们都吋以找到合作工作的群体。,Cooperative work groups can be found everywhere in nonliterate as well as literate and in non-industrial as well as industrial societies.
4942,如果努力做的事涉及整个社区，那么工作中通常就弥漫着一种喜庆的情结。,"Often, if the effort involves the whole community, a festive spirit permeates the work."
4942,"基库尤人部落的男子约摩·肯雅塔,他就学于英国教会学校，在剑桥大学研究人类学，并成为独立的肯尼亚的第一任总统，他描述了在其国家一天劳动后的欢乐时光：如果一个陌生人碰巧从这里经过，他肯定想不到，这些唱歌跳舞的人已完成了他们一天的工作。","Jomo Kenyatta, the anthropologist who later became a respected statesman and a father, of an independent Kenya, described the time of enjoyment after a day's labor in his country: If a stranger happens to pass by, he will have no idea that these people who are singing and dancing have completed their day work."
4942,这就是为什么大多数欧洲人会出现错谈的原因，他们没有认识到，非洲人在他自己的环境里并不以钟表的走动来计算时间或工作，而是以饱满的精神和热情去完成面前的工作。,"This is why most Europeans have erred by not realizing that the African in his own environment does not count hours or work by the movement of the clock, but works with good spirit and enthusiasm ro complete the tasks before him."
4943,与血缘家庭相反，夫妻家庭以丈夫与妻子的婚姻纽带为基础。,"Conjugal, as opposed to consanguine, families are formed on the basis of marital ties between husband and wife."
4943,夫妻家庭最低限度由已婚的夫妻及其扶养的孩子组成，又被称为核心家庭(nuclear family)；夫妻家庭的其他形式是一夫多妻制家庭和一妻多夫制家庭，这可被设想为有一个共同配偶的梭心家庭的集合。,"Minimally, a conjugal family consists of a married couple with their dependent children, otherwise known as the nuclear family; other forms of conjugal families are polygynous and polyandrous families, which may be thought of as aggregates of nuclear families with one spouse in common."
4943,"一夫多妻制家庭包括一个丈夫的多个妻子,而一妻多夫制家庭则包括一个妻子的多个丈夫。","A polygynous family includes the multiple wives of a single husband, while a polyandrous family includes the multiple husbands of a single wife."
4943,两种家庭经常列在多配偶制家庭的标题之下。,Both are often lumped together under the heading of polygamous families.
4944,与血缘家庭相反，夫妻家庭以丈夫与妻子的婚姻纽带为基础。,"Conjugal, as opposed to consanguine, families are formed on the basis of marital ties between husband and wife."
4944,夫妻家庭最低限度由已婚的夫妻及其扶养的孩子组成，又被称为核心家庭（nuclear family）；夫妻家庭的其他形式是一夫多妻制家庭和一妻多夫制家庭，这可被设想为有一个共同配偶的核心家庭的集合。,"Minimally, a conjugal family consists of a married couple with their dependent children, otherwise known as the nuclear family; other forms of conjugal families are polygynous and polyandrous families, which may be thought of as aggregates of nuclear families with one spouse in common."
4944,一夫多妻制家庭包括一个丈夫的多个妻子，而一妻多夫制 家庭则包括一个妻子的多个丈夫。,"A polygynous family includes the multiple wives of a single husband, while a polyandrous family includes the multiple husbands of a single wife."
4944,两种家庭经常列在多配偶制家庭的标题之下。,Both are often lumped together under the heading of polygamous families.
4945,对国民性格的替代性研究——考虑到并非所有人格都与文化理想相一致——是人类学家许烺光的研究。,An alternative approach to national character —one that allows for the fact not all personalities conform to cultural ideals—is that of anthropologist Francis Hsu.
4945,他的研究方式是研究一个国家文化的核心价值(core value)以及相关的人格特征。,His approach was to study the core values of a country's culture and related personality traits.
4945,他表明，中国人特别看重亲属关系，合作高于其他一切。,"The Chinese, he suggested, value kin ties and cooperation above all else."
4945,对他们来说，相互依存是个人关系的真正本质，而且已延续数千年了。,"To them, mutual dependence is the very essence of personal relationships and has been for thousands of years."
4945,顺从和使自己的意愿服从家族和亲属胜于其他一切，自力更生既得不到提倡也不是引为骄傲的本钱。,"Compliance and subordination of one's will to that of family and kin transcends all else, while self-reliance is neither promoted nor a source of pride."
4946,我列举一个极端的例子。,"I shall give just one, admittedly extreme, example."
4946,1989年南非种族隔离解除以前，黑人、白人、有色人和亚洲人是彼此分离的。同时黑人又被再分成不同的族体：祖鲁人（Zulu)、茨瓦纳人（Tswa-na)、科萨人（Xhosa)等等。,"Until the end of legal apartheid in South Africa in 1989, blacks, whites, coloureds and Asians were legally separated from one another, while the black section of the population was subdivided into ethnicities – Zulu, Tswana, Xhosa etc."
4947,分界线可能在心理、地理、社会或经济的方面，而这些方面往往不是很清楚。,"Boundaries may be psychological, geographic, social, or economic, and they are not always very clear."
4947,就地区方言来说，经常有过渡地带，或可能是缓冲地带，就如在中国的中部与南部之间的地带，在那里可以找到并理解两种方言的各种特点。,"Re-gional dialects frequently have a transitional territory, or perhaps a buffer zone, where features of both are found and understood, as between central and southern China."
4947,事实在于，如果你学会北京话，那么你不可能与来自广东或香港的某人交流，尽管两种语言——或方言——按惯例被称为汉语。,"But if you learn the Chinese of Beijing, you cannot communicate with someone who comes from Canton or Hong Kong, although both languages—or dialects—are conventionally called Chinese."
4947,在单个社会内部使一个群体可能与另一个群体区别开来的一个经典例子，是许多市中心非洲裔美国人所说的语言。,A classic example of the kind of dialect that may set one group apart from others within a single society is one spoken by many inner-city African Americans.
4947,技术上称之为“美国黑人方言英语”，人们经常称它为“黑人英语”，而（最近）称之为“黑人语（Ebonics）”。,"Technically known as African American Vernacular English, it often has been referred to as Black English and (more recently) as Ebonics."
4948,生活在热带区域的人们常让蜂蜜引路鸟（honey guide bird）引导他们寻找野生蜜蜂的巢穴，鸟儿反过来也受益于人类提炼蜂蜜的能力。,"Human beings in tropical regions allow the honey guide bird to show them the way to wild bees' nests, and the bird in turn benefits from the human beings' ability to extract the honey."
4948,一只被工作人员教会了美国手势语的大猩猩（Gardner等 1989）也会将其所学的知识传递给它的伙伴（Fouts等 1989）。,Chimpanzees have been taught American Sign Language (Gardner et al. 1989) and have then taught it to each other (Fouts et al. 1989).
4948,我建议我们放弃任何声称文化是人类独一无二特性的企图，借此假装人类是“不同”的，并以这种方式将人类与其他动物截然分开。,"I suggest that we abandon any attempt to claim culture as a uniquely human characteristic, and with it the pretence that human beings are ""different"" in a way that sets them significantly apart from the rest of the animal kingdom."
4948,就任何物种都不同于其他物种而言，以自己的方式生存于世，并以自己特有的方式影响世界而言，人类是独特的。,"Human beings are different in the sense that any species is different from the rest, in having its own way of living in the world and its own distinctive impact on the world."
4949,在牛津，人类学是在几个背景下被教导的。,"At Oxford, anthropology is taught in several settings."
4949,一 ，大学博物馆和皮特河博物馆的史前史和民俗学部门，教导一个宏观视角，主要强调事实。,"One, the Department of Prehistory and Ethnology at the University Museum and Pitt-Rivers Museum, teaches a brand of anthropology reflected in the museums: a macro view, emphasizing material factors."
4949,二，社会人类学研究所，教导社会人类学。,"Another, the Institute of Social Anthropology, teaches social anthropology."
4949,这一研究所没有博物馆，它的布局也与后者有所不同。,This institute has no museum; its layout is different.
4949,社会人类学研究所在底层有一个普通的房间——一个相当破旧但却非常舒适的聊天和喝咖啡的地方，墙上贴着许多著名社会人类学家的照片。,"The Institute of Social Anthropology has a common room on the ground floor – a rather shabby but pleasant setting for coffee and conversation, overseen by photographs of notable social anthropologists displayed on a wall."
4950,即使是一直持续着的构建宏观视野的努力也已融进了微观描述和解释的因素。,Even continuing efforts to build macro perspectives are infused with concerns about matters of micro description and interpretation.
4950,在政治经济学领域——这一领域可视为是用最切合于西方的官场和国家管理技术的术语来对世界局势所作的连续解说一一建立宏大体系的努力方面，最近一项重大创新是伊曼纽尔˙沃勒斯坦（Immanuel Wallerstein）1970年代早期提出的世界体系视角。,"In the field of political economy, which can be seen as a continuing commentary upon world conditions in terms most relevant to Western officialdom and statecraft, the major recent innovation in efforts at macro system building has been the world-system perspective introduced by Immanuel Wallerstein during the early 1970s."
4950,沃勒斯坦的有关中心-边缘体系的论述以及他对历史的总括性解释是否恰当，已成为各种激烈争论的焦点，并富有意味地取决于对地方状况的讨论。,"The adequacy of Wallerstein's center-periphery formulation and his overview interpretations of history are the subject of lively debate, dependent significantly on discussions of local situations."
4951,可是，文化相对主义则走得更远，成为一种彻底的反人文主义的批判，近来打着“结构主义”和“后结构主义”的旗号得以体现。,"Cultural relativism can be taken much further, however, and become a thoroughgoing anti-humanistic critique, as has recently transpired under the monikers of ""structuralism"" and ""post structuralism""."
4951,如果意识的形式与内容并不优先于它所处的文化的象征话语和社会实践的话，那么不仅人、个体这些身份认同要从属于文化中心（可能依旧是无意识的），而且整个人类思想、人文主义和人的尊严等等都是历史暂时性的文化产品：例如种族中心主义、神话、技术。,"If consciousness, its form and content, are not prior to the symbolic discourses and social practices in which it is culturally embedded, then not only is identity—human, individual, whatever—subordinate to cultural matrices (which may remain unconscious), but the whole idea of humankind, humanism, human dignity, and so on, is a historically contingent cultural product: ethnocentric, mythical, teleological."
4951,福柯说：“人不过是近期的一个发明，一个存在了不到两百年的形象”（Foucault l972:115)。,"""Man"", as Foucault put it, ""is only a recent invention, a figure not yet two centuries old"".(1972:115)."
4952,人类学理论中第三类较大的理论观点可以被称为互动观点。,A third large grouping of anthropological theories is what might be termed the interactive perspective.
4952,这个理论观点更确切说是一组同时包含了历时和共 时两方面的理论。,
4952,,"This perspective or, more accurately, set of perspectives, has both diachronic and synchronic aspects."
4952,"该理论追随者拒绝大部分共时分析的静态特性,也拒绝古典进化论和传播论传统中的简单历史假设。","Its adherents reject the static nature of most synchronic analysis, and reject also the simplistic historical assumptions of the classical evolutionist and diffusionist traditions."
4953,也许墨西哥裔美国人写作的最引人瞩目的特征是跨语言游戏：互扰 （interference）、交替使用、交互参照；这些东西其他族群写作中也有，但墨西哥裔美国人将其发挥到最清晰和最戏剧化的水平。,"Perhaps the most striking feature of Mexican-American writing, present in other ethnic writing too, but brought to its most explicit and dramatic level here, is interlinguistic play: interference, alternation, inter-reference."
4953,这也是前面所引的第一首亚美尼亚诗歌的主题。,This was the subject of the first Armenian poem cited above.
4953,它在黑人英语构成的文本中表现得很明显。,It is clear in the texture of black English.
4953,一些墨西哥裔美国作家使用西班牙语，另一些使用英语，还有一些在不同页或不同章中交替/对照使用西班牙语和英语（相互翻译）。,"Some Mexican-American writers use Spanish, others English, some have alternating/ mirroring pages or chapters of Spanish and English (reciprocal translations)."
4953,奇卡诺人（Chicano）文学杂志坚决地使用双语。,"Chicano literary journals (El Grito, Entrelinas, Revista Chicano-Riquena) are resolutely bilingual."
4953,英语语流中会出现西班牙语短语，西班牙语的词汇和语法结构也受到英语的影响而变化。,"Spanish phrases occur within the flow of English, and Spanish words and grammatical structure take on changes influenced by English."
4953,实际上，对某些波丘语 （pochismo）或卡委语（calo）来说，奇卡诺俚语具有优越地位。,"Indeed, for some pochismo or calo, the Chicano slang, takes on a privileged role."
4954,两个基本要素对这样做是不可或缺的：想象力和怀疑态度。,Two basic ingredients are essential for this: imagination and skepticism.
4954,想象力虽然可能使我们误入歧路，但是，为了我们能认识现象可能被排列的意外方式，能以新方式思考旧事物，它是必须的。,"Imagination, though capable of leading us astray, is required for imagining the ways phenomena might be ordered and for thinking of old things in new ways."
4954,没有想象力，就不可能有科学。,"Without it, science cannot exist."
4954,怀疑态度使我们能够区分事实（fact）与幻想，检验我们的思辨能力，防止我们失去想象力。,"Skepticism is what allows us to distinguish fact from fancy, to test our speculations, and to prevent our imaginations from running away with us."
4955,由于世界饥荒的同时存在，源自污染的结构性暴力在世界上较贫穷国家是很严重的，因为这些国家仍在广泛使用在诸如美国这样的国家禁止使用的化学药剂。,"As with world hunger, the structural violence from pollution tends to be greatest in the poorest countries of the world, where chemicals banned in countries such as the United States are still widely used."
4955,并且，工业国家利用“不发达”国家松懈的环境法规来处理有危害的废弃物。例如，贝宁总统在年以前与一个欧洲废品公司签了一项合同，同意后者将有毒的和低放射性的废弃物倾倒在其政治对手的土地上。,"Moreover, industrial countries have taken advantage of the lax environmental regulations of instance, the president of Benin (in West Africa) not long ago signed a contract with a European waste company to dump toxic and low-grade radioactive waste on the lands of his political opposition."
4955,在美国，政府和工业界双双劝说保留区中正经历严重经济衰退的印第安人，要他们相信，其问题的解决办法，就在于允许政府和工业界在他们的土地上处理梭废物和其他的有害废弃物。,"In the United States, both government and industry have tried to persuade Indians on reservations experiencing severe economic depression that the solution to their problems lies in allowing disposal of nuclear and other hazardous waste on their lands."
4956,按照这一公式，文学与虚构的话语与生俱来是不稳定的；它“在意义的分层上大做文章；它意在言外；它以那样-种语言描绘自己，从中它不断取得的效果就是其意义不可能被框定或控制”（de Certeau 19S3:128）。,"In this schema, the discourse of literature and fiction is inherently unstable; it ""plays on the stratification of meaning; it narrates one thing in order to tell something else; it delineates itself in a language from which it continuously draws effects of meaning that cannot be circumscribed or checked"" (1983: 128)."
4956,这一话语不可救药地是比喻性的和多义的，它不断地被从科学中驱逐出去，但并非总是很成功。,"This discourse, repeatedly banished from science, but with uneven success, is incurably figurative and polysemous."
4956,（只要它的效果开始过于公开地被感觉到，一个科学文本就显得太“文学”了，比如说，似乎用了太多的隐喻，似乎依赖风格和形象描绘，等等。）,"(Whenever its effects begin to be felt too openly, a scientific text will appear ""literary""; it will seem to be using too many metaphors, to be relying on style, evocation, and so on . )"
4957,绘画艺术既可以被看成是具象的，也可以被看成是抽象的，而实际上，送些类别只是代表一个连续变化体的两极。,"Pictorial art may be regarded as either representational or abstract, though in truth these categories represent polar ends of a continuum."
4957,非洲南部的岩石艺术说明了研究艺术可采用的三种研究方式。,The rock art of southern Africa illustrates three ways the study of art may be approached.
4957,美学的和叙事的研究方式集中关注事物怎样得到描绘，以及什么事物得到描绘。,The aesthetic and narrative approaches focus on how and what things are depicted.
4957,它们本身很少揭示艺术究竟是什么，并可能表达出有关创造该艺术的民族的歪曲看法。,By themselves they reveal little about what the art is all about and may convey a distorted view of the people responsible for it.
4957,只有阐释的研究方式能够揭示另一个民族艺术的意义。,Only the interpretive approach can reveal the meaning of another peopled art.
4957,这种研究方式需要借用丰富的民族志和其他各祌可靠的资料。,This approach requires drawing on a rich body of ethnography and often other sets of data.
4957,这样的努力是值得的，因为它可能证明，这种艺术远比人们可能预料的要复杂得多。,"The effort is worthwhile, as it may reveal the art to be far more complex than one might otherwise expect."
4957,将这种研究方式应用于非洲南部的岩石艺术，我们看到，当殖民主义者侵入布须曼人地区时，绘画和雕刻实际上怎样成为布须曼人解决变化中的权力关系的那种战略的组成部分。,"Applied to southern African rock art, it shows, among other aspects of the culture, how paintings and engravings were actually part of Bushman strategy for negotiating changing power relations as colonists invaded their lands."
4958,为什么与性别相关的材料要整合起来？,
4958,文化人类学本身是整合的学科；围绕性别的概念和问题往往太复杂了，以至于不能从其上下文中去掉，而且，在所有各章安排这种材料在于强调，对性別的看法如何成为人们所做的任何事情的一部分。,
4958,第十版的大部分新内容（在下面列出）以某种方式与性别相关。,Much of the new content for the ninth edition (listed below) relates to gender in some way.
4958,这些变化一般至少属于下述三个范畴之一：学科内关于性别的思想变化；在特殊社会或文化中，在性别方面有重要分歧的实例；以及关于性别和性別关系的跨文化含义。,"These changes generally fall into at least one of three categories: changes in thinking about gender within the discipline, examples that have important ramifications on gender in a particular society or culture, and cross-cultural implications about gender and gender relations."
4958,新素材的实例包括：对同性恋身份和同性婚姻的讨论，有关类人猿社会雌性角色的当前思考，以及关于女性割阴的最近新闻。,Examples of new material range from an expanded definition of marriage and additional material on homosexual identity to current thinking on the role of Hadza women in food provisioning and recent news in regard to female genital mutilation.
4958,通过这样有稳定节奏的叙述，第十版避免使性别 “集中于”前后无呼应的单独章节内。,"Through a steady drumbeat of such coverage, the ninth edition avoids a thunderous crash of relegating ugenderw to a single chapter that is preceded and followed by silence."
4959,梅拉索克斯认为，由于两性劳动分工情况本身就会导致社会政治对女性的压制，从而使“女人成为男人的仆人（或奴隶）”（Meillassoux 1981: 21）。,"Meillassoux argues that it was the formation of the sexual division of labour, itself, that led to the socio-political subjugation of women, and thus made ‘the woman (or slave) a servant of men’ (Meillassoux 1981:21)."
4959,亲属制度对此负有责任，因为正是通过亲属制度的发展，才实现了对女人的压制。,"Kinship institutions are the culprit, for it was through their development that the subjugation of women was achieved."
4959,婚姻、联姻和父系制度都是男人用来控制和约束女人的手段。,"Marriage, conjugality and paternal filiation, all were imposed upon women by men to be the means through which men could constrain women."
4960,人类地理学方法不能解释人们所观察到的事物真相，这一点在早些时候就已经证实。,It became clear at an early stage that the anthropogeographic approach could not account for observed realities.
4960,文化之所以会出现类聚现象是因为它们具有相同的地理类型以及若干看似重要的相同特征。,Cultures were grouped together on the grounds that they occupied the same type of habitat and shared a few seemingly significant features.
4960,而某些深深扎根于人类学家头脑中的文化特征，如亲属制度与称谓、婚姻规则及政治体制等，在不同的地理区域内有着显著的差异性。,"And yet some of the cultural characteristics which most occupied anthropologists’ minds, such as kinship terminologies, marriage rules and political systems, varied quite markedly within geographical areas."
4960,很明显，不管环境如何影响这些既定的规则，它们并不直接构成因果关系。,"It appeared that, whatever the effects of the environment on such institutions, they were not directly causal."
4960,在英国，受杜尔凯姆（Durkheim) (1964[1895])、拉德克利夫一布朗及马林诺夫斯基等人的影响，人类学家将注意力转向了文化制度的社会功能方面，而不是生态方面的研究。,"In Britain, following the influence of Durkheim (1964 [1895]), Radcliffe-Brown and Malinowski, anthropologists responded by turning their attention to the social, rather than the ecological, functions of cultural institutions."
4961,不过威利斯确实是摆出了一副挑战人类学民族志传统的姿态，后者或许是以一种不能按字面意义理解的、不可能达到的整体主义理想为基础的，而威利斯要将民族志应用于具有更为广阔的目标和理论意味的工程，如他自己所做的那样。,"Nonetheless, Willis does pose the challenge for the anthropological tradition of ethnography, underlain perhaps by an unattainable ideal of holism not to be taken literally, to apply ethnography to projects of broader purpose and theoretical significance, like his own."
4961,这就需要一种混合体裁文本（mixed-genre texts）的写作，类似于雷蒙德˙威廉斯所设想的社会现实主义的文本，民族志的再现和权威是其中的组成部分、其在文本中的地位则可不一而足。,"This entails the writing of mixed - genre texts, similar to those envisioned by Raymond Williams for social realism, in which e thnographic representation and authority would be a variably salient component."
4961,与威利斯所认为的人类学民族志已过时的看法相反，这种混合体裁的文本对对象的内在生活和历史政治经济学世界的本质都保持着敏感，这类文本是我们一直在讨论的当代人类学实验潮流的一个重要方面。,"Contrary to Willis's outmoded perception of the state of ethnography within anthropology, such mixed-genre texts, sensitive to both the inner lives of subjects and the nature of world historical political economy, are a major concern of the trend of experimentation in contemporary anthropology that we have been discussing."
4962,“精神一肉体”的问题与活力论同机械论的争论有关。,"The ""Mind-Body"" problem is of one piece with the Vitalism-Mechanism controversy."
4962,从来没有人能“证明”活力论是错误的，但科学家和许多哲学家们都认为，应把活力论当作陈腐的、畸形的尤其是贫瘠的理论加以否定的时刻已经来临。,"No one has ever ""disproved"" the theory of Vitalism, but scientists, and many philosophers, are agreed that the time has come when it should be ignored as obsolete, outgrown and, above all, sterile."
4962,这并不是说，机械论哲学就是真理（即是大写字母的“真理”），而活力论哲学则是谬误；而是说机械论一向是富于成效的。,"It is not that the philosophy of Mechanism is True (with a capital T) and that of Vitalism False.It is that Mechanism has been fruitful, productive; Vitalism barren and sterile."
4962,活力论则是不结果实的花朵。纽曼（H˙H˙Newman）教授宣称：活力论“作为一种理论观点，与那些导致已经取得的全部科学进步的观点正相对立。”,"Vitalism as ""a view is exactly opposite to those which have led to all the scientific piogTcss that has been made,"" declares Professor H. H. Newman."
4963,伯尔德建议用 “procurement”（获得）这个词来描述狩猎一采集民与他们环境之间的关系： 动词“procure”（根据《牛津简明辞典》）是指“致使、用心或费力获得、说服、劝诱或说服某人去做某事名，“Procurement”。,"Bird-David suggested the term ""procurement"" to describe the relationship between huntergatherers and their environment: ""to procure"" (according to the Shorter Oxford Dictionary) is ""to bring about, to obtain by care or effort, to prevail upon, to induce, to persuade a person to do something""."
4963,是指经营、发明、获得、得到、 收入之意。,"""Procurement"" is management, contrivance, acquisition, getting, gaining."
4963,这两个词都能准确地描述那些富有关心、经验和知识的现代狩猎一采集民；他们的活动涉猎采集大自然所提供的丰富资源，他们为获取资源而说服自然、维护自然（1992b:40)。,"Both terms are accurate enough for describing modern hunter-gatherers who apply care, sophistication and knowledge; whose activities range from collecting what the environment gives to prevailing upon it, persuading it and managing it in order to get resources."
4964,最强烈地关注这类社会生活的人类学分支就是社会人类学，它的灵感可以一直追溯到许多人，尤其是前面特别提到的法国社会哲学家涂尔干。,"The branch of anthropology most intensely focused on this kind of social life is known as social anthropology, and it traces its inspiration especially to the French social philosopher mentioned earlier, Emile Durkheim."
4964,这方面的一个重要来源是涂尔干1893年发表的博士论文，《社会劳动分工论》，在这篇论文中他指出了“机械团结”与“有机团结”之间的区别。,"An important source was Durkheim's doctoral dissertation, The Division of Labor in Society, in which he set forth the distinction between ""mechanical"" and ""organic"" solidarity."
4964,有机团结描述的是像我们自己的当代、都市化的社会。,"Organic solidarity characterizes contemporary, urbanized society like our own."
4965,这样的顺序共有十一项，每一项都由一种“冲动”、 一种伴随的生理“行为”以及一种从行为中获得的“满足”组成。,"There are eleven of these sequences, each composed of an ‘impulse’, an associated physiological ‘act’, and a ‘satisfaction’ which results from that act."
4965,例如，困倦的冲动伴随着睡觉这一行为，并导致“恢复能量的醒来”这样的满足 (Malinowski 1944 : 77 ) 。,"For example, the impulse of somnolence is associated with the act of sleep, resulting in satisfaction by ‘awakening with restored energy’ (1944: 77)."
4965,他随后又将这个十一项的范式略微简化。,He follows this eleven-fold paradigm with a slightly simpler one.
4965,这是一个建立在七项“基本需求”和各自对应的“文化反应”之间关系之上的范式 (Malinowski 1944 : 91 - 119 ),This is the one built on the relationship between seven ‘basic needs’ and their respective ‘cultural responses’ (1944: 91– 119).
4966,这类经验其实也就是人类学家尼达姆（Rodney Needham)举例说明“信仰”并不是一个描述多数宗教体验合适的术语时所暗示的。,"This sort of experience is what anthropologist Rodney Needham implies when he demonstrates that ""belief"" is not a suitable term for describing much of religious experience."
4966,实际上，信仰最适合起源于近东有着独特经典和神学传统的宗教——像犹太教、伊斯兰教和基督教。,"Belief, in fact, best suits those peculiarly textual and theological traditions of Near Eastern origin – Judaism, Islam, and Christianity."
4966,信仰就是主张：我相信有上帝；我相信有天堂。,A belief is a proposition: I believe there is a God; I believe there is a heaven.
4966,但是，人类与宗教/魂灵之间的联系要比这更深、更复杂。,The relation of humans to the spiritual is deeper and more complex than this.
4967,20世纪社会文化人类学的大趋向却突出“教养的”多过“天生的”，强调的是，在不同的环境下，通过我们共同的天生器官所创造的千变万化。,"The general trend in twentieth-century social and cultural anthropology has nevertheless been to emphasise ""nurture"" over ""nature"", to stress the enormous variations generated, under differing circumstances, by our shared inborn apparatus."
4967,右下格描述的是可从生物性角度进行区分的人种之间的差异。,The bottom right field depicts differences between humans which can be accounted for biologically.
4967,直到1930年代或1940年代，人们才普遍认识到在不同人群之间存在着重要的基因差别，即“人种差别”，这可以用来解释某些文化变化。,"Until the 1930s or 1940s, it was commonly held that there are important genetic differences between human populations, that is ""racial differences"", which account for some cultural variation."
4967,但是，有资料表明，世界上的基因差异只有很微小的比例与我们习惯上认为的人种差别有关（Cavalli-Sforza et al 1994）。,"However, it has been shown that only a tiny proportion of the genetic variation in the world is related to what is conventionally thought of as racial variations (Cavalli-Sforza et al. 1994)."
4968,哈里斯（Harris 1979: 119-40)批评社会生物学是生物简化论。,Harris (1979: 119–40) attacked sociobiology as biological reductionism.
4968,他采用生物学家自己的术语，指出“基因类型从不能解释显性行为的所有多样性”（Harris 1979: 121)，甚至在简单有机体中，习得性行为也是一个要素。,"Taking on the biologists in their own terms, he pointed out that ‘genotypes never account for all the variations in behavioural phenotype’ (1979: 121): even in simple organisms, learned behaviour is a factor."
4968,按照哈里斯的说法，文化是“自由基因”（gene free)。,"Culture, as he says, is ‘gene free’."
4969,从人类起源的时间到大约一万年前近东与亚洲第一个国家建立，人类生活在地球上一些小的地域范围。,"From the time of human origins to the first states in the Near East and Asia some 10,000 years ago, humans lived in small bands."
4969,即使在第一个国家出现以后，大多数人仍然过着集体生活，政府、共同体和亲属关系都排在个体前面。,"Even after the first states were organized, most of life was lived collectively, with government, community, and kinship having priority over the individual."
4969,像我们现今所了解的“个体”概念，是宗教改革、文艺复兴和工业革命的一个产物，其真正存在只有几百年时间。即便如此，它也仅局限在西欧和它的殖民地。,"The concept of the individual as we know it really came to exist only a few hundred years ago, as a product of the Reformation, Renaissance, and industrial revolution, and even then it was confined to Western Europe and its colonies."
4969,在人类历史上，集体主义比个体主义占有更大的位置。,Collectivism has a larger place in human history than individualism.
4970,经济体制是物品生产、分配和消费的手段。,"An economic system is a means of producing, distributing, and consuming goods."
4970,研究无文字、非工业社会的经济只有在每个社会的整体文化背景中才能进行。,"Studying the economics of nonliterate, nonindustrial societies can be undertaken only in the context of the total culture of each society."
4970,每个社会都按其自己的原则配置原料、土地、劳动和技术，并分配物品，解决生存问题。,"Each society solves the problem of subsisting by allocating raw materials, land, labor, and technology and by distributing goods according to its own priorities."
4971,阔特格如夫的第二种观点和欧里奥旦（O’Riordan)的观点类似，认为环境决定论者有“技术中心论”和“生态中心论”之分 (O’Riordan 1981/1076:1—19)。,"Cotgrove's second formulation is similar to O'Riordan's distinction between the ""technocentric"" and ""ecocentric"" forms of environmentalism (O'Riordan 1981 [1976]:1–19)."
4971,技术中心论者坚信技术而且假设人类掌握着主动权，他们甚至希望通过改变政策和实践来营造一个环境更加和谐的工业社会，但他们并不质疑工业发展的目标，也不怀疑追逐工业发展的价值观念，他们因此走向环境决定论的保守派。生态中心论认为人类应该臣服于自然而 不是去控制自然。他们宣传对自然界应采取人性化的态度，应该尊重自然过程和自然物。这种观念的实践意义包括低影响的技术和一种自我依赖，如果不对工业社会的根基进行彻底的革新，这种理念便没有任何现实意义。,"Technocentrists have faith in technology and assume that humankind is in control.They may wish to make industrial society more environmentally benign, through changes in policy and practice, but they do not question the goals of industrial development, nor the values which drive it; they thus represent a conservative form of environmentalism."
4972,为寻找较好的畜牧草地，巴赫蒂亚里人的畜牧生活围绕两个季节性的迁移转变。,The pastoral life of the Bakhtiari revolves around two seasonal migrations to find better grazing lands for the flocks.
4972,每年人们都要迁移两次:秋天，从他们在山区的夏季营地迁走；春天，从他们在低地的冬季营房迁出。,Twice a year the people move: in the fall from their summer quarters in the mountains and in the spring from their winter quarters in the Jowlands.
4972,这种严格的季节性迁移模式通常被称为季节性牲畜迁移 (transhumance)。,This patcern of strict seasonal movement is known as transhumance.
4973,相反，在“法律的”领域，继嗣和世系群的规则规范着成员资格并提供了统治和隶属的法律主干，和睦和家族之间平常基本上是不相关的。,"In contrast, within the ‘jural’ domain the everyday relations of amity and filiation were for the most part irrelevant, for the principles of descent and lineage ruled its membership and provided the backbone for its jural structures of dominance and subordination."
4973,法律领域包含了政治并为社会提供了秩序和持续性的保障。,It was the jural domain that comprised the polity and thus provided society with its order and continuity.
4973,“原始”民族就是靠亲属关系政治（包括“法人继嗣群”）的命令和规范来统治和约束的。,The prescriptions and regulations of the kinship polity (comprising its ‘corporate descent groups’) were what ruled and constrained ‘primitive’ people.
4973,一个人在社会中的地位、权利和义务本质上都取决于他在其诞生的继嗣群中的位置。,"A man’s status, rights and obligations within society were in essence provided by his place within the lineage of his birth."
4974,特罗布里恩德群岛的居民就是采取这种居处模式，在那里，每一个个体生来就是一个亲属群体的成员，这些亲属通过他们的母亲，他们母亲的母亲，以此类推，直到最初那个衍生出所有后代的女性，来追溯他们的祖先。,"Such is the case among the people of the Trobriand Islands, where each individual is a member from birth of a group of relatives who trace their descent back through their mother, their mother's mother，and so on to the one woman all others are descended from."
4974,每一个继嗣群体都拥有财产，包括小村落、灌木丛和林地，有时候还有海滩，群体中的每一个成员对它们都有享用权。,"Each of these descent groups holds property, consisting of hamlet sites, bush and garden lands, and, in some cases, beachfronts members have access rights to."
4974,这些财产每一代由一名男性首领或其他男性头领控制，他继承了这些权利和义务，但因为继嗣只通过女性追溯，所以一个男性无法从他的父亲那里继承这些东西。,"These properties are controlled each generation by a male chief or other leader who inherits these rights and obligations, but because descent is traced exclusively through women, a man cannot inherit these from his father."
4975,尽管大多数考古学家专门研究人类的过去，但其中有些考古学家涉及当代背景中的物质对象的研究。,"Although archaeologists have concentrated on the human past, significant numbers of them are concerned with the study of material objects in contemporary settings."
4975,一个实例是亚里桑那州立大学的“垃圾调研项目”对家庭废弃物小心谨慎加以控制的研究，不断形成有关当代社会问题的信息。,"One example is the University of Arizona's Garbage Project, which, by a carefully controlled study of household waste, continues to produce information about contemporary social issues."
4975,除了它的成就之外，该调研项目还检验了访谈调查技术的有效性，社会学家、经济学家、其他社会科学家和政策制定者，为其数据的缘故，都极为依赖这一调査技术。,"One aim of this project has been to test the validity of interview-survey techniques, which sociologists, economists, other social scientists, and policymakers rely heavily on for their data."
4976,纽约市最初的犹太人继嗣群体是家庭圈。,The original Jewish descent groups in New York City are known as family circles.
4976,一个家庭圈的潜在成员由同一对袓先的所有活着的后代及其配偶组成。,"The potential members of a family circle consist of all living descendants, with their spouses, of an ancestral pair."
4976,实际上，并非所有有资格的人都会加入这个圈子，因此就有某种自由选择的因素。,"In actuality, not all who are eligible actually join, so an element of voluntarism exists."
4976,但资格很明确是由血统决定的，包括男女双方的亲属纽带，没有性别上的主次之分这是为了同时与祖先夫妇确立联系。,"But eligibility is explicitly determined by descent, using both male and female links, without set order, to establish the connection with the ancestral pair."
4976,这样，个体有资格加入的群体或“圈”通常便不止—个。,"Thus, individuals are normally eligible for membership in more than one group or ""circle""."
4977,虽然民族志的田野工作是民族学的基础，但它不是民族学家的唯一工作。,"Although ethnographic fieldwork is basic to ethnology, it is not the sole occupation of the ethnologist."
4977,民族志的性质大致是描述性的，它为（有较多理论志向的）良族学家提供基础数据，然后民族学家就可能利用这些数据，通过把一种文化的某个特殊方面与其他文化中的相同方面做比较而对它加以研究。,"Largely descriptive in nature, ethnography provides the basic data the ethnologist (who is more theoretically oriented) then may use to study one particular aspect of a culture by comparing it with that same aspect in others."
4977,人类学家始终如一地做这种跨文化比较，这也是该学科的另一个标志。,"Anthropologists constantly make such cross-cultural comparisons, and this is another hallmark of the discipline."
4977,当你比较人们从事于北美人视为“家务”的时间，通过跨文化比较就可能产生对你自己的信念和实践的令人感兴趣的深刻见解。,"Interesting insights into our own practices may come from cross-cultural comparisons, as when one compares the time people devote to what we consider housework."
4978,他们被分成许多异族结婚的宗族（也就是有一个共同祖先的团体），并且被要求与和自己所在的家系祖先不同的人结婚。,"They are divided into a number of exogamous clans (named groups with a common ancestor), and are required to marry persons who do not trace their genealogy to the same ancestor as they do."
4978,因为他们是根据男性血脉（父系）计算家族的，你的父亲的姐妹的孩子和母亲的兄弟的姐妹都不属于你自己的宗族（他们是跨堂表亲的），因此他们都被归类为是可以与之结婚的。,"Since they reckon kinship along the male line (patrilineality), father's sister's children and mother's brother's sister do not belong to one's own clan (they are cross-cousins) and are thus classified as marriageable."
4978,在许多中东人那里，却相反，与父亲的兄弟的孩子结婚（平行的堂兄弟姐妹）相当普遍。,"Among many Middle Eastern peoples, on the contrary, marriage with father's brother's child (one's parallel cousin) is widely practised."
4978,某种程度上，所有的人类群体都既是同族婚配的，又是异族婚配的，只是程度不同：你被指望与一个“自己的同类”结婚，但却不是某个被归类为你的近亲的人。,"In a sense, all human groups are both endogamous and exogamous to varying degrees: one is expected to marry ""one's own kind"", but not someone classified as a close relative."
4979,换句话说，关于区分高级种姓和低级种姓的价值观和标准，似乎已达成了普遍的共识。,"There seems, in other words, to be widespread agreement concerning values and criteria for distinguishing a low caste from a high one."
4979,在印度乡村，传统的以迦提为基础的劳动分工被称为贾吉摩尼（jajmani）制度。,The traditional jãti-based division of labour in Indian villages is called the jajmani system.
4979,它由一整套惯例构成，规定了不同种姓成员之间的产品交换和服务。,It consists of a set of traditional rules about the exchange of products and services between the members of different castes.
4979,也就是说，每个种姓对其他种姓都具有特定的义务。,"In other words, each caste has specific commitments towards the others."
4979,从全局来看看，幸亏有了不同种姓之间的相互依赖，整个村子才能被维持成一个社会系统；从参与者的角度看，你可以说，它创造意义重大的对于个人机会的结构性约束。,"Seen from a systemic perspective, one may say that the village is upheld as a social system thanks to the interdependence between the castes; seen from an actor perspective, one may say that it creates significant structural constraints on individual opportunities."
4980,一个重要区别就在程序上。,An important difference concerns procedure.
4980,在实证主义模型中，系统观察或实验导致对假说和普遍定律公式化的检验。,"In the positivist model, systematic observation or experiment leads to tests of hypotheses and formulation of general laws."
4980,反过来，定律则归类并进而解释具体现象，像观察及实验的结果。,"Laws, in turn, subsume and thus explain specific phenomena such as the results of the observations and experiments."
4980,这类模型被称作“假设一推理”；实验则检验从法则或理论推论出的假设。,"This kind of model is known as ""hypothetico-deductive""; an experiment tests a hypothesis that is deduced from a law or theory."
4981,从20世纪70年代以来，这在一些研究结果中产生了一些张力。,This produced some tension in the research findings from the 1970s.
4981,尽管那一时期的性别研究学者拥有一种很强的意识，即男性占据主导地位是错误的，但这与他们的文化相对主义的感觉则相互冲突。,"Although the scholars of gender during that period operated with a strong sense that male domination was wrong, this conflicted with their sense of cultural relativism."
4981,相对主义要求了解处在某一特定文化背景下的每种现象，这破坏了“男性占据主导地位是错的”这一普遍价值。,"That is, relativism called for understanding every phenomenon in a particular cultural context, which undermined the universal value that male dominance is wrong."
4981,具有讽刺意味的是那些证明在其他文化中有多少女性享有权力位置的研究。,"Ironically, the result was research that proved how many women enjoyed positions of power in other cultures."
4982,家族的声誉至上看来是基本原则。,The basic rule seems to be that a family's reputation is most important.
4982,人们明白，配偶只有在同一种姓和一般社会阶级内部加以安排，如果新娘与新郎家族的阶级地位是相似的话，种姓分支之间稍有交叉也是允许的。虽然印度现在法律禁止嫁妆，但每次婚姻都发生范围广泛的礼物交换。,"It is understood that matches would be arranged only within the same caste and general social class, although some crossing of subcastes is permissible if the class positions of the bride's and groom's families are similar Although dowry is now prohibited by law in India, extensive gift exchanges took place with every marriage."
4982,即使男青年家庭没有“提出要求”，每个姑娘的家庭仍感到有义务送给姑娘、男青年和男青年家庭传统的礼物。,"Even when the boy's family do not ""make demands"", every girl's family nevertheless feels the obligation to give the traditional gifts, to the girl, to the boy, and to the boy's family."
4982,尤其是夫妻两人在将要住在联合家庭——这类家庭甚至在印度都市的中上阶级中仍是相当普遍的——即该夫妻与男青年的父母、他已婚的兄弟以及未婚的同胞兄弟姐妹住在一起，姑娘的家庭渴望在其家庭与男青年的家庭之间建立和谐的关系。,"Particularly when the couple would be living in the joint family—that is, with the boy's parents and his married brothers and their families, as well as with unmarried siblings—which is still very common even among the urban, upper-middle class in India, the girl's parents are anxious to establish smootli relations between their family and that of the boy."
4983,对于如今的人类学（也许还在乡村“里”研究，却不再研究它们本身[Geertz 1973: 22]），牧歌式的他性的习语已经变得多样化了。,"In contemporary anthropology (study ‘in’ villages, perhaps, but no longer ‘of’ them (Geertz 1973:22)), idioms of idyllic otherness have become increasingly diverse."
4983,我们强调性别的他性、身体的他性、全球性的他性、从属性的他性；我们从本质上理想化（“牧歌化”）了他性（作为差别，作为间生性[hybridity]，作为东方学）。,"We emphasize the otherness of gender, of the body, of globality, of subalternality; we idealize (‘idyll-ize’) otherness per se (as difference, as hybridity, as Orientalism)."
4983,然而，我们应该记住的仍旧是关于牧歌的习惯用语和它们要描述的经验现实之间的裂缝。,"What should be borne in mind still, however, is the gap between idyllic idioms and the empirical realities they purport to describe."
4984,二，民族国家的统治者对族性的攻击。,"Second, ethnicity has also been under attack from rulers of nation-states."
4984,当然，我所讨论的是这样一种民族-国家，其疆域内的人民有着不同的族裔起源， 他们被要求服从整体的民族利益。,I am talking of course of that type of nation-state which contains within its territory people of different ethnic origin who are asked to subordinate that origin in the interests of the nation as a whole.
4984,与阶级问题不同，民族被视为人们关爱的客体，而不仅仅是促进某种利益的载体。,"Unlike the case of class, the nation is offered as an object of affection, not merely as a vehicle for advancing an interest."
4985,由于我们已根据性接触权定义了婚姻，所以我们必须明确把婚姻制度与交配分别开来。,"Having defined marriage in terms of sexual access, we must at this point make clear the distinction between systems of marriage and mating."
4985,所有动物，包括人类，都交配——有的是终身的，而有的则不是；有的与单个相反性别的个体交配，有的则与几个个体交配。,"All animals, including humans, mate—some for life and some not, some with a single individual of the opposite sex, and some with several."
4985,婚姻是社会賦予的权利，与婚姻相反，交配仅通过个体努力得到保证和维持。,"Mates are secured and held solely through individual effort, as opposed to marriage, which is a right society confers."
4985,只有婚姻以法律的、经济的、社会 的力量为后盾。,"Only marriage is backed by legal, economic, and social forces."
4985,甚至在纳亚尔人那里，婚姻也很少包括性关系以外的其他东西，一个女子的丈夫依法有义务每隔一定时期要送她礼物。,"Even among the Nayar, where marriage seems to involve little else than a sexual relationship, a woman's husband is legally obligated to provide her with gifts at specified intervals."
4986,迈克尔·奥克肖特（Michael Oakeshott 1962）认为，交谈就是人类文化所要实现的，也是人类社会固有的特征。,"For Michael Oakeshott (1962), conversation is what human cultures accomplish and what human societies inherit."
4986,交谈是代表不同的习惯和方式的个体的声音的汇集。,Conversation is a meeting of individual voices speaking in different idiom or mode.
4986,科学、诗歌、实践行动以及历史都是各种不同的讲述形式。,"Science, poetry, practical activity and history are such modes of speech, different universes of discourse."
4986,“构成”交谈的各个不同的声音，出于不同的习惯和方式，十分多样化。,"It is the very diversity, the manifold of different voices, speaking in different idioms or modes, which ‘makes’ conversation."
4986,这些声音无需构建一定的层次，也无需针对某个言论，其多样性的差异之间可能没有所谓的相互不适宜，在谈论相同主题时也未必非要求一致不可。,"The voices need not compose a hierarchy, and the conversation need not amount to an argument; the diverse voices may differ without disagreeing, and they may appear to be saying the same without agreeing."
4986,因此交谈不是质疑和争论，也不是注释和辩论，也不是为了劝说、驳斥或告知。,"Hence, conversation is not an inquiry or contest, exegesis or debate; it does not set out to persuade, refute, or inform."
4986,交谈不打算揭示什么真理，也不证明什么，它不寻求结论，其推理既不是完备的也不是最重要的，不存在保卫某个实体的持续要求。,"Conversation has no truth to discover, no proposition to prove, no conclusion to seek; reason is neither sovereign nor primary, and there is no accumulating inquiry or body of information to safeguard."
4986,相反，作为“各异的思想片断的翱翔与纠葛”的空间，即在相互刺激与反应中进行有限关联而非同化，从而使个体的思考者参与社会文化生活的“智识推动的练习”中（1962: 198）。,"Instead, as ‘thoughts of different species take wing and play round one another’— responding to and provoking one another’s movement, obliquely interrelating without assimilating—so their individual thinkers engage in the ‘unrehearsed intellectual adventure’ of socio-cultural life (1962:198)."
4986,个体间的交谈无论是在公众面前还是在内部进行，最终都会形成每个人行动和言论的背景。,"Going on in public and inside themselves, a conversation between individuals ultimately contextualizes every human activity and utterance."
4987,有句名言说，经济学是研究人们如何作出选择，而社会学则解释人们为什么别无选择。,"According to the bon mot, economics is about how people make choices while sociology is about why people do not have any choices to make."
4987,人类学对交易的社会文化背景的强调，及其对“交易论”或“行动/实践理论”的理论化过程，都力图协调上述不同的立场。,"An anthropological emphasis on transaction within socio-cultural milieux, and its theorization as ""transactionalism"", or ""action/practice theory"", amounts to an attempt to mediate between these positions."
4987,交易论对以前强调功能或结构的做法提出了重要修正，后两者都努力使社会生活（办公室、规则、权利与义务）的制度化特征具体化，并阐明团结的群体的本质，因此它们都固执地忽略了独立个体的行为。,"Transactionalism has represented an important corrective to earlier functional and structural emphases which managed to reify the institutional features of social life (offices, rules, rights and duties), and essentialize corporate groups so that they somehow persisted irrespective of the actions of distinct individuals."
4988,种姓是社会阶级的一种特殊形式，在种姓中，成员身份由出生决定且终生固定。,Caste is a special form of social class in which membership is determined by birth and fixed for life.
4988,等级内部特别规定内婚制，子女自动属于其父母所在的等级。,"Endogamy is particularly marked within castes, and children automatically belong to their parents' caste."
4988,社会阶级结构以角色分化为基础，尽管这一点本身对于分层而言是不充分的。,"Social class structure is based on role differentiation, although this by itself is not sufficient for stratification."
4988,对各种角色持开放式的肯定和否定态度，以及限制较重要角色的获得机会，也是必要的。,Also necessary are formalized positive and negative attitudes toward roles and restricted access to the more valued ones.
4989,对角色理论的一种常见批评是声称其缺少一种处理社会中的权力关系的能力。,A common criticism of role theory is its alleged lack of ability to deal with power relationships in society.
4989,很明显，社会习俗、角色期望、社会中角色和身份的真正分配，都对权力的系统差异有所影响。,"For it is clear that social conventions, role expectations and the very distribution of roles and statuses in society contribute to systematic differences in power."
4989,一些行动者能够对其他人施加相当大的力量；另一些人对他们自己的生活只具有很少的控制能力，更别提别人的生活了。,"Some actors are able to exert considerable power over others; some have very limited control of their own lives, let alone other people's."
4989,戈夫曼和其他角色理论家在他们的著作中，只是间接地谈到过社会生活的这个维度。,This dimension of social life is only dealt with indirectly in the work of Goffman and other role theorists.
4989,权力是一个令人难以捉摸的概念。,Power is an elusive and difficult concept.
4989,哲学家罗素（Bertrand Russell）曾经说过，社会科学中的权力，就像物理学中的能量：是少数极其核心的概念之一，但是对之进行准确定义却是不可能的。从这个角度来说——不存在一个被普遍认同的权力的定义，他是正确的。,"The philosopher Bertrand Russell once said that power is to the social sciences what energy is to physics: it is one of a handful of extremely central concepts, but it is impossible to define it accurately.Russell is still right to the extent that no definition of power exists which is universally agreed upon."
4989,然而，从权力关系角度来说，不同社会之间存在显而易见并且意义重大的差别，不论是在公共领域还是私人领域。,"Yet there are obvious and clearly very significant differences between societies regarding power relationships, both in the public and the private spheres."
4990,而在法律领域，对教会法规的学习却呈现出繁荣兴盛的势头，博洛尼亚大学的情况更是如此。西罗马皇帝格拉提安以及教皇亚历山大三世（在其出任教皇之前）都曾在这所大学任教，贝克特也曾在这所大学学习过。如此一来，教会法庭和皇家法庭围绕几类主要违法行为的司法处决权的争夺也日趋激烈。此外，两者在关于谁有权起诉和惩治犯有严重罪行的神职人员的问题上也争得不可开交。,"In the legal sphere, the burgeoning of studies in canon law, especially at the University of Bologna where the great Gratian and Pope Alexander III (before his elevation to the papacy) taught and Becket for a while studied, exacerbated the struggle between ecclesiastical and royal courts for jurisdiction over several important categories of offences and for the right to indict and punish clerics who had committed serious crimes."
4991,教派组织的主要特点是其成员的加人是自愿性的（弱区格），对公共利益（强群体）的承诺将他们团结在一起。,The chief characteristic of sects is that their membership is voluntary (low grid); they are held together by commitment to communal interests (high group).
4991,道格拉斯和维达夫斯基认为，20世纪60—70年代之所以在美国兴起 环保热是与教派组织的壮大相关的。,Douglas and Wildavsky suggested that the rise in environmental concern in America in the 1960s and 1970s was related to a growth in sectarian organization.
4991,教派组织通过反对中心 (即阶层制度与市场组织）来维持自我。环境关怀或环保是反对中心的一种适宜的机制，因为他们对阶层制度与市场组织形式的延续所依赖的价值与假设表示怀疑，比如对科学技术以及现行法律和程序的过度依赖（Douglas和Wildavsky 1982: 126)。,"Sects sustain themselves by opposing the centre.Environmental concerns are an appropriate mechanism for doing this because they question the values and assumptions on which the continuation of hierarchical and market forms of organization depend, such as the supremacy of science and technology and confidence in established laws and procedures (Douglas and Wildavsky 1982:126ff.)."
4992,例如，在特定社会中，政治权力和智力声望可能是同等重要的。,"Political power and intellectual prestige could, for instance, be just as important in a given society."
4992,关于阶级和阶层的视角之间的重要差别涉及对冲突的意义的看法。,An important difference between perspectives on classes or strata concerns the significance placed on conflict.
4992,阶级理论几乎就是一种冲突理论，将不同阶级之间的冲突看做是根本性的。,"Class theory is nearly always a kind of conflict theory, seeing the conflicts between different classes as fundamental."
4992,马克思认为阶级斗争是社会变化中最核心的因素，因为成功的阶级斗争最终会导致生产关系（财产关系）的变化和社会秩序的质的改变。,"Marx saw class struggle as the most central factor in social change, since successful class struggles eventually led to changes in the relations of production (property relations) and qualitative changes in the social order."
4992,马克思主义关于阶级的思想和其他有关社会分层或阶级的理论都被批判为是种族中心主义的。,Both Marxist thought about social class and other theories of social strata or classes have been criticised for being ethnocentric.
4993,他着重关注的是那12个男孩中所表现出来的对抗文化，并不时把关注点转向工场和家庭环境（与孩子的父母们讨论），以展示他所着重表现的、产生于学校体验的对抗文化是如何在这些其他重要场所中获得冋应的（家庭场所以及父母的观点表明，这种文化在代际之间不断被再生产，但它形成的地点是在学校，而不是在家庭；而对工场这一场所的描写则表明对抗文化在职业环境中得以延续，并产生了各种极为不同的结果）。,"Centrally he is concerned with a representation of the oppositional culture among his twelve lads, and with some shifting to shop floor and home environments (discussions with parents) to show how the focally represented oppositional culture created from school experience resonates in these other critical locales (the home locale and parental perspective show that the culture is generationally reproduced, but also that the school, not the home, is its site of formation; the shop floor locale shows the continuity of oppositional culture in the work context and its very different consequences)."
4993,可见，为了达到论证的目标，威利斯在文本中对这一体系作了特定的、策略性的限定。,So there is a very specific and strategic circumscribing of the system portrayed in the text for the purposes of Willis's argument.
4993,他也多少注意到了体现在教职工和其他学生中的中产阶级文化，并认识到女孩、西印度群岛裔人和亚洲裔人之间视角的不同，但他主要还是把自己限定在写作一部选点于学校的，关于他的12个叛逆男孩的民族志。,"He pays some attention to middle class culture, as manifested in staff and other students, and he recognizes distinct perspectives for girls, West Indians, a n d Asians, but mainly he keeps to a school-situated ethnography of his twelve nonconformist boys."
4994,弗雷泽的第二条原则被称为“接触巫术”(contagious magic)，它指这样一种观念，即事物或人之间一旦发生接触就能彼此影响，即使此后不再接触。,Frazer's second principle was called contagious magic—the concept that things or persons once in contact can afterward influence one another.
4994,关于接触 巫术的一个最常见的例子是，一个人和他或她身体的任何一个部分——比如头发、 指甲或者牙齿——之间有永久的联系。,"The most common example of contagious magic is the permanent relationship between an individual and any part of his or her body, such as hair, fingernails, or teeth."
4994,弗雷泽引用了这样一个例子：住在非洲南 部的莱索托王国的巴苏陀人，总是很小心地藏匿他们被拔掉的牙齿，因为这些牙齿可能会落入某些神秘的存在之手，而后者可以通过对这些牙齿施以巫术来伤害牙 齿的主人。,"Frazer cites the Basutos of Lesotho, in southern Africa, who were careful to conceal their extracted teeth, because these might fall into the hands of certain mythical beings who could harm the owners of the teeth by working magic on them."
4994,与此相关的是，在西方社会中，人们有珍藏特殊人物触碰过的东西的习俗。这些东西有圣人的遗物、其他受人敬佩的或偶像化个人的所有物等。,"Related to this is the custom, in Western societies, of treasuring objects that have been touched by special people."
4995,我已借用道格拉斯的模式阐述了文化理论是如何被用来分析环境決定论的，但是，我并不希望证明她研究文化的方法就是最合适的。事实上，她的文化理论中也有矛盾，确认这些矛盾便于我们从她的理论中选择哪些是有用的。,"I have used Douglas' model as an illustration of how cultural theory has been used in the analysis of environmentalism, but I would not wish to argue that her approach to culture is the most appropriate.In fact, there are contradictions in it which make it impossible to swallow whole, and it is important to identify these in order to be able to select from it what is valuable."
4995,道格拉斯的文化理论中最突出的问题是断言社会组织形式模塑或决定文化视角。,The most controversial feature of Douglas' theory is the assertion that forms of social organization cause or determine cultural perspectives.
4995,决定论被认为是人类学中不同结构主义方法的主要祸首之一（尤其是像道格拉斯的模式等结构功能主义严重地受到杜尔凯姆的影响），而后结构主义人类学家也试图摒弃决定论。,"Determinism was seen as one of the major evils of the various structuralist approaches in anthropology (in particular, structural-functionalism which, like Douglas' model, was heavily influenced by Durkheim) and which post-structuralist anthropologists sought to leave behind."
4995,决定论的主要问题和缺陷是完全否认了选择的可能性，因而也就否认了变迁的可能性，而在后结构主义的方法中，变迁是人们选择以不同的方式从事活动或进行思考的结果。,"The main problem with determinism is that it appears to deny the possibility of choice and therefore of change, since change is assumed, in post-structuralist approaches, to result from people choosing to act or think differently."
4996,国家层次或全球层次的种族隔离，不论是官方的还是非官方的，其后果之一是出现大量的结构性暴力（structural violence）:由处境、制度以及社会、政治和经济结构造成的暴力。例如，在亚洲南部国家中，有25%—50%的初生儿体重不足。这对儿童的大脑发育和今后的健康都有严重影响。,"One of the consequences of a system of apartheid, whether official or unofficial and on the state or global level, is a great deal of structural violence: violence exerted by situations, institutions, and social, political, and economic structures."
4996,造成这个问题的原因是母亲和胎儿的营养不足和营养不良。,"To survive, these countries will have to make drastic cuts in social services, while industry downsizing and failures will cause untold numbers of people to lose their jobs."
4996,对于这种情况的受害者来说，其效果就是暴力，尽管它不是由某个特定个休的敌意行动引起的。,"As far as the victims of this economic calamity are concerned, the effect is violent, even though the cause was not the hostile act of a specific individual."
4996,这种暴力的来源是一个匿名的结构 (经济），而这就是所谓结构性暴力的全部含义。,"The source of the violence was an anonymous structure (the economy), and this is what structural violence is all about."
4997,世界观的不同只是人们对其周围世界的解释不同而已。,World views would be different simply because the worlds they depict are different.
4997,极端建构主义形式的一个更具说服力的观点是，社会建构了特殊的世界，但相同的原材料却组成了不同的社会事实。,"A more reasonable reading of the extreme form of constructivism is that societies construct distinct worlds, composed of different truths, out of the same raw material."
4997,建构主义的形式越折中，就越能凸现出它奠定了以象征人类学与语义人类学名义进行写作的基础。,"The more moderate form of constructivism is the more familiar, in that it forms the basis of much that has been written in the name of symbolic or semantic anthropology."
4997,建构主义坚持世界多样性的观点，其多样性不同于对一般现实的多种解释。,It holds that diverse world views are different interpretations of a common reality.
4997,因此与其说多样性的社会事实构成了文化，不如说文化构建于多重意义之上。,"Rather than being composed of diverse truths, cultures are composed of diverse meanings."
4998,如今萨特的某些措辞看起来有些老套、大男子主义或者洋洋自得；但这可以以安全富足的资产阶级的信条形式出现，能够对自身进行反思，也能够决定“他”与这些处境或者他生活的环境的关系，能够主张特定的生命尊严。事实上.这使得一些人类学家反对这种简单的存在主义倾向。,"Some of Sartre's phraseology seems old-fashioned now, sexist and selfsatisfied; it can appear the credo of the secure and resourceful bourgeois, able to reflect on the self, to determine ""his"" relations to the conditions or circumstances of his life, and to lay claim to a certain lifesome dignity Indeed, this has led some anthropologists to reject such an existentialist orientation tout court."
4998,不过这种解读是肤浅的，也是错误的；避免特定性别的语言形式依然不那么容易，可是萨特却通过他的话简洁地指出了众多重要的事实。以下就详细阐述他的一些观点。,"However, such a reading is superficial, and mistaken; avoiding gender-specific linguistic formulations may still not be easy, but by his words Sartre succinctly points up a number of important truths.Let me elaborate upon a number of his phrases in turn."
4999,这种批评可能会引发众多的反应。,There are a number of possible responses to this critique.
4999,一种是简单的坚持存在主义和理性主义的立场，认为文化相对主义和解构不过是种朴素的错误。,One is simply to reassert an existentialist and rationalist position and say that cultural relativism and deconstruction are just plain wrong.
4999,科学、医学、历史、文学和旅行都证明了存在普遍的人性以及其中所包含的意识和经验天生的个体性（Rapport 1994a，1997a）。,"Science, medicine, history, literature and travel prove the existence of a universal humanity, and the inherent individuality of consciousness and experience through which it is embodied (cf. Rapport 1994a, 1997a)."
5000,虽然解剖学方面的调适对灵长目动物来说是重要的，但它不是对付环境的唯一方式。,"Important though anatomical adaptation has been to the primates, it has not been the only way of coping with the environment."
5000,对现代猴子和类人猿的研究表明，习得的社会行为在调适中起重要作用。虽然现存的灵长目动物显示的行为范围很大，但是通过考察与人类关系最近的种——特别是黑猩猩、倭黑猩猩，以及其他类人猿——或者考察如狒狒这样的种 (它们已适应的环境，在某种程度上类惊于我们袓先数百万年前面对的那些环境），我们就可以发现对人类文化行为产生做出贡献的那些模式的线索。,"Studies of monkeys and apes living today indicate that learned social behavior plays an important role in adaptation.The range of behavior living primates show is great, but by looking at the behavior of the species most closely related to humans—chimpanzees in particular and the other great apes as well—or of ones such as baboons that have adapted to environments somewhat similar to those our own ancestors faced millions of years ago, we may discover clues to patterns that contributed to the emergence of human cultural behavior."
5001,在哲学上，人类解释上的同义反复或循环的特点被称为“解释循环”。,"In philosophical deliberation, the tautological or circular nature of human interpretation has become known as ‘the hermeneutic circle’."
5001,对人而言，除了事物的熵和流量外，还没有什么是必定或简单的存在于世界“那儿”。,"For human beings, there is nothing that is necessarily or simply ‘there’ in the world besides the entropy of matter, or flux."
5001,存在的只是我们所期望在那的，且只有通过特定的参与活动，我们才可作出有意义的解释，并就此“稳固”我们的世界。,"What is there is a matter of what we anticipate to be there, and only by courtesy of a system of anticipations do we make meaningful interpretations and hence ‘fix’ our world."
5002,然而，不应就此认为，后殖民时代的安排就比一战后的安排更理想、更高级，它们显然是不同的，因为它们基于不同的背景和环境。,"However, it would be wrong to conclude that the post-colonial arrangements were ideal or ‘superior’ to the post-World War I model.They were simply different because they were dictated by different circumstances."
5002,随后，情况改变了。,The subsequent experiences have varied.
5002,尽管在总体上后殖民时代的安排依然可行，但出现了一些情况，诸如印度的分裂和巴基斯坦的解体，以及换个视角来看，还有印尼的领土扩张。,"Although on the whole the post-colonial arrangements were viable, there were also such experiences as the partition of India and the dissolution of Pakistan, as well as, on the other side of the spectrum, the territorial expansion of Indonesia."
5003,进化论描述了自然对文化、陌生的对熟悉的、唯心论视角对唯物论视角。,"The theory of evolution portrays the relationship of the natural to the cultural, the exotic to the familiar, ideational perspectives to materialistic perspectives."
5003,所有这些关系被构想成一个全景故事。,All these relationships are envisioned as a panoramic story.
5003,人类的进化从“自然”开始，结束于“文化”——从细胞到动物，从类人猿到猿人，最后从野人到文明人。,"Humans evolve from ""natural"" beginnings to cultural endings – cell to animal, hominoid to hominid, and finally savage to civilized."
5003,不论是生物上还是文化上的变异，都可通过自然（或文化）选择原理来进行解释——在多样的情境中，每个特质都是适应某一个特殊环境的产物。,"Variation, whether biological or cultural, is explained by the principle of natural (or cultural) selection operating in varying circumstances such that each trait results from adaptation to a particular environment."
5004,历史过程和进化过程在具有时相特性方面是类似的，两者都是非重复和不可逆的过程。,"The historic process and the evolutionary process are alike in being temporal in character, i.e., non-repetitive and irreversible."
5004,但历史过程仅仅是时相性的，而进化过程则兼备形态持性，它是形态的时相顺序（temporal-sequence-of-forms)。,"But, whereas the historic process is merely temporal, the evolutionary process is formal as well: it is a temporal-sequence-of-forms."
5004,从历史上看，艾利·惠特尼（Eli Whitney)和发明轨棉机在编年顺序上似是不可分割的事件。,Historically Eli Whitney and the invention of the cotton gin are inseparable events in a chronological sequence.
5004,但是，如果惠特尼在童年殃折，技术的进化过程仍然会产卡出一架轨棉花的机器。,But had Whitney died in his cradle the evolutionary process expressed in technology would have produced a machine for ginning cotton.
5005,现代化理论在区域研究计划中占据着主导地位。,This work was dominated by modernization theory.
5005,因为单线进化论的复苏以及它与极化类型（polar types)的社会学传统的结合，现代化理论造成了传统社会和现代社会之间的对立以及对传统社会将不可避免地转变为现代社会的期许。,"In a revival of unilineal evolutionism combined with the sociological tradition of polar types, modernization theory posed an opposition between traditional and modern societies and an expectation that the traditional would inevitably be transformed into the modern."
5005,研究的焦点是在不同的情境下促进或阻碍这种进步的条件。,The focus of research was on the conditions in different settings that aided or impeded that progress.
5005,这种方法在公共政策讨论中变得十分流行，在这些讨论中，这一方法又被当时更具影响力的政治学学者往前推进。,"This approach became common currency in public-policy discussions, where it was advanced by the more influential political scientists of the time."
5006,在人类学中，在任何既定框架中的一套互为对立的理论观点方面和在理论层次的一个层面方面的思考都是大有裨益的。,"Within anthropology, it is useful to think in terms of both a set of competing theoretical perspectives within any given framework, and a hierarchy of theoretical levels."
5006,我们以进化论和传播论为例。,"Take evolutionism and diffusionism, for example."
5006,进化论是一种人类学观点，它强调文化复杂性随着时间发展而增强。,Evolutionism is an anthropological perspective which emphasizes the growing complexity of culture through time.
5006,传播论是一种强调理念从一个地方传播到另一个地方的观点。,Diffusionism is a perspective which emphasizes the transmission of ideas from one place to another.
5007,这样的概化可以是全方位的，就像第2章提到的瑟维斯的进化潜在律，也可以是范围有限和精确的。,"Such generalizations may be global, as in Service's law of evolutionary potential, mentioned in Chapter 2, but they may also be more restricted and precise."
5007,考古学家麦克尼什认为，在墨西哥的提华坎（Tehuacan)谷，允许部分永久性的小村庄社区出现、有可持续的农业，必须满足一些条件，包括增长的人口、定居不动和市场上不断增加的地方交换。,"One archeologist, R. MacNeish, states a set of conditions that are necessary and sufficient to permit the emergence of semi-permanent hamlet communities with subsistence agriculture in the Tehuacan Valley in Mexico; such conditions include increasing population and sedentariness and increasing local exchange in markets."
5007,这类概化建立在对历史进程——什么随着什么出现——仔细的追踪基础之上，有时也会补充使用比较方法，以了解全球分布的因素的共变。,"These kinds of generalizations are based on careful tracing of sequences in history – what follows what – and are sometimes supplemented by the comparative method, which traces covariation among elements distributed globally."
5008,早期的遗传学研究者认为，乱伦禁忌防止近亲繁殖的有害后果。,Early students of genetics argued that the incest taboo precluded the harmful effects of inbreeding.
5008,"尽管这一点是真的，但是就家畜方面看，近亲繁殖除了增加有害的特质外,也会增加有利的特质，这也是实情。","Although this is so, it is also true that, as with domestic animals, inbreeding can increase desired characteristics as well as detrimental ones."
5008,此外，不良结果比没有近亲繁殖的暴露得要快，因此，造成不良结果的无论是什么基因，很快就从种群中根除了。,"Furthermore, undesirable effects show up sooner than without inbreeding, so whatever genes are responsible for them are quickly eliminated from the population."
5008,"然而，対不同基因配偶的偏爱,确实往往在种群内维持比较高的基因多样性水平，在演化中它一般根据种群优势起作用。","However, a preference for a genetically different mate does tend to maintain a higher level of genetic diversity within a population, and in evolution this generally works to a species' advantage."
5008,从生物学方面看，没有基因的多样性，在调适变得必要的时候，一个种群就不可能调适于变化了的环境。,Without genetic diversity a species cannot adapt biologically to a changed environment when and if this becomes necessary.
5009,人类形成许多种类的群体，每一种群体都适合于解决人们必须对付的问题。,"Humans form many kinds of groups, each geared coward solving different kinds of problems people must cope wich."
5009,社会群体对人类来说是至关重要的，还因为它们给予其成员以身份和支持人类社会的基本组成部分是家户。人们在家户中组织经济生产、消费、继承、儿童养育和居住。,"Social groups are important to humans also because they give identity and support to their members.The basic building block of human societies is the household, where economic production, consumption, inheritance, child rearing and shelter are organized."
5009,家户的核心通常是由某种形式的家庭构成的，家庭是一群源自父母一子女联系和男女之间相互依赖的亲属。,"Usually, the core of the household consists of some form of family, a group of relatives that stems from the parent-child bond and the interdependence of men and women."
5009,虽然家庭可能有不同的结构，但它永远提供男女之间的经济合作，同时也提供儿童养育所必需的那种环境。,"Although it may be structured in many different ways, the family always provides for economic cooperation between men and women while furnishing the kind of setting required for child rearing."
5010,无论有效的交流和教育对于文化的持续存在有多么重要，倘若文化不能够满足按其规则生活的个人的基本需要，那么它们就是无用的。,"Important as effective communication and education are for the survival of a culture, they are of no avail unless the culture can satisfy the basic needs of the individuals who live by its rules."
5010,因此，文化的第三个必要条件，是因时因地为其成员提供食物、水和保护的能力。,"A third requirement of culture, therefore, is the ability to provide its members with food, water, and protection from the elements."
5010,第六章讨论文化应付人们基本需要的方式以及社会通过文化调适于环境的方式。,Chapter 6 discusses the ways cultures handle people's basic needs and the ways societies adapt to the environment through culture.
5010,因为这导致物品生产、分配和消费——经济人类学主题——所以我们在本编最后一章（第七章）讨论经济体系。,"Since this leads to the production, distribution, and consumption of goods—the subject matter of economic anthropology—we conclude this section with a chapter (Chapter 7) on economic systems."
5011,事实上，个体总是在不断地再造他们的意义、感知、评价以及行动；他们否定自己创造物的本质并加以重塑。,"Indeed, individuals are for ever in the process of remaking their meanings, senses, evaluations and actions; they negate the essence of their own creations and create again."
5011,他们看上去似乎被环绕在客观的历史社会文化的当下中的“真实现实”里，可是他们不过是延续了后者的粗暴，通过意义想象的持续的可能性来超越纯粹的事物核心。,"They might seem to be surrounded by the ‘actual facts’ of an objective historico-socio-cultural present, but they can nonetheless transcend the latters’ brutishness, and hence surpass a mere being-in-the-midst-ofthings by attaining the continuous possibility of imagined meanings."
5011,在（结构）已给定的可能性和那些成为个体生活一部分的可能性之间存在长期（单一）的相互影响；个体经验不可简约为客观决定性（Kearney 1988: 255-41）。,Between the (structurally) given and what this becomes in an individual life there is a perennial (and unique) interplay; individual experience cannot be reduced to objective determinants (cf. Kearney 1988:225–41).
5012,它在理论与实践之间以及教学与研究之间的分离，它所具有的可观的理论连续性，以及它相对来说较晚的学科建制以及田野工作转向都使得法国人类学可以声称自己是一种具有真正独特性的国别化人类学流派。,"In its separation of theory and practice and of teaching and research, and in its considerable theoretical continuities and its relatively late institutionalization and turn to fieldwork, French anthropology can claim true distinction as a national anthropological school."
5012,然而虽然这种独特流派对于更加宽泛的法国学术传统来说也仍然是这样的，但它并不是孤立的。,"Yet although this school has remained true to French intellectual traditions more widely, it has not been isolated."
5012,现代法国社会思想既汲取了自身的理性主义和普遍主义传统，也借鉴了德国诠释学和现象学以及英国的经验主义；它还扩展了自己的海外影响力，不仅是对英国——在那里它或许可以说是主导性的——而且还对美国和德国。,"Modern French social thought has drawn on German hermeneutics and phenomenology and on British empiricism as well as on its own more rationalist and universalist traditions; it has also spread its influence abroad, not only to Britain, where it has perhaps been dominant, but also to America and Germany."
5012,因此，法国被列为当今世界最重要的社会思想和民族志实践生产者之一，实属实至名归。,France therefore fully deserves its status as one of the world's leading producers of social thought and ethnographic practice.
5013,以性行为的问题为例，就像人们做的任何事情一样，它是由文化塑造的。,"Take, for example, the matter of sex, which, like anything people do, is shaped by culture."
5013,在任何社会，性行为都是重要的，因为它有助于巩固男女之间的合作关系，并确保社会本身绵延不绝。,"Sex is important in any society, for it helps to strengthen cooperative bonds between men and women and ensures the perpetuation of the society itself."
5013,然而，性对社会生存也可能是破坏性的；如果谁对谁有性享用权没有明确的规定，对性特权的竞争就可能摧毁人类生存所依赖的合作关系。,"Yet sex can be disruptive to social living; if who has sexual access to whom is not clearly spelled out, competition for sexual privileges can destroy the cooperative bonds human survival depends upon."
5013,没有控制的性活动也可能导致使社会人口超过其资源的生殖率。,"Uncontrolled sexual activity, too, can result in reproductive rates that cause a society's population to outstrip its resources."
5013,因此，每一种文化在塑造性行为时，它必须使社会需要与个人充分满足保持平衡，免得失望情绪不断增长达到破坏社会本身的地步。,"Hence, as they shape sexual behavior, every culture must balance the needs of society againsr the need for sufficient individual gratification, lest frustration build until it causes disruption."
5014,本尼迪克特借用19世纪的哲学家和文学评论家弗里德里希•尼采(Friedrich  Nietzsche )始创的对希腊悲剧的划分方法，把祖尼人与其他北美土著进行比较。,"Benedict contrasts the Zuñi to them, using a distinction invented by the nineteenth-century philosopher and literary critic, Friedrich Nietzsche."
5014,尼采认为希腊悲剧中有两种因素：“日神精神”和“酒神精神”。,He had distinguished two elements of Greek tragedy: the ‘Apollonian’ and the ‘Dionysian’.
5014,日神精神指审慎、克制、和谐。酒神精神指情感、激情、无节制。,"The Apollonian aspect is that of measure, restraint, and harmony; the Dionysian aspect, that of emotion, passion, and excess."
5015,后来，拉德克利夫－布 朗 (Radcliffe - Brown 1952 [1924]: 15 - 31) 和列维－斯特劳斯（Lévi - Strauss 1963 [ 1945 ] : 31 - 54 ) 先后讨论过这种亲子和甥舅之间的经典关系。,"Much later, RadcliVe-Brown (1952 [1924]: 15– 31) and Le ́vi-Strauss (1963 [1945]: 31–54) were to debate this classic set of relations between a boy and his father and a boy and his mother’s brother."
5015,"马林诺夫斯基对他特别感兴趣的“舅权"" (avunculate)问题的贡献在于其论据来自深刻的田野民族志洞察力，而不仅仅来自跨文化比较。",What makes Malinowski’s contribution to the ‘avunculate’ problem of special interest is that his argument is from deep ethnographic insight and not simply from cross-cultural comparison.
5015,这可能使得他具有优势，至少能对弗洛伊德的观点提出异议。,
5015,,"This is perhaps what gave him the edge, at least against Freud."
5016,这幕戏剧开始的场景颇有一些奇特的暗示：在贝克特所经历的多数通过仪式中，通常是他自己来面对新的人生历程，并且要由自己来亲身经历各种磨难，但是这一次的仪式却完全掌握在国王的手里，国王不知不觉中成了这一仪式的始作俑者。在修道院中，贝克特完全与世俗的社会相隔绝——修道院无疑就成为一个具有中介潜质的场所。也就在此时，国王和他的贵族们也聚集在城堡中召开法律一政治会议。,"And there is about all this still the curious suggestion of an initiation scenario: just as in many initiation rituals Becket the neophyte went through ordeal, in this case at the king's hands, the king being an unconscious initiator.Becket was enclosed from secular society in his abbey—a liminal place if ever there was—while the king and his baronry were lodged in the castle where the jural-political meetings also were held."
5017,传教士的梦想就是一个梦想，因为它拒绝认可非洲的遗产，试图抹去那些历史。,"The missionary dream was indeed a dream, for it refused to recognise the African legacy, and tried to wipe clean those histories."
5017,那注定要失败，但它在牙买加人的想象中和民族归属的性别形式上留下烙印，而且后者一直延续到现在。,"It was doomed to failure, but it has left its mark on the Jamaican imagination and on the gendered forms of national belonging which have survived into the present."
5017,围绕着民族和民族主义的性别问题也许在军事冲突时期表现得最为尖锐，那时男人和女人的身体成为冲突的场所。,"Gender issues around nation and nationalism are perhaps most sharply articulated during periods of military conflict, when men's and women's bodies become the site of that conflict."
5018,那些允许大量流动的社会被称为开放的阶级社会（open-class societies)。,Those that permit a great deal of mobility are referred to as open-class societies.
5018,但是，甚至在这种社会中，流动通常也比人们能够想象的更有限。,"Even here, however, mobility is apt to be more limited than one might suppose."
5018,在美国，尽管它有“从乞丐到富翁”的意识形态，但大多数的流动都只造成向上或向下移动一点点——尽管如果这种移动在一个家庭中连续发生好几代的话，也可能造成一个大的改变。,"In the United States, in spite of its t4rags to riches” ideology, most mobility involves a move up or down only a notch, although if this continues in a family for several generations, it may add up to a major change."
5019,我的论点并非是要说所有这四个领域都与所有的问题有关联，而是说它们彼此之间的连接各不相同并且这种连接取决于实际出现的问题。,"My argument is not that all four fields are relevant to all problems, but rather that they are linked differently to one another and that the linkages depend on the problem at hand."
5019,因此，象征人类学离不开语言学，而人类进化的研究不仅需要生物人类学和考古学，在处理某些问题时，它还需要语言学和文化人类学。但四领域结构的批评者指出，大部分的人类学研究并不需要冒失地跳出它自己的领域，这也是实情。,"Thus, symbolic anthropology cannot do without linguistics, while human evolutionary studies require not only biological anthropology and archaeology, but also linguistic and cultural anthropology for some problems; but it is the case, as critics of the four-field structure argue, that much of anthropological research does not necessitate venturing out of one's own field."
5019,然而，我们始终无法事先预料到在什么时候、什么地方，跨领域的合作将是富有成效的。,"Nevertheless, it cannot always be predicted in advance when and where cross-field collaboration will be productive."
5019,因此，对美国人类学来说，重要的是保持沟通渠道的畅通和保证新的一代受到良好的训练，使他们能够充分理解到：当需求或机会出现时，除了它们自身外，所有的学科都能够从其他领域的贡献中汲取养分。,"For that reason, I think it is important for American anthropology as a whole to keep the lines of communication open and to ensure that new generations are trained with enough understanding of all the fields to be able to benefit from the contributionsof specialties other than their own when the need or opportunity arises."
5020,《布伦特兰报告》还将教育作为衡量“人口素质”的 一个“关键尺度”（世界环境与发展委员会1987:105)。,"The Brundtland Report also treated education as a ""key dimension of 'population quality'"" (WCED 1987:105)."
5020,这里的教育指的是一般由国家体系提供的教育，而不包括非工业社会儿童通过参与生计活动而得到的传统训练。,"What is meant here is the kind of education generally provided by state systems, and not the training received traditionally by children in non-industrial societies through their participation in subsistence economies."
5020,反全球论者认为国家教育是推行“科学帝国主义”的重要机制之一，通过这种教育用“知识”（episteme)取代了 “技艺”（techne) (Marglin 1990)。,"Anti-globalists would argue that state education hasbeen one of the principal mechanisms through which ""scientific imperialism"" has advanced, through which ""techne"" is replaced by ""episteme"" (Marglin 1990)."
5021,所以福斯特父子的工作不仅仅深植于当时的时代精神中，还深植于发源于16世纪和17世纪的人文主义和科学革命的坚实传统中。,"So the Forsters' work was embedded not only in a Zeitgeist, but also in a solid tradition emanating from humanism and the scientific revolutions of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries."
5021,另外，福斯特父子的工作在当时也并非绝无仅有。,"In addition, the Forsters' work was not unique in its time."
5021,"更晚一点的先驱人物要算彼得·科尔布（Peter Kolb 1719）,他对南非尤其是科伊科伊（Khoikhoi）的描述成为那个地区民族志的里程碑式的素材（Raum 2001）。","A more recent forerunner was Peter Kolb (1719), whose description of Southern Africa and,in particular,of the Khoikhoi became a milestone source for ethnographic accounts of that region (Raum 2001)."
5022,在《西太平洋的航海者》（1922）的导论中，布罗尼斯拉夫˙马林诺夫斯基庆贺了专业的科学民族志的诞生：“一个时代已经结束，在那个时代我们可以容忍把土著人描绘成失真幼稚的人物漫画呈示铪我们。,"In his introduction to Argonauts of the Western Pacific (1922) Bronislaw Malinowski celebrates the advent of professional, scientific ethnography: ""The time when we could tolerate accounts presenting us the native as a distorted, childish caricature of a human being are gone,"" he declares."
5022,”他宣称，那样的画像是虚假的，就像许多其他谎言一样已被科学截穿”（Malinowski 1961:11）。,"""This picture is false, and like many other falsehoods, it has been killed by Science"" (Malinowski 1961:11)."
5022,这一论断表明民族志作者中业已形成一种惯习，即将民族志写作定义为高于和对立于旧有的不太专业化的写作体裁，诸如游记（travel books)、个人回忆录、报刊文章，以及传教士、移民和殖民地官员等人的记述。,"The statement is symptomatic of a well-established habit among ethnographers of defining ethnographic writing over and against older, less specialized genres, such as travel books, personal memoirs, journalism, and accounts by missionaries, settlers, colonial officials, and the like."
5023,乔治˙艾略特（George Eliot)的小说成为这种参与观察的情形的缩影，这种观察是在一个“通常条件下……在一个可知的共同体中，在虚构的过去中。,"George Eliot's novels epitomize this situation o f participant-observation in a ""common condition ...a knowable community, belong[ing] ideally in the past."""
5023,”例如，《米德尔马契》（Middlemarch）将一代人从它的写作年代投射到1830年。,"Middlemarch, for example, is projected a generation back from the time of its writing to 1830."
5023,而且，这是当许多常规民族志用现在时态描写一种正在过去的现实——“传统”生活——时，它们所假设的大概的时间距离。,"And this is approximately the temporal distance that many conventional ethnographies assume when they describe a passing reality, ""traditional"" life, in the present tense."
5023,对一个可知的共同体的虚构“可以为了一个广泛的道德行动而被再创造。但被采取的真正步骤是放弃任何对现存社会的直接反应。作为一个普遍的回溯性条件，价值存在于过去；价值也存在于现在，但只能作为一种特殊的和私有的感性、作为个人的道德行动”（第180页）。,"The fiction of a knowable community ""can be recreated there for a widely ranging moral action. But the real step that has been taken is withdrawal from any full response to an existing society. Value is in the past, as a general retrospective condition, and is in the present only as a particular and private sensibility, the individual moral action"" (180)."
5024,"在此有必要针对克拉伦顿法令（罗伯逊，《文献材料汇编》，1883,第5卷：第71页）事先做一些说明。在这次著名的制宪会议上，亨利胁迫英国所有的主教接受了这些条款，这也就意味 着北安普敦会议必定充满着矛盾和冲突。","Something should first be said, however, about the Constitutions of Clarendon (Robertson, Materials, 1883, vol. 5:71), which Henry had forced the bench of English bishops to accept at the celebrated meeting there, for these set the terms of the Northampton confrontation."
5024,贝克特本人则表现得顾虑重重、意志软弱，进而采取妥协让步的方式试图平息国王的怒气。,Becket himself had then quailed and faltered and sought to appease the king.
5025,但北美土著和西非的一些社会，因为有一系列繁多的禁止婚姻的规则，所以从个人而不是从血统的观点看，与一般性的交换相似。,"However, some societies, especially in Native North America and West Africa, have such an extensive array of negative marriage rules that their systems, from an individual though not a lineage point of view, come to resemble those of generalized exchange."
5025,例如，布基纳法索的萨摩 ( Samo) 男子，不能与其自己父系群体中的人，或他母亲的、他奶奶的或姥姥的父系群体中的成员结婚。,"For example, among the Samo of Burkina Faso, a man must not marry a member of his own patrilineal group, or his mother’s, his father’s mother’s, or his mother’s mother’s patrilineal group."
5025,这种“半复杂”或称“克劳－奥马哈”制度（因两支北美土著民族 而得名），介于更典型的复杂形式和基本形式之间。（参见 Heritier 1981 :  73 - 136),These ‘semi-complex’ or ‘Crow-Omaha’ systems (called after two Native North American peoples) thus lie in-between the more typically complex and the elementary ones (see He ́ritier 1981: 73–136).
5026,对于那些不熟悉它的人来说，克劳制似乎非常复杂而且不合逻辑。,"To those unfamiliar with it, the Crow system seems terribly complex and illogical."
5026,它为什么会存在？,Why does it exist?
5026,在诸如霍皮人那样的社会，个体的身份取决于对继嗣群体的附属，而继嗣又是母系的，不顾代际区别而把父亲的姐妹，以及她的女儿、甚至她的母亲都归在—个单一的称呼之下，这是讲得通的。,"In societies such as that of the Hopi, where individual identity is dependent on descent group affiliation and descent is matrilineal, it makes sense to merge the father sister, her daughter, and even her mother together under a single term, regardless of generation."
5026,这些女人都通过生育“自我”的那个世系群来追溯自己袓先，就好像一个男性“自我”的子女，以及“自我”母亲兄弟的子女，是通过“自我”世系群的男人生肓的一样。,"These are women descent is traced through in the lineage that sired ego, just as a male ego's children，along with those of his mother's brother, were sired by men of ego's lineage."
5026,因此，“自我”将自己母亲这一方的交表兄弟姐妹同于“自我”孩子那一辈就完全合乎逻辑了。,"Thus, it is perfectly logical for ego to equate his maternal cross cousins with his children's generation."
5027,在李·杜鲁门看来，大约过去400年中，连续不断的资本主义商品交易累积了数量庞大的全球移民，包括自愿的和非自愿的。可以认为，这些移民已经改变了绝大多数社会。,"For Lee Drummond, the culmination of some 400 years of massive global migration, voluntary and involuntary, of a continuous traffic in capitalist commodities, can be seen to have transformed most societies."
5027,然而，其结果并不是那些分散的社会及其特征的重新整合，并整齐地结合成一个新社会，也不是一种旧有的分散社会肩并肩地各自保持自己的文化独特性的多数状态。,"However, the result of these transformations is neither new integrations of what were once separate societies and features of societies, now fitting neatly together as one, nor pluralities whereby old separate societies simply retain their cultural distinctivenesses side by side."
5027,相反，结果是很多社会文化的连续融合或联合：即“克里奥尔化”。,"Rather, what results are socio-cultural continua or combinations: ‘creolizations’."
5028,隐喻概念基于假定以不同的方式理解现实领域之间的差异性。,
5028,换句话说，我们借助某物提供的隐喻来理解其他事物。,"In other words, something has to provide the metaphors through which something else is understood."
5028,比如说，在伯尔德关于“人类与自然相关性的隐喻化”的比较分析中 (Bird-David 1993)，人际关系被看作是为狩猎一采集社会与其环境之间互动所提供的隐喻。,"For instance, in Bird-David's comparative analysis of the ""metaphorization of human-nature relatedness"" (Bird-David 1993), interpersonal relationships are seen as providing metaphors for the interaction between selected hunter-gatherer societies and their environments."
5028,"因此，克利猎人与其采石场是由性隐喻来表达的——狩猎被描述为一种性交行为——而那亚卡人、巴特克人和姆布提人把森林描述为父亲和母亲（Bird-David 1993:113,120)。","Thus, the relationship between Cree hunters and their quarry is expressed through a sexual metaphor—hunting is described as an act of sexual intercourse—while the Nayaka, Batek and Mbuti describe the forest as a parent (Bird-David 1993:113, 120)."
5028,在这些案例中，人与环境的关系是以“隐喻化的”现实来体现的，人类社会关系是由从现实中提取的恰当隐喻来“非隐喻化的”（unmetaphorized)现实。,"In these cases, the human-environment relationships are presented as ""metaphorized"" reality, and human social relationships are the ""unmetaphorized"" reality from which appropriate metaphors are drawn."
5029,不可能对刻板印象和“事实”之间的关系做出一个总体的声明。,"It is impossible to make a general statement about the relationship of stereotypes to ""facts""."
5029,它们可能是夸张的，对社会事实进行了过于一般化和理想化的描绘。,"They can be exaggerated, overly generalising and ideologically charged descriptions of social facts."
5029,当毛里求斯的克利奥尔人将印度人描述成是小气的，这种刻板印象对应于印度人认为自己是勤劳而有责任感的民族的刻板印象。,"When the Creoles of Mauritius describe the Hindus as miserly, this stereotype corresponds to one that Hindus hold of themselves as hard-working and responsible people."
5030,此外，很显然，不可能把所有事物都包含在描述中，即使你的目标是提供一种对该社会的全面说明并且安排了长篇大论于此。让我们仔细研究内部看法和外部看法之间的关系。,"In addition, it would be plainly impossible to include everything in a description, even if one's aim is to provide a comprehensive account of a society and one has a thousand pages at one's disposal.Let us look a little more closely at the relationship between the view from within and the view from the outside."
5030,某种程度上，民族志的描述比其分析与受访者的经验世界离得更近些，因为后者完全是以对文化和社会的一般论述为目标的。,"Ethnographic description lies closer, in a sense, to the world as experienced by the informants than the analysis does, as the latter may ultimately aim at general statements about culture and society."
5030,这个层次——由该社会本身的成员自己经验和描述的生活——某些时候被称为“主位”观察；与其相对，外部观察者的分析式描述或解释，叫做“客位”观察层次。,"This level – life as experienced and described by the members of a society themselves – is sometimes spoken of as the ""emic"" level.Its counterpart, the analytical descriptions or explanations of the researcher, is the ""etic"" level."
5031,“世界中发生的每个事件，都是受空间座标x、y、z和时间座标t制约的。”诸事件间的基本关系或“间隔”，就是空间一时间关系。,"""Every event that happens in the world is determined by the space-co-ordinates x, y, z and the time-co-ordinate t,"" The fundamental relationship, or ""interval,"" between events is one of space-time."
5031,虽然以往曾将空间和时间设想为外部世界之彼此独立的属性，但现在已把这两者看成不过是某种基本的和首要的属性即空间一时间的诸侧面而已。,"Whereas formerly space and time were thought of as properties of the external world independent of each other, they are now seen to be merely aspects of the basic and primary property, space-time."
5031,引用明何夫斯基（Minkowski)的话说就是：“我想向你们介绍的空间和时间观念，已经从实验物理学的沃土中抽出枝芽，而它的力量亦正蕴藏于其中。它正在迅猛成长。,"To quote Minkowski: ""The views of space and time which I wish to lay before you have sprung from the soil of experimental physics, and therein lies their strength.They are radical."
5032,控制可以描述为：“对递归的非线性系统模式的阐释”（Harries-Jones 1995: 3）。,"Cybernetics might be described as: the ‘elucidating of patterns in recursive, nonlinear systems’ (Harries-Jones 1995:3)."
5032,更一般地看待世界的模式特征：想象之间的关联与事物之间的关系；关联的模式与那些从环境上看似乎并不存在关联的生活和经历的氛围有关，且最终与那些最初看上去毫无关联的现象的存在相关。,"More generally it deals with the patterned nature of the world: with the connectedness of phenomena and the connections between things; with the way patterns of connectedness both relate spheres of life and experience that might circumstantially seem unrelated, and are ultimately responsible for the existence of those seemingly unrelated phenomena in the first place."
5032,怀特海德（Whitehead 1925）相当深入地讨论了控制：本世纪以来一个错误的观念一直困扰着哲学文献，即“独立存在”。,Cybernetics takes seriously Whitehead’s counsel (1925): The misconception that has haunted philosophical literature throughout the centuries is the notion of ‘independent existence’.
5032,没有这种模式的存在；每一事物都必须和宇宙中其他事物联系起来加以理解。,There is no such mode of existence; every entity is to be understood in terms of the way it is interwoven with the rest of the universe.
5032,控制是关于世界的线路图，以及怎样才能更好地位了人类社会及其与自然环境的关系的未来充分认识并维持这一线路图。,"Cybernetics is the elucidation of the circuitry of the world, and how that circuitry can best be appreciated and maintained for the future existence both of human societies and their relation to the natural environment."
5033,另一种重要的分析言语的人类学方法来自罗伯特·潘恩（等人）关于政治口号的讨论。,Another important anthropological approach to discourse has been the work of Robert Paine (and others) on political rhetoric.
5033,潘恩把口号当作一种特殊的话语类型，认为虽然大多数的言语行动都是“言之有物”的，但口号的核心在于“说就是做”（Paine 1981:9)。,"Paine distinguishes rhetoric as a particular kind of discourse, arguing that while most speech-acts concern ""speech about something"", the kernel of rhetoric is that ""saying is doing"" (1981:9)."
5033,这时，口号往往伴有音乐或戏剧化表演，因为此时所做的与效果密不可分。,"In this, rhetoric most resembles music or drama, for there too the doing and the effect are inseparable."
5034,口头艺术包括叙事、戏剧、诗歌、咒语、谚语、谜语和文字游戏，甚至还有取名的程序、赞美和侮辱——只要它们具有特定的结构形式。,"The verbal arts include narratives, dramas, poetry, incantations, proverbs, riddles, word games, and even naming procedures, compliments, and insults, when these take structured and special forms."
5034,叙事似乎是最容记录和搜集的一种口头艺术。,Narratives seem to be one of the easiest kinds of verbal arts to record or collect.
5034,也许因为它们也是最适于公开发行的一种口头艺术而且在北美文化中最受欢迎，所以它们得到大量研究和关注。,"Perhaps because they also are the most publishable, with popular appeal in North American culture, they have received the most study and attention."
5034,一般而言，叙事分为三个基本的再出现的类别：神话，传奇和故事。,"Generally, narratives have been divided into three basic and recurring categories: myth, legend, and tale."
5035,马林诺夫斯基最著名的作品是《西太平洋的航海者》（Malinowski 1922)。,The most famous of Malinowski’s works is Argonauts of the Western Pacific (1922).
5035,该书以陈述主题、方法和范围开篇，接着描述特罗布里恩德群岛地理状况以及作者怎样到达这个群岛。,"Argonauts begins with a statement on subject, method, and scope, then describes the geography of the Trobriands and his arrival in the islands."
5035,随后他转向描述库拉（kula)交换规则，以及有关独木舟、航海以及独木舟巫术和典礼仪式的详情。,"He moves on to the rules of kula exchange, facts about canoes, sailing, and canoe magic and ceremony."
5036,夸富宴在夸扣特尔人群体和他们的邻居中很流行，这些人是富裕的猎人和渔民，他们所在的社会比起以这种方式谋生的其他社会，更加等级化一些。,"The potlatch was practised by Kwakiutl groups and their neighbours.These peoples were prosperous hunters and fisherfolk, and lived in more hierarchical societies than is common among groups with this kind of livelihood."
5036,这一系统中的贵族需要不断地捍卫并试图提高他们的相对等级，其方式是相互赠送炫耀性的礼物。,"The aristocrats within the system continuously had to defend, and to try to improve, their relative rank by giving spectacular gifts to each other."
5036,这种现象可以被描述成具有竞争性的礼物交换，包含了一种加速的机制。,"This phenomenon, which could be described as competitive gift exchange, contains a mechanism for acceleration."
5036,当B首领从A首领那里收到一份礼物，他在回赠礼物的时候就会超越后者。,"When chief B received a gift from chief A, he would have to surpass the latter in his return gift."
5036,在某些情况下，这种竞争达到顶峰的时候会毁掉大量的物质财富。,"This competition could, in some cases, culminate in the destruction of considerable material wealth."
5036,每个冬天，首领们互相邀请参加各自的大型盛会，盛会上会提供丰盛的食物和饮料，还会给客人们赠送奢侈的礼物。,"Each winter the chiefs invited each other to large parties, where abundant food and drink were served and lavish presents were given to the guests."
5037,对实现世界政治统一的抵制力量，在某种程度上似乎被跨国公司的兴起抵消了。,"The world's resistance to political integration seems to be offset, at least partially, by the rise of multinational corporations."
5037,因为这些公司跨越了国界，它们是推进全球整合的力量，尽管有各种政治差异把人们分开。,"Because these cur across the boundaries berween states, they are a force for global unity despite the political differences that divide people."
5037,人类学家非常熟悉这种情形，就像下面这段对祖尼印第安人整合机制的描述那样：四五个不同层面的系统相互交织，因而维持了整个社会的统一性，如果这些不同层面相互駐合的话，这种统一性很快就会消失，因而很有可能带来隔离和分裂宗族、兄弟互助会、祭司群体、地下大会堂，在某种意义上还有赌博团伙，都是分化机构。,"Situations such as this are well known to anthropologists, as illustrated by this description of Zuni Indian integrative mechanisms: segregation and fission.The clans, the fraternities, the priesthoods, the kivas, in a measure the gaming parties, are ail dividing agencies."
5037,如果它们相互一致的话，社会结构十的裂缝就会很深；通过彼此相互交织，它们制造出各种分支，这些分支造成了一种几乎不可思议的复杂性，但却绝不会导致这个民族实体的分裂。,"If they coincided, the rifts in the social structure would be deep; by countering each other they cause segmentations which produce an almost marvelous complexity, but can never break apart the national entity."
5038,塞罗尼-龙 (Cerroni-Long l999)说，时代要求人类学家主动地去制止各种形式的“文化福音主义”带来的危险。,"As Cerroni-Long argues (1999), times demand that anthropologists actively counteract the dangers of ""cultural fundamentalism"", in all its colours and practices."
5038,在这种氛围下的多元文化主义、跨文化主义、跨民族主义也是一样需要警惕的。,"Multi-culturalism, transculturalism, transnationalism are phrases in the air, so to speak."
5038,人类学的力量在于我们提倡多元视角主义（perspectivism):综合了殖民话语与后殖民话语，以及各种潜在的活跃的颠覆二者的力暈。,"The strength of anthropology is that we appreciate multi-perspectivism: there are a multiplicity of colonial discourses and post-colonial ones, and a plurality of potential and active subversions of both."
5038,我们能够认到宇宙的多样性才是人类学真正的成就。,Our recognition of this universe of pluralities is surely anthropology's real competence.
5039,P.R.桑迪(Sanday，P.R.,"Sanday, P. R. (1981)."
5039,，1981):《女性权利与男性统治：论性别不平等的起源》 （Female power and male dominance: On the origins of sexual inequality) 剑桥市：剑桥大学出版社。,Female power and male dominance： On the origins of sexual inequality.
5039,在这项跨文化研究中，桑迪教授揭示了人类社会组织男女关系的各种方式，并说明男性统治并非内在于那些关系之中。,"Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.In this cross-cultural study, Professor Sanday reveals the various ways male-female relations are organized in human societies and demonstrates that male dominance is not inherent in those relations."
5039,相反，它似乎倒更像是由于长期食物短缺、迁徙和殖民统治等所引起的紧张局势的产物。,"Rather, it appears to emerge in situations of stress as a result of such things as chronic food shortages, migration, and colonial domination."
5040,下一步是查看词素是如何组合起来组成短语或句子的。,The next step is to put morphemes together to form phrases or sentences.
5040,这一过程通常被叫作识别语言的句法单位，或词素组合成有意义的语符链或语符列的方式。,"This process is known as identifying the syntactic units of the language, or the way morphemes are combined into larger chains or strings that have meaning."
5040,做这件事的一种途径楚使用被称为框架替换（frame substitution）的方法。,One way to do this is to use a method called frame substitution.
5040,起初慢慢地表达词素并依靠指点或手势，田野工作者能够推导山这类语符列“我的猫”、“你的猫”，或“她的猫”，以及“我看到你的猫”，“她看到我的猫'这就开始确立短语和句子形成的规则或原理，即语言的句这种研究的进一步成就极为依赖个人的创造力、机敏、逻辑和在语言方面的经验。,"By proceeding slowly at first, and relying on pointing or gestures, the field linguist can elicit strings such as my cat, your cat, or her cat.I see your cat and she sees my cat.This begins to establish the rules or principles of phrase and sentence making, the syntax of the language."
5041,在北美，核心家庭并非总是拥有它们随着工业主义的兴起而曾经拥有过的那种程度的独立性，在早些时候一个更加农业化的时代，小型的核心家庭有时是一个较大的扩大家庭（extended family）的一部分。,"In North America, nuclear families have not always had the degree of independence they came to have with the rise of industrialism.In an earlier more agrarian era, the small nuclear family commonly was part of a larger extended family."
5041,送种家庭，部分是配偶家庭，部分是血亲家庭，它可能包括祖父母、父母、兄弟姐妹，也许还有伯(叔)和姑（婶），以及一二个堂兄弟姐妹。,"This kind of family, in part conjugal and in part consanguine, might include grandparents, mother and father, brothers and sisters, perhaps an uncle and aunt, and a stray cousin or two."
5041,所有这些人，他们或有血缘联系，或有婚姻联系，都在一起劳动和生活。,"All these people, some related by blood and some by marriage, lived and worked together."
5041,因为年轻一代的家庭成员把自己的配偶（丈夫或妻子）带回家来生活。扩大家庭就像血亲家庭一样具有时间上的延续性。,"Because members of the younger generation brought their spouses (husbands or wives) to live in the family, extended families, like consanguine families, had continuity through time."
5041,较老的家庭成员相继去世，同样，新的成员出生进入这个家庭。,"As older members died off, new members were born into the family."
5042,拉马克相信，生物体器官的进 化或退化是根据它们是否使用了其潜能而决定的。,Lamarck believed that organs improve or decay according to whether they are used to their potential or not.
5042,他还主张，个体 获得的特性能够再传递给其后代。,He also held that individuals acquired characteristics which could be passed on to their descendants.
5042,比如，一个幼时学过绘画的女孩， 能够将这种天赋传给她在子宫里的孩子。,"For example, if a girl learned to paint at an early age, later she could pass on such talents to her children in the womb."
5042,坦白地说，拉马克具有进化论思想，但他对进化机制有所误解。,"Plainly, Lamarck had the idea of evolution, but he misunderstood its mechanism."
5042,查尔斯•达尔文（Darwin 1859)拒绝接受拉马克的观点。,Charles Darwin (1859) rejected the Lamarckian view.
5042,他则主张，进化只能通过遗传我们现在所称的遗传特性来实现。,He argued instead that evolution proceeds only through the passing down of what we now call genetic traits.
5042,偶然的突变将产生更大量的变种，而且在各自的环境中最成功地生存下来的那些变种将更有效地繁衍后代。,"Accidental mutation produced greater variety, and the forms which were most successful in their respective environments would reproduce more effciently."
5043,1848年失败的“大的”泛德意志革命到1871年“小的”由普鲁士完成的德国统一之间的政治期是民俗研究(Volkskunde；folklore studies)独立出现的大环境——也就是说，与后来民族学（Völkerkunde Ethnology/Ethnogrphy)分离。在某种意义上，这是对先前转向“双重内省”趋势的逻辑继承。这一内省在1830年代从哲学和艺术浪漫主义以及政治民族主义那里获得了新的能量。,"The political period between the failed, 1848 ""large"" pan-Germanic revolution and the 1871 ""small"" Prussian unification ofGermany was the wider context for the separate emergence of Volkskunde, or folklore studies—separate, that is,from what became Völkerkunde,or ethnology/ethnography.In a sense, this was a logical continuation of the earlier turn toward a ""twofold introspection,"" which by the 1830s had received new energy from philosophical and artistic Romanticism and from political nationalism."
5044,人类学说明中的描述部分通常接近于当地人对世界的概念化，而一个主要的挑战在于把当地的观念转译为人类学家的工作语言。,"The descriptive aspect of an anthropological account is usually close to the native conceptualisation of the world, and a major challenge lies in translating native concepts into the anthropologist's working language."
5044,当描述一个社会和文化的生命世界时，人类学家常常诉诸对受访者的直接引用，按其从内部所显示的那样给出对世界的说明。,"When describing a social and cultural life-world, the anthropologist will often resort to direct quotations from informants, to give an account of the world as it appears from within."
5044,另一方面，分析，通过人类学的比较术语的描述，力图从理论层次上把该社会与其他社会相联系，这样，也就是说，用这个社会本身不存在的概念去描述这个社会：这里的人民有哪一种“亲属制度”？,"The analysis, on the other hand, will try to connect the society, at a theoretical level, to other societies by describing it in the comparative terms of anthropology.It will, in other words, describe the society with concepts which do not exist in the society itself.What kind of ""kinship system"" do the people have?"
5044,他们如何解决“冲突”？,"How do they resolve ""conflicts""?"
5044,“男女之间的劳动分工”是什么样的？,"What is the ""division of labour between men and women""?"
5044,“宗教和仪式”的作用是什么？,"What is the role of ""religion and rituals""?"
5044,“权力关系”是怎样的结构？,"How are ""power relations"" structured?"
5045,多贡的村落也是按照家系团结起来的，而不是按照纯粹的政治和司法系统。,The Dogon villages are also integrated along lines other than purely political and judicial ones.
5045,所有成年男性都参加的宗教崇拜意义重大，人们认为建立和培育历史延续感很重要。村子的所有家系都可以溯根到一个遥远的祖先，据称是他发现了他们现在的定居点。,"The religious cults, in which all adult men participate, are significant.It is considered important to establish and nurture a sense of continuity with the past, and all lineages of a village can refer to a distant ancestor who allegedly founded their current settlement."
5045,土地被认为是祖先所有，所以不能买卖。,The soil is spoken of as ancestral land and it cannot be sold.
5045,这样，多贡的村落十分稳定。,"In this way, the Dogon villages become very stable."
5045,迁入或移出的移居传统上讲都是不寻常的。,In- and out-migration have traditionally been uncommon.
5045,这种模式在许多非洲农业民族当中得以蔓延，但是在20世纪，特别是第二次世界大战期间，情况发生了变化，主要是因为殖民主义、国家教育系统的发展和资本主义劳动力市场。,"This pattern has been widespread among many African agricultural peoples, but during the twentieth century, and particularly since the Second World War, it has changed, largely due to colonialism and the growth of a state educational system and a capitalist labour market."
5046,在大学博物馆，展示是按进化方式安排的，顺着墙壁一字排开，从细胞到类人猿到人类。,"In the University Museum, displays are arranged in an evolutionary format.Along one wall is the sequence from cell to primate to humans."
5046,其他展示也详尽地阐述了这一体系，虽然并不总是那么直接；按照典型的博物馆风尚，他们展示了各种各样的动物骨骼，甚至是一名被判决的当地罪犯的骨骼。,"Other displays elaborate this scheme, though not always explicitly; in characteristic museum fashion, they display skeletons of various animals and even the skeleton of a local criminal who was executed."
5046,在这个博物馆，同样是在皮特河部分，还包栝一些文化上的手工艺术品：乐器、武器、工具和一些非常大的对象，例如大型（完整尺寸）的当地船和爱德华·泰勒爵士收集的一个巨大的图腾柱。,"In this museum, too, is the Pitt-Rivers section, which contains cultural artifacts: musical instruments, weapons, tools, and some very large objects such as full-sized native ships and a huge totem pole collected by Sir Edward Tylor."
5047,在确立了一种社会模式类型学后，道格拉斯展示了经验和文化怎样与每个类型相关。,"Having established a typology of social patterns, Douglas then shows how experiences and cultures correlate with each type."
5047,强群体一强网格社区会集结那些能够巩固信仰和凝聚社会的仪式，与其相对，弱群体一弱网格社区（如果可以这样使用这个词的话）就无法做到这一点。,"The strong group-strong grid community musters rituals that fortify faith and solidify society, whereas the weak group-weak grid community (if one may use the word) cannot."
5047,强群体一弱网格社会，着重强调像巫术和魔术这样能在客体身上展示出一种很强的社会界限感的实践；生活在这种社会的成员，会担心那些跨越界限、危害身体的讨厌的事物。,Strong group-weak grid societies emphasize such practices as witchcraft and sorcery that project a strong sense of social boundary onto the physical body; members of such societies worry about noxious substances crossing those boundaries and harming the body.
5048,穆布提人以大约20人的规模群居，具有一种分类的亲属制度，即同样的亲属称谓被用来表示不同的（或根本没有）生物关系的个体。,"The Mbuti live in groups numbering about 20 persons and have a classificatory kinship system, which means that the same kinship terms are used to denote individuals who are differently (or not at all) biologically related."
5048,等级由性别、年龄和个人威望决定，生命阶段的转换由详细的过渡仪式（rite of passage）来标志。,"Rank is determined according to gender, age and personal authority, and the transition between life-stages is marked by elaborate rites of passage."
5048,婚礼也是重要的仪式，离婚是不被赞成的。,Weddings are also important rituals and divorce is discouraged.
5048,尽管婚外性行为会有发生，但却是不被批准的，调情的行为面临严格的约束。,"Although non-marital sex occurs, it is negatively sanctioned.Flirtation is subjected to strict rules."
5049,与深受现代英美传统影响的多数社会科学家欢迎的这一对人类行为的解释相对比，普遍主义者更倾向于另一种观点。,"In contrast to the kind of explanation of human behavior favored by most social scientists of the modern Anglo-American tradition, universalists would favor another viewpoint."
5049,一种英美传统（经验主义）争辩说，人类具有如此大的可塑性，以至于可以将其思维方式和行动解释为主要是对其所处环境的反应。,"One Anglo-American tradition, known as empiricism, has argued that humans are so plastic that their ways of thinking and acting are explicable primarily as responses to their environment."
5049,普遍主义者追随一种叫作理性主义的哲学，后者假设人的心智有固定的分类，不管在什么样的环境下都会显露出来。,"Universalists follow a philosophy known as rationalism, which postulates that the human mind has innate categories, which surface regardless of the environment."
5049,然后，人类学与其他领域的认知科学一道，寻求发现人类思想的普遍特征 。,"Anthropology, then, together with cognitive sciences in other fields, seeks to discover universal qualities of human thought."
5050,作为对列维-斯特劳斯观察的补充，我们必须指出的是，西方曾有自己的食人行为，原因则和美洲土著的十分相似。,"As a postscript to Lévi-Strauss’s observations, we might add that the West has a history of its own anthropophagic practices, the reasoning for which being very similar to those of indigenous peoples of the Americas, i."
5050,例如，他们恢复和获得健康！,e.that they revitalize and give health!
5050,西方医学有很长医学食人历史。特别是在16、17世纪帕拉塞斯式医药哲学盛行时。,"Medicinal cannibalism in Western medicine has a long history, and was especially popular in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries when Paracelsian medical philosophy was followed."
5051,民族志是新出现的跨学科现象。,Ethnography is an emergent interdisciplinary phenomenon.
5051,它的权威和修辞已扩展到许多把“文化”当作描述和批评的新的问题对象的领域。,"Its authority and rhetoric have spread to many fields where ""culture"" is a newly problematic object of description and critique."
5051,本书虽然从田野调査及其文本开始，但向更宽广的写作实践开放：关于文化、相对于文化以及在文化之间的写作。,"The present book, though beginning with fieldwork and its texts, opens onto the wider practice of writing about, against, and among cultures."
5051,这一模糊的范围包括——这里只提-些发展中的视角——历史民族志（伊曼纽尔˙勒˙罗伊˙拉迪里，纳塔莉˙戴维斯，卡洛˙金斯伯格）、文化政治学（斯蒂芬˙格林布拉特）文化批评(海登˙怀特，爱德华˙萨义德，弗雷德里克˙詹明信）、对日常实践和隐形知识的分析（皮埃尔˙布迪尔，米歇尔˙德˙塞尔托）、情感的霸权结构的批评（雷蒙德˙威廉斯）、对科学团体的研究 (迪随托马斯˙库恩）、异想世界与奇幻空间的符号学（茨韦坦˙托多罗夫，路易˙马兰）以及所有聚焦于意义系统、有争议的传统或文化造物的研究。,"This blurred purview includes, to name only a few developing perspectives, historical ethnography (Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, Natalie Davis, Carlo Ginzburg), cultural poetics (Stephen Greenblatt), cultural criticism (Hayden White, Edward Said, Fredric Jameson), the analysis of implicit knowledge and everyday practices (Pierre Bourdieu, Michel de Certeau), the critique of hegemonic structures of feeling (Raymond Williams), the study of scientific communities (following Thomas Kuhn), the semiotics of exotic worlds and fantastic spaces (Tzvetan Todorov, Louis Marin), and all those studies that focus on meaning systems, disputed traditions, or cultural artifacts."
5052,历史人类学发展了它在博物馆中的一个强项，地方专业知识和档案材料促进了对写作历史的臆测性方法更早的超越，而在这方面又与德语区中来自启蒙时期的重要语言学学统结合得非常好。,"Historical anthropology developed one of its strongholds in museums, where regional expertise and archival material promoted an earlier transcending of the speculative methods of writing history.This combined well with the important philological legacy in German, derived from Enlightenment."
5052,德语学术圈中的人文学科被赋予了来自这一语言学学统的丰富的专业院系：日本、中国、印度和西藏研究；阿拉伯、土耳其和伊朗研究；等等。,"The humanities in German-speaking academia are richly endowed with specialized departments that come out of this philological tradition: Japanese, Chinese, Indian, and Tibetan studies; Arab, Turkish, and Iranian studies; and so on."
5052,尽管某种程度上还遭受到被萨义德（1979)批判的东方学的局限的影响，这些传统和研究记录经历了自身的改革，并在越来越多地刺激历史人类学发展的同时也被后者所影响。,"Although still suffering to some degree from Orientalist limitations of the kind criticized by Edward Said (1979), these traditions and research records went through reforms of their own, while increasingly stimulating historical anthropology and being influenced by it."
5052,尤其是，地区专业化和历史 专业知识的质量在关于南北美洲的土著人、撒哈拉以南的非洲、中东、西伯利亚、东南亚和美拉尼西亚的研究中都达到了新的水平。,"In particular, regional specialization and historical expertise gained new levels of quality for native South and North America, Africa south of the Sahara, the Middle East, Siberia, Southeast Asia, and Melanesia."
5053,为了反击泰勒、摩根和其他人的进化论的宏大架构，博厄斯早期采取了一种更倾向排他主义研究者的姿态。,"Reacting against the grand evolutionary schemes of Tylor, Morgan and others, Boas took an early stance in favour of a more particularist approach."
5053,他认为，每一种文化都应该从其自身角度被理解，如果以西方种族中心主义的类型学的“发展水平”为评估标准，将会从科学上误入歧途，对其他文化做出错误的判断和排序。,"He argued that each culture had to be understood on its own terms and that it would be scientifically misleading to judge and rank other cultures according to a Western, ethnocentric typology gauging ""levels of development""."
5053,相应地，博厄斯也推崇历史特殊论，其观点是所有社会和文化都有它们自己独特的历史，而不能被简化成是某个普遍性发展方案中的一个类别。,"Accordingly, Boas also promoted historical particularism, the view that all societies or cultures had their own, unique history that could not be reduced to a category in some universalist scheme of development."
5053,基于相关原因，博厄斯反驳了种族主义伪科学毫无根据的宣称， 尽管当时这种种族主义伪科学被许多重要的生物学家所支持。,"On related grounds, Boas argued against the unfounded claims of racist pseudo-science, which were supported by most of the leading biologists of the time."
5054,“自由阐释的历史”是赫伯特•巴特菲尔德爵士提出的一个措词。1931年前后，他指出，历史学家也总是都常常会把历史视为一种变革论者和保守论者之间的冲突，变革论者（自由主义者）最终赢得并带来了影响目前情境的变化。,"‘Whig history’ is a phrase coined by Sir Herbert Butterfield around 1931, when he said that historians have all too often seen history as a conflict between progressives and reactionaries, where the progressives (Whigs) eventually win and bring about changes effecting the present situation."
5054,自由阐释的历史因此是主观的和“现代主义的” （presentist)，而这就是为什么历史学家不喜欢它的原因。,"Whig history is thus subjective and ‘presentist’, and that is why true historians do not like it (see, e.g."
5054,他们说，好的历史是“历史性的”（historicist)，要有一种非常精确的世界感。,", Stocking 1968 [1965]: 1-12).Good history, they say, is ‘historicist’, in a very precise sense of that word."
5055,在当代北美社会，一种越来越普遍的婚姻形式是连续一夫一妻制(serial monogamy)，在这种婚姻形式中，男子或女子连续与一系列配偶结婚。,"A form of marriage increasingly common in North American society today is serial monogamy, whereby the man or the woman marries or lives with a series of partners in succession."
5055,当前，50%以上的初次婚姻以离婚告终，而且某些专家推断，新近的婚姻有三分之二将不会持久。,"Currently, more than 50% of first marriages end in divorce, and some experts project that two thirds of recent marriages will not last."
5055,婚姻破裂后，孩子经常不同母亲一起生活。,"[Stacey, J. (1990). Brave new families (pp. 15, 286, n. 46). New York： Basic Books.] Upon dissolution of a marriage, the children more often than not remain with the mother."
5055,这一模式与社会学家和人类学家最初描述美国西部印第安人和低阶层都市美国黑人的那种模式类似。,This pattern is an outgrowth of one sociologists and anthropologists first described among West Indians and lower-class urban blacks in the United States.
5055,女子早年就开始生孩子，那个令他怀孕的男子没有跟她结婚。,"Early in life, women begin to bear children by men who are not married to them."
5055,为了供养她们自己及其孩子，妇女必须在家庭之外寻找工作，但要这样做，她们必须寻求其他亲戚的帮助，最经常的帮助来自她们的母亲。,"To support themselves and their children, the women must look for work outside the household, but to do so they must seek help from other kin, most commonly their mother."
5056,在核心家庭发展循环的早期阶段，家户因此简直是不能成立的。,"At the early stage of the developmental cycle of the nuclear family, the household is thus only barely viable."
5056,这样的家户常常是与男方父亲的家户暂时合并在一起，直到他们的长子到了可以放牧的年龄。,"Frequently such a household will temporarily merge with that of the man's father, until his oldest son is able to work as a shepherd."
5056,在旱季，这种与丈夫父亲的家户联盟可能是特别重要的，在这个阶段，富拉尼人散布在一大片区域；到了雨季，他们以大型家族集团的形式居住在一起，从而更好地协同工作。,"Such an alliance with the husband's fathe's household can be especially important during the dry season.During this period, the Fulani are scattered over a large area; during the rainy season, they live in larger kin groups and can more easily share the work."
5057,其他形式的继嗣群体是联族和半偶族（参见图10.3)。,Other kinds of descent group are phratries and moieties (Figure 10.3).
5057,联族(phratry)，如我们前面讨论过的霍皮人联族那样，是由至少两个氏族构成的单系继嗣群体，这两个氏族之间假设拥有个共同祖先，而不论是否真的如此。,"A phratry, such as those of the Hopi we already have discussed, is a unilineal descent group composed of at least two clans that supposedly share a common ancestry, whether or not they really do."
5057,和氏族中的个体一样，联族的成员也不能精辦地把他们的继嗣关系追溯到一个共同的祖先，尽管他们坚定地相信有这个袓先存在。,"Like clan individuals, phratry members cannot trace accurately their descent links to a common ancestor, though they firmly believe such an ancestor existed."
5058,人们在不同时期已提出財乱伦禁忌的各种心理学解释。,Various psychological explanations of the incest taboo have been advanced at one time or another.
5058,西格蒙特·弗洛伊德在他对无意识的精神分析理论中试图说明其原因。,Sigmund Freud tried to account for it in his psychoanalytic theory of the unconscious.
5058,按照弗洛伊德的看法，儿子对母亲有情欲（熟悉酿成尝试），造成与父亲的对抗关系（弗洛伊德称之为恋母情结）。,"According to him, the son desires the mother (familiarity breeds attempt), creating a rivalry with the father.(Freud called this the Oedipus complex.)"
5058,儿子必须压抑这种感情，否则就激起远比他强有力的父亲的愤怒。,"The son must suppress these feelings or earn the wrath of the father, who is far more powerful than he."
5058,同样，女儿迷上父亲，即恋父情结，使她与其母亲处在对抗关系之中根据这一观点，我们可以预计，就家庭内杀人者而言可能发生同性偏见——母亲对女儿或儿子对父亲——但事实上，这种偏见并不存在。,"Similarly, the attraction of the daughter to the father (the Electra complex) places her in rivalry with her mother.From this, we might expect a same-sex bias in the case of intrafamily homicides—mother versus daughter or son versus father—but in fact no such bias exists."
5059,良知时常被认为是人类自我之最深层的、隐私性的个人特征。,"One's conscience is often thought to be the most intimate, personal and private characteristic of one's ego."
5059,如果人们想去寻找某些完全属于自己的、由个人始终如一地拥有的东西，那么，这里就正是这样一块地方。,"Here if anywhere one ought to find something that is wholly one's own, a private and unique possession."
5059,对一个普通人来说，这种良知似乎就是分辨是非的机制和先天能力，正如他具有分辨上和下、垂直与平行的机制一样。,"To an ordinary individual the conscience seems to be a mechanism, an inborn ability, to distinguish between right and wrong, just as he possesses a mechanism for distinguishing up from down, the vertical from the horizontal."
5060,随着时间流逝，世系群代代相传，新成员不断降生，其成员可能太多而难以管理，或因人数太多以至于该世系群的资源难以供养他们。,"In the course of time, as generation succeeds generation and new members are born into the lineage, its membership may become unmanageably large or too much for the lineage's resources to support."
5060,每当这种情况发生，就如我们在中国人宗族那里看到的那样，裂变（fission）便产生了，这就是说，原先的世系群分裂成新的、比较小的世系群。,"When this happens, as we have seen with the Chinese tsu, fission occurs; that is, the lineage Small Places， Large Issuests into new, smaller lineages."
5060,每巧这种情况发生，通常新世系群的成员会继续承认它们彼此之间最终的联系。,"When fission occurs, usually the members of the new lineages continue to recognize their ultimate relationship to one another."
5060,这一过程的结果是产生一种更大型的继嗣群体：氏族这个术语，及其近义词血统宗族，人类学家对其有不同用法，它们的含义在一定程度上是模糊不清的。,"The result of this process is the appearance of a second kind of descent group, the clan.The term clan and its close relative, the term sib, have been used differently by various anthropologists, and a certain amount of confusion exists about their meaning."
5061,这些例子决没有穷尽在卡保库人文化中存在的各种相互关系。,These examples by no means exhaust the interrelationships found in Kapauku culture.
5061,例如，通过男子计算世系和几乎不断的战争往往增进男子的统治，因而在卡保库人社会，发现男子独占领袖地位，占有妇女的劳动产品以进行其政治“博弈”，也就不令人惊讶了。,"For example, both patrilineality and endemic warfare tend to promote male dominance, so it is not surprising to find that positions of leadership in Kapauku society are held exclusively by men, who appropriate the products of women's labor in order to play their political ""games""."
5061,尽管有相反的断言，男性统治绝不是所有人类社会的特征。,"Assertions to the contrary notwithstanding, male dominance is by no means characteristic of all human societies."
5061,相反，就如在卡保库人 的案例中，它也只是在那特殊环境下才产生的，如果那种环境变化了，男女相互关系的方式也将会改变。,"Rather, as with the Kapauku, it arises only under particular circumstances that, if changed, would alter the way men and women relate to one another."
5062,由于工业化和民族国家对大量异质化人口进行的整合，保留基于宗族或家系的社会组织在许多情况下都变得不可能。,"Due to industrialisation and the integration of large, heterogeneous populations in nation-states, it has in many contexts become impossible to maintain clan- or lineage-based social organisation."
5062,在这种社会里，每个人都要依靠大量与自己没有关系的人，而且每个人都要对自己的生活负责，很大程度上是没有来自家族群体的支持的。,"In this kind of society, everybody is dependent on a large number of persons they are not related to, and each person is responsible for his or her life, largely without support from the kin group."
5062,劳动合同代替了宗族土地和家庭交易，并且社会流动性很强。,"The labour contract has replaced the clan land and the family trade, and social mobility is high."
5062,婚姻的思维方式以个体选择为基础，取代了之前基于家系的婚姻模式。,A marriage ideology based on individual choice has replaced the former lineage-based marriages.
5062,货币经济和普遍的工薪式思维方式将居住地点和生存的问题变成个人而非集体的问题。,The monetary economy and the ideology of universal wagework has turned questions of subsistence and place of residence into individual and not collective issues.
5062,这些可能会使我们相信亲属制度不再重要了。,This may lead us to believe that kinship has ceased to be important.
5062,但是，在其社会组织的潜力之外，它还具有重要的象征维度。,"However, it has important symbolic dimensions in addition to its social organisational potential."
5063,《撒旦的诗篇》（The Satanic Verses，Rushdie 1988）这部小说给它的作者从德黑兰的什叶派牧师那里招来了追杀之祸（fatwa），也就是死刑。这本书从根本上说不是一本关于伊斯兰教的书，而是关于流亡的一种状态；关于在孟买与伦敦之间的印度航空公司420航线的中途一永久地。,"The Satanic Verses (Rushdie 1988), the novel which earned its author a fatwa, or death penalty, from Shi'ite priests in Teheran, is not primarily a book about Islam.Rather, it is about the condition of exile; about being on Air India's Flight 420 halfway between Bombay and London – permanently."
5063,在书中，拉什迪显示了流亡生活所带来的视角的转变如何引发怀疑和不确定感，因为流亡的人发现，当从不同的位置进行审视时，世界、历史和（最终）甚至真理都显得不同了。,"In the book, Rushdie shows how the shift in perspective entailed by exile creates doubt and uncertainty, because the person in exile discovers that the world, the past and (ultimately) even the truth appear differently when viewed from different positions."
5063,移民群体中的种族复兴可以从这个视角加以理解，利用乡愁和一种疏离感，这些复兴行动设法重新灌输一种对过去的延续感、本体论的安全感（Giddens 1990）和个体的安全感。,"Ethnic revitalisation among migrant groups may be understood within this perspective.Drawing on nostalgia and a sense of alienation, such movements contrive to re-instil a sense of continuity with the past, ontological security (Giddens 1990) and personal security."
5064,用功能主义的方法进行研究的主要代表人物是马克斯·格拉克曼（Max Gluckman 1963b）。,The functionalist approach is exemplified by Max Gluckman (1963b).
5064,他说，流言蜚语是一个由文化决定并进行传递的过程，是一种社会事实，具有约定俗成的规则和重要的功能。,"Gossip, Gluckman begins, is a culturally determined and sanctioned process, a social fact, with customary rules and with important functions."
5064,值得注意的是，流言蜚语有助于维系群体的统一、道德和历史。,"Notably, gossip helps maintain group unity, morality and history."
5065,要是你探究特罗布里恩德岛民的事务，你就会发现……当地人对违背外婚制规則的观念的恐惧，他们相信疼痛、疾病、甚至死亡是氏族乱伦的必然结果。,"If you were to inquire into the matter among the Trobrianders, you would find that ...the natives show horror at the idea of violating the rules of exogamy and that they believe that sores, diseases, even death might follow clan incest."
5065,[但是]从当地人的放荡不羁者的观点看，suvasova(违犯外婚制）确实是特有趣味的而且是痛快的性经验形式。,"[But] from the viewpoint of the native libertine, suvasova (the breach of exogamy) is indeed a specially interesting and spicy form of erotic experience."
5065,我的大部分知情人不仅承认而且确实夸耀自己犯了这一过错。,Most of my informants would not only admit but did actually boast about having committed this offense.
5066,在有些社会，乱伦禁忌只在特殊情形下被禁止。,"In some societies, the incest taboo is suspended under special circumstances."
5066,例如，在埃及人和夏威夷人中，兄弟姐妹婚姻在皇族中是允许的，这显然是考虑到只有皇族足够有益于皇族。,"Among the ancient Egyptians and the Hawaiians, for example, marriage of brothers to sisters was permitted among the royalty, apparently on the ground that only royalty were good enough for royalty."
5066,神话中的神经常是被允许乱伦的，显然也是出于相似的原则考虑。,"Too, the gods of mythology are often permitted incest, apparently owing to a similar principle."
5066,简而言之，人类学家可以认为乱伦禁忌在人类社会中的存在具有普遍性，但是必须对其进行精细的定义。,"In short, anthropologists can define the incest taboo as a human universal but only by careful definition."
5067,哈金提出了一个很简单的论点：当前被视为“真理”的判断所依赖的是一个先于它发生的历史事件——一种关于真理和谬误的思考方式的出现。这种思考方式建立了考察一个命题所需的条件，即这一命题首先能够被视为真或伪。,"Hacking puts forward what is basically a simple point: what is currently taken as ""truth"" is dependent on a prior historical event—the emergence of a style of thinking about truth and falsity that established the conditions for entertaining a proposition as being capable of being taken as true or false in the first place."
5067,哈金这样写道:“通过论证，我想指出的不是逻辑，而恰恰是它的反面，因为，逻辑是真理的保存方式，而一种推理的风格则带来了或真或伪的可能性……推理风格创造出真和伪的可能性。演绎和归纳仅仅保存了这些可能性”（第56—57页）。,"Hacking puts it this way: ""By reasoning I don't mean logic. I mean the very opposite, for logic is the preservation of truth, while a style of reasoning is what brings in the possibility of truth or falsehood...styles of reasoning create the possibility of truth and falsehood. Deduction and induction merely preserve it"" (56—57)."
5067,哈金并不“反对”逻辑本身，他反对的是逻辑宣称自己为一切真理得以建立的基础。,"Hacking is not ""against"" logic, only against its claims to found and ground all truth."
5067,逻辑在它自己的领域内是可靠的，但是这一领域却是有限的。,"Logic is fine in its own domain, but that domain is a limited one."
5068,一言以蔽之，世界上没有任何一个社区、国家或环境没有受到旅游业的某种程度的影响。,"In a word, there is not a community, a country, an environment in the world which tourism does not affect in some degree."
5068,有了国家政府的支持、跨国企业的推动，国家代理机构（比如世界旅游组织）的管理，加上越来越多的世界人口和每年2700亿英镑的营业额，估汁旅游业已经是世界上规模最大的国际工业。,"Sponsored by national governments, promoted by multinational enterprises, regulated by international agencies (e.g.the World Tourism Organization), engaged in by more and more of the world's population, and with an annual turnover in excess of £270 billion, it is estimated that tourism is the world's largest international industry."
5068,最近，旅游业已经被认为是人类学关注的主要概念之一。,"Latterly, tourism has also been recognized as of major conceptual concern to anthropology."
5069,特别是可溶性铝的增加，规模日趋增大。并且，人们还发现铝消费与老年性痴呆、阿兹海默症和帕金森综合征等疾病有关。,"The increase of dissolved aluminum, in particular, is becoming truly massive, and aluminum consumption has been associated with senile dementia as well as Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases."
5069,今天，这些疾病已成为美国主要的健康问题了。,"Today, these rank as major health problems in the United States."
5070,凡是出现严重分歧和尖锐对立的地方便不存在什么策略，因此博弈论的模式也就派不上用场。,"Where there is radical dissensus there is no game, and hence no applicability for games-theory models."
5070,一方正循规蹈矩地 “下棋”，而另一方却正按照“见者有份”的观念，大肆劫掠。,"One side is playing chess, the other side is playing ""for keeps."""
5070,因此我们必须透过策略和表面上的无序去探寻其内部的有序和连贯。,We must go deeper than games to find consistency and order in observed disorder.
5070,一方面，我们可以对生产力生产关系进行马克思式的分析，马克思认为生产力和生产关系将卷人其中的人这一范畴联系在一起从而形成了一个极为精密复杂的结构。,"On the one hand, we can go to the Marxist analysis of the precise structure of the productive forces and productive relations interlinking and separating the categories of human beings involved."
5071,生活在热带区域的人们常让蜂蜜引路鸟（honey guide bird）引导他们寻找野生蜜蜂的巢穴，鸟儿反过来也受益于人类提炼蜂蜜的能力。,"Human beings in tropical regions allow the honey guide bird to show them the way to wild bees' nests, and the bird in turn benefits from the human beings' ability to extract the honey."
5071,一只被工作人员教会了美国手势语的大猩猩（Gardner等 1989)也会将其所学的知识传递给它的伙伴（Fouts等 1989)。,Chimpanzees have been taught American Sign Language (Gardner et al. 1989) and have then taught it to each other (Fouts et al. 1989).
5071,我建议我们放弃任何声称文化是人类独一无二特性的企图，借此假装人类是“不同”的，并以这种方式将人类与其他动物截然分开。,"I suggest that we abandon any attempt to claim culture as a uniquely human characteristic, and with it the pretence that human beings are ""different"" in a way that sets them significantly apart from the rest of the animal kingdom."
5071,就任何物种都不同于其他物种而言，以自己的方式生存于世，并以自己特有的方式影响世界而言，人类是独特的。,"Human beings are different in the sense that any species is different from the rest, in having its own way of living in the world and its own distinctive impact on the world."
5072,它们还假定，学术体裁和文学体裁相互渗透，描述文化的写作真正是试验性和伦理性的。,They assume that academic and literary genres interpenetrate and that the writing of cultural descriptions is properly experimental and ethical.
5072,它们把焦点放 在文本生产和修辞上，以便突出文化叙述的建构和人为的性质。,"Their focus on text making and rhetoric serves to highlight the constructed, artificial nature of cultural accounts."
5072,"这种做法削弱了过度透明的权威模式，把注意力引向民族志的历史困境，亦即，民族志总是陷人发明文化而非再现文化的境地（Wagner 1975),这些文章所提问题的范围不属与任何传统意义上的文学，这一点将很快变得明显。","It undermines overly transparent modes of authority, and it draws attention to the historical predicament of ethnography, the fact that it is always caught up in the invention, not the representation, of cultures (Wagner 1975).As will soon be apparent, the range of issues raised is not literary in any traditional sense."
5072,大部分的文章虽然焦点在文本实践.然而都抵达了文本之外的语境:权力、抵抗、制度限制以及创新的语境,"Most of the essays, while focusing on textual practices, reach beyond texts to contexts of power, resistance, institutional constraint, and innovation."
5073,现代描写语言学的长处之一是其方法的客观性。,One of the strengths of modern descriptive linguistics is the objectivity of its methods.
5073,擅长这一方法的人类学家研究一门语言，不会抱有这种观念，即该语言必定有名词、动词、介词或在英语中可辨别的其他形式类。,"A descriptive linguist does not approach a language with the idea that it must have nouns, verbs, prepositions, or any other of the form classes identifiable in English."
5073,相反，他或她看到在该语言中出现的东西，而且试图根据它自己的内在作用把它描写出来。,The linguist instead sees what turns up in the language and makes an attempt to describe it in terms of its own inner workings.
5073,为方便起见，把近似于英语名词和动词表现的词素称为名词和动词，但如果有人认为那种名称会引起误解，那么它们就可能被称为 “x-词”和“y-词”，或“A形式类”和“B形式类”。,"For convenience, morphemes that behave approximately like English nouns and verbs may be labeled as such, but if the terms would be misleading, the linguist instead might call them ""x-words"", and ""y-words"", or ""form class A"" and ""form class B""."
5074,但是撇开受到强调的因素不谈，所有的亲属称谓都完成了两项重要的任务。,"But regardless of the factors emphasized, all kinship terminologies accomplish two important tasks."
5074,首先，它们把相类似的人分到同一个具体的范畴之下；第二，它们把不同类的人分到截然不同的范畴之下。,"First, they classify similar kinds of persons into specific categories; second, they separate different kinds of persons into distinct categories."
5074,一般而言，两个或更多的具有相似地位的亲属共用一个称谓，而这个称谓就突出了这些相似性。,"Generally, two or more kin are merged under the same term when the individuals share similar status, which then emphasizes these similarities."
5074,"运用上面提到的原则,就形成了六种不同的亲属称谓制度：爱斯基摩制、夏威夷制、员洛魁制、克劳制、奥马哈制以及苏丹制或者描述制，六种亲属制度中的每一种制度都根据堂表兄弟姐妹的归类方式来辨别。","Six different systems of kinship terminology result from the application of the principles mentioned: the Eskimo, Hawaiian, Iroquois, Crow, Omaha, and Sudanese or descriptive systems, each identified according to the way cousins are classified."
5075,灭绝是这样一种现象：一种文化的大部分承担者都死了，而那些幸存者变成了难民，生活在有着其他文化的民族中间。,Extinction is the phenomenon whereby so many carriers of a culture die that those who survive become refugees living among peoples of other cultures.
5075,此类例子可以在今天世界上的很多地方看到（参见图15.4）；最近的例子应该是在南美洲的很多地方和巴西的亚马逊盆地。,"Examples of this may be seen in many parts of the world today; the closest examples are found in many parts of South America, again as in Brazil's Amazon basin."
5075,一个有详细记载的案例发生在1968年，一批杀手受雇去消灭几个印第安人族群，其中包括辛塔拉加族。,"One particularly well-documented case occurred in 1968, when hired killers tried to wipe out several Indian groups, including the Cinta-Larga."
5075,为了完成这项任务，他们从轻型飞机上撒下砒霜，扔下炸药，并用机关枪扫射；至于辛塔拉加人，杀手们选在他们举行一个重要的本族仪式的时候下手去袭击一个村子，因为这个村子被他们视为发展的一个障碍。,"For this they used arsenic, dynamite, and machine guns from light planes; in the case of the Cinta-Largas, the killers chose a time when an important native ceremony was taking place to attack a village seen as an obstacle to development."
5076,人类学的研究范围非常浩大。,The scope of anthropology is vast.
5076,它会考虑文明的“发源地”、伟大的历史文明和当代生活，当然，其他领域也会考虑这些主题。,"It treats the ""cradles"" of civilization, the great historic civilizations, and contemporary life, sharing, of course, these topics with other fields."
5076,但是，人类学最独具特色的关注焦点是在这样一类群体身上，即那些默默无闻和快要绝种的群体、异国他乡的群体和小的群体。,But the most distinctive focus of anthropology is on a kind of group that at first glance seems to relegate the field to obscurity and eventual extinction: the exotic and the small.
5076,人类学想要了解最基本的人类共同体的本质。,Anthropology seeks to know the nature of the elementary human community.
5076,我们首先来看一下俗民社区。,"We shall first try to discover the category, folk community, in folklore."
5077,例如，亚芙尼亚人的写作吸收了与诡术家（trickster）形象联系在一起的哲学的、神话的和纯粹诙谐的一个悠久的传统。,"For instance, Amerindian writing draws on a long tradition of philosophical, mythic, and simply humorous engagement with trickster figures."
5077,黑人自传写作也有一个久已确立的传统，可以追溯到被带到美洲的西非穆斯林（及其他）奴隶的叙述。更直接地，在现代时期，黑人自传促进了二战后黑人民权运动的核心发展。,"Black autobiographical writing is also a long-established tradition.One can trace it back to the slave narratives of Muslim West Africans (and others) brought to America, and, more immediately in the modern period, black autobiographies contributed to the core development of the post—World War II civil rights movement."
5077,没有拉尔夫˙艾利森的《看不见的人（Ellison 1952）、克劳德˙布朗的《曼切尔德在希望之乡》（Brown 1965）、马娅˙安热卢的《我知道笼中鸟为何唱歌》（Angelou 1969）、《马尔克姆˙X自传》（Malcolm X，with Alex Haley，1973)，以及埃尔德里奇˙克利弗的《冰上的灵魂》（Cleaver 1968），黑人民权运动是难以想象的。,"That inovemenl is hard 10 conceive of without thinking of Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man (1952), Claude Brown's Manchila in the Promised Land (1965), Maya Angelou's I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1969), The Autobiography of Malcolm X (with Alex Haley, 1973), Eldridge Cleaver's Soul on Ice (1968).Chinese-American (like Mexican-American) writing has generated class-linked differential reactions."
5078,尽管通观人类的大部分历史，人们依赖神话和民间传说来问答这些问题，而不是系统地检验通过仔细观察获得的数据。,"Throughout most of their history, though, people relied on myth and folklore for their answers to these questions, rather than the systematic testing of data obtained through careful observation."
5078,在过去200年里，作为回答这些问题的科学研究的人类学已经产生。简单说来，人类学（Anthropology）是研究任何地方、任何时代人类的学科。,"Anthropology, over the past 200 years, has emerged as a scientific approach to answering these questions.Simply stated, anthropology is the study of humankind in all places and throughout time."
5078,人类学家主要感兴趣的是单个物种——智人——人类及其祖先和近亲。,"The anthropologist is concerned primarily with a single species—Homo sapiens—the human species, its ancestors, and its near relatives."
5078,因为人类学家是被研究的人类的成员，他们难于维持对其研究对象的不偏不倚的态度。,"Because anthropologists are members of the species they study, it is difficult for them to maintain a scientific detachment toward those they study."
5079,我其余的问题都以一种或另外一种方式与民族主义或民主联系在一起。,My remaining questions all relate in one way or another to the issue of nationalism and democracy.
5079,这两种思想之间关系的密切程度超过了国际主义民主人士（我应该把自己计算在这个类别中）所感觉到的舒适程度， 这一点长时间地打动着我。,It has long struck me that the connection between these two ideas is closer than most internationalist democrats (a category in which I should like to count myself) feel comfortable with.
5079,不是所有的民族主义者都是民主主义者，也不是所有的民族-国家（nation-state）都是民主治理的。,Not that all nationalists are democrats or all nation-states are democratically governed.
5080,20世纪60年代，认知人类学的支持者继承了他的传统，即关注现代西方科学和他们所研究的本土的世界观之间的关系。,"In the 1960s proponents of cognitive anthropology took up Whorf’s concern of the relation between modern, Western science and the indigenous worldviews they studied."
5080,这些支持者把自己的研究领域称之为“民族科学（ethnoscience)。,They called their field ‘ethnoscience’.
5080,"这个术语没有明确指出其与“认知人类学”（当时的一些人也确实这样看这一学科）、“成分分析”（保留了其主要的方法）或是“新田野民族志” (the new ethnography, 20世纪60年代杜撰的词，用来区分刘易斯，宾福德的“新考古学”）的不同。","That term did not always designate anything at all different from ‘cognitive anthropology’ (which was how some still saw their enterprise), from ‘componential analysis’ (which remained their main methodology), or from ‘the new ethnography’ (a catchword coined in the 1960s to make the comparison between their work and ‘the new archaeology’ of Lewis Binford)."
5081,这种观点的一致性仍然没有改变。,So far the consensus holds.
5081,但是有一点学者们是真正存在分歧的。,But there is one quite serious point on which scholars do genuinely disagree.
5081,几乎所有的民族主义者(nationalists)都将他们本民族认同(national identity)的起源追溯到近代以前的时代。,Almost all nationalists trace the origins of their own national identity far back into the pre-modern era.
5081,问题是他们这样做对吗？,"The question is, are they right to do so?"
5082,例如，人类学家可以转向考古学的或历史的资料以检验有关文化变迁的假说。,
5082,被认为因为某种特殊条件引起的文化特质，考古学可以通过研究这种条件过去事实上发生的处境对其加以检验。,Cultural characteristics thought to be caused by certain specified conditions can be tested archaeo-logically by investigating situations where such conditions actually occurred.
5082,民族史学（Ethnohistory）是一种历史民族志，通过口述历史，探险者、传教士和商人的描述，以及通过对地名、生死记录和其他档案材料的分析来研究最近的文化民族史学的文化分析——就如考古学——对理解变迁来说是有价值的研究方式。,"Also useful are data the ethnohistorian provides.Ethnohistory is a kind of historic ethnography that studies cultures of the recent past through oral histories; through the accounts of explorers, missionaries, and traders; and through the analysis of data such as land titles, birth and death records, and other archival materials.The ethnohistorical analysis of cultures, like archaeology，is a valuable approach to understanding change."
5082,通过考察被认为是引起某些现象的条件，我们可以发现这些条件是否真正先于那些现象。,"By examining the conditions be¬lieved to have caused certain phenomena, we can discover whether or not those conditions truly precede those phenomena."
5083,这一领域的理论启发，主要来自弗洛伊德的精神分析心理学和精神病学。,The theoretical inspiration for this field came mainly from the psychoanalytical psychology and psychiatry of Sigmund Freud.
5083,弗洛伊德主义重点关注儿童时期的经历，将其作为成年人个性的一个决定因素，文化和人格研究遵循这一重点集中关注儿童抚养，即将文化价值和心理性格灌输给个体的方式。,"Following the Freudian emphasis on childhood experience as a Substance determinant of the adult personality, the culture and personality studies focused especially on child rearing – the way it transmits cultural values and psychological dispositions to the individual."
5083,例如，俄国的包裹婴儿习惯，被看做是倾向于对极端情绪作出反应的一种民族性格。,"The Russian habit of swaddling, for example, was seen as reflecting and encouraging a national character prone to extremes of emotion."
5084,在传统上，人类学被划分为四个领域：体质人类学和三个文化人类学分支学科:考古学、语言人类学和民族学。,"Anthropology is traditionally divided into four fields: physical anthropology and the three branches of cultural anthropology, which are archaeology, linguistic anthropology, and ethnology."
5084,体质人类学（Physical Anthropology)主要研究作为生物有机体的人，而文化人类学（Cultural Anthropology）研究作为文化创造者的人类。,"Physical anthropology is concerned primarily with humans as biological organisms, while cultural anthropology deals with humans as cultural animals."
5084,当然，二者是相互联系的。我们若不知道人类是如何创生的，我们就 不能理解人是如何思考和行动的。,"Both, of course, are closely related; we cannot understand what people do unless we know what people are."
5084,我们想要了解生物特性焉如何影响文化，文化又是如何影响生物特性的。,"And we want to know how biology does and does not influence culture, as well as how culture affects biology."
5085,在欧洲大陆，虽然现在用“社会人类学”做为“民族学”的同义词正在迅速普及，但“人类学”一词仍然常表示“体质人类学”。,"In continental Europe, the word ‘anthropology’ often still tends to carry the meaning ‘physical anthropology’, though there too ‘social anthropology’ is now rapidly gaining ground as a synonym for ‘ethnology’."
5085,"的确，目前欧洲最主要的专业组织叫做“社会人类学家欧洲协会”（European Association of Social Anthropologists或l’Association Europe ́enne des Anthropologues Sociaux）,该组织成立于1989年，这个时期是该 学科在整个欧洲包括西欧和东欧迅速发展的时间。","Indeed, the main professional organization in Europe is called the European Association of Social Anthropologists or l’Association Europe ́enne des Anthropologues Sociaux.It was founded in 1989 amidst a rapid growth of the discipline across Europe, both Western and Eastern."
5085,在美国，“民族学”一词与“文化人类学”并存。,"In the United States, the word ‘ethnology’ co-exists with ‘cultural anthropology’."
5086,体质人类学家研究作为生物有机体的人，追溯人类动物的演化发展，考察过去和现在人类内部的生物学变异。,"Physical anthropologists study humans as biological organisms, tracing the evolutionary development of the human animal and looking at biological variations within the species, past and present."
5086,文化人类学对人类文化惑兴趣，或者对社会的生活方式感兴趣。,"Cultural anthropologists are concerned with human cultures, or the ways of life in societies."
5086,在文化人类学领域有考古学家、语言学家和民族学家。考古学家通常从过去的文化出发研究物质对象，试图以此解释人类行为：语言学家研究语言，文化借助语言得以维持并代代相传；民族学家研究已观察到、体验到的文化，与他们想要了解其文化的那些人进行讨论。,"Within the field of cultural anthropology are archaeologists, who seek to explain human behavior by studying material objects, usually from past cultures; linguists, who study languages, by which cultures are maintained and passed on to succeeding generations; and ethnologists, who study cultures as they have been observed, experienced, and discussed with persons whose culture they seek to understand."
5087,对特定文化环境中音乐的研究，开始于19世纪对民歌的搜集，如今它已经发展成一个专门的领域，叫作民族音乐学（ethnomusicology）。,"The study of music in specific cultural settings, beginning in the 19th century with the collection of folk songs, has developed into a specialized field, called ethnomusicology."
5087,就像力了民俗本身而进行的研究一样，民族音乐学与人类学既有联系，又独立于人类学。,"Like the study of folktales for their own sake, ethnomusicology is both related to and somewhat independent of anthropology."
5087,不过，从该领域所关注的各种问题当中抽出几个一般人类学感兴趣的概念，还是可能的。,"Nevertheless, it is possible to sort out several concepts of interest to general anthropology from the fields various concerns."
5087,首先，我们要问：一种文化怎么看待音乐？,"To begin, we may ask these questions： How does a culture conceive of music?"
5087,把音乐和其他表现形式区分开来的最重要的东西是什么？,What is considered of primary importance when distinguishing music from other modes of expression?
5087,对一个人来说是音乐的东西，对另一个人来说只是噪音而已。,What is music to one person is mere noise to another.
5087,音乐是一种交流的形式，其中包含着非言词成分。音乐传达的信息往往是抽象情结而非具体观念，不同的倾听者会以不同的方式体会它。,"Music is a form of communication that includes a nonverbal component.The information transmitted is often abstract emotion rather than concrete ideas, and it is experienced in a variety of ways by different listeners."
5088,此外，人们选择词语和句子以便传达意义，而在一种文化中有意义的东西，在另一种文化中可能没有意义。,"Moreover, people choose words and sentences to communicate meaning, and what is meaningful in one culture may not be in another."
5088,事实上，我们的语言用法影响我们文化的其他部分，而文化的其他部分也影响我们的语言用法。,"In other words, our use of language affects, and is affected by, the rest of our culture."
5088,关于语言与文化其他方面相互关系的全部问题是民族语言学（ethnolinguistics)研究的领域，这是语言人类学中的一个专业，几乎已成为独立的研究领域。,"The whole question of the relationships between language and other aspects of culture is the province of ethnolinguistics, an outgrowth of both ethnology and descriptive linguistics, which has become almost a separate field of inquir."
5088,民族语言学注重研究与社会、文化和人类行为有关的语言结构和用法的每一方面。,"Ethno-linguistics is concerned with every aspect of the structure and use of language that has anything to do with society, culture, and human behavior."
5089,就人类学的大部分历史来说，人类学家依靠印刷出版的资源以共享信息，特别是依靠白描型的民族志，偶尔辅之以照片，在很少的情况中，辅之以影片和类似的记录。,"For most of the discipline's history, anthropologists have relied upon print resources to share information, especially the very linear genre of ethnography, occasionally supplemented with photographs and, in fewer cases, film and analog recordings."
5089,民族志特别反映出西方人对学术工作的态度是我们学科的基础。,The ethnography in particular reflects our discipline's roots in the Western approach to scholarly work.
5089,然而，人类学家研究并与之共事的许多民族，具有他们所依靠的不同的“读写能力”。,"However, many of the people anthropologists have studied and worked with have different literacies that they draw upon."
5089,的确，文化人类学家研究各式各样的人类行为，包括音乐、口述故事、仪式 舞蹈、编织和粗糙雕刻等。,"Indeed, cultural anthropologists work with numerous guises of human behavior, ranging from music to oral narrative, ritual dance, weaving, and spray-paint grafitti."
5089,人类学在所有研究的最自然的“多媒体”中是可论证的。,"Anthropology is arguably among the most naturally ""multimedia"" of all studies."
5090,民族志记录的是民族，如同彼得·梅森（Mason 1990: 13）命名的那样“是种翻译和演绎的形式”。,"Ethnography is the recording of an ethnos, and, as Peter Mason phrases it (1990:13), ‘a form of translation and reduction’."
5090,他接着说（Mason 1990: 13）：“所有的民族志，都是对遭遇他者的经历的记录，是一项使他者丧失独特性的举动”。,"‘All ethnography’, he goes on to say (ibid.), ‘is an experience of the confrontation with Other set down in writing, an act by which that Other is deprived of its specificity’."
5090,他谈到这种写作受到特定风格和文化传统的限制，必须满足某种期望。,He notes that such writing conforms to particular stylistic and literary conventions.It must meet certain expectations.
5091,尽管在日前的人类学工作中历史角度变得更加重要，特别是 1980年代以来，大多数人类学研究仍然可以被描述为不考虑历史演进的“快照”。,"Although the historical dimension has become more important in recent anthropological work, particularly since the 1980s, a majority of anthropological studies could probably still be described as synchronic ""snapshots""."
5091,我们可以使用术语“民族志的现在时”去描述相关文献的时态特征。,"We may use the term ""the ethnographic present"" to characterise the literary tense involved."
5091,在某种意义上说，探究努尔人、特罗布里恩德岛民或斯瓦特的帕坦人是“在什么时候”像专论中描述的那样，建立某种文化或制定某种形式的社会组织，这是不相关的问题。,"In a certain sense, it can be irrelevant when the Nuer, the Trobriand islanders or the Swat Pathans enact a certain culture or form of social organisation as described in a monograph."
5091,对这些人民的研究的重要性主要地并不在于他们的历史的或地理的解释力量，而是在于他们帮助我们从最广泛的意义上去理解社会生活的差异之处和共同之处，他们帮助我们了解人类生活形式的比较性知识。,"The importance of the studies of these peoples does not lie primarily in their historical or genealogical explanatory power, but rather in their contribution to our understanding of differences and similarities of social life in the widest sense.They contribute to our comparative knowledge of forms of human life."
5092,这在我们的研究所所处的东中欧比在别的什么地方都更明显。,"This is nowhere more evident than in East-Central Europe, where our institute is located."
5092,德国学者在18世纪发展出开拓性的研究议程，创造了众多的关键术语，此后很久一个统一的德国国家才形成。,"German scholars developed pioneering research agendas and coined numerous key terms in the eighteenth century, long before the forging of a unified German state."
5092,在这里，就像在欧洲的其他地方一样，人类学的领域一直都被打上了民族主义的鲜明烙印，即使是在其人类学的遗产后来被苏联马克思主义理论的锲入所改变的那些地方，其连续性也仍然是实质性的这些演讲首要关注的是关于民族学心（而非民俗学即关于自己的人民的研究）的比较研究事业的四个变体，但是我们必须承认，民族框架几乎从一开始就一直影响着人类学的这两个发展路向。,"Here, as elsewhere in Europe, the anthropological field has been strongly marked by nationalism.Even where this legacy was later modified by the imposition of Soviet Marxist theories, the continuities remain substantial.These lectures are primarily devoted to four variants of the comparative enterprise of Völkerkunde rather than to Volkskunde, the study of one’s own people, but we need to recognize that national frames have influenced both of these strands of anthropology almost from the very beginning."
5093,"我们以英语中 "" uncle""  一词的亲属类别为例。","Using English as our example, take the class of kin which English-speakers call uncle."
5093,"这里的名称就是"" uncle"" 一词本身。",The designatum here is the word uncle itself.
5093,所指对象是家族谱系中所提及的如下各点（即父亲的兄弟、母亲的兄弟、父亲姐妹的丈夫、母亲姐妹的丈等）。,"The denotata are genealogical points of reference FB, MB, FZH, MZH, and so on (that is, father’s brother, mother’s brother, father’s sister’s hus- band, and mother’s sister’s husband; denotata are customarily abbreviated in this way)."
5094,所以个体发现他们自己“在讲话时”依据的是无意识预设的语言代码和知识实践。,"Thus do individuals find themselves ""being spoken"" by unconscious, preconditioned linguistic codes and knowledge-practices."
5094,个体远不是在利用话语手段去达到全新的甚至有意图的目的，不过是在进行“没有新意和目的的模仿”（Kearney 1988: 6）事实上，要不是话语所提供的主体地位，人的意识将不复存在。,"Far from speakers' employing discursive measures for the effecting of original or even intentioned ends, here is ""mimesis without origin or end"" (Kearney 1988:6).Indeed, were it not for the subject-positions which discourses offer, human consciousnesses would not exist as human as such."
5094,话语造就了我们成为人的资格。,Discourses create our humanity.
5095,但弗雷泽的确对巫术的两大基本原则做出有价值的区分。,Frazer did make a useful distinction between two fundamental principles of magic.
5095,第一条原则，“同类相生”他称之为“模拟巫术”(imitative magic)(有时也叫交感巫术）。,"The first principle, that wlike produces like, he called imitative magic."
5095,例如，在缅甸，一个被拒绝的情人可能会请一名巫师做一个他所爱之人的人偶。,"In Burma, for example, a rejected lover might engage a sorcerer to make an image of his would-be love."
5095,要是这个人偶被抛入水里，随后施以某些符咒，那么这个不幸的女孩就会发疯。,"If this image were tossed into water, to the accompaniment of certain charms, the hapless girl would go mad."
5095,这样，这个女孩将会遭受与她的人偶相似的命运。,"Thus, the girl would suffer a fate similar to that of her image."
5095,弗雷泽的第二条原则被称为“接触巫术”（contagious magic），它指这样一种观念，即事物或人之间一旦发生接触就能彼此影响，即使此后不再接触。,Frazer's second principle was called contagious magic—the concept that things or persons once in contact can afterward influence one another.
5096,另一种观点认为，本族语言使用者认为最能表达出词的意思的（当然在形式上也是正确的）分析，才是最好的分析。,"There is a place for the alternative view that the best is precisely the one which is most meaningful to the native speaker (while also being formally correct, of course)."
5096,如果他们反对这种分析方法，那么这一方法就是错误的。,"If native speakers disagree about which one this may be, then so be it."
5096,这个问题的争论被称为“上帝真理与魔法的大对局”。“上帝真理”主张人们探究认知现实，而“魔法”对这种探知的可行性持怀疑态度。,"The debate which ensued on this issue is called that of ‘God’s truth versus hocus-pocus’, with the ‘God’s truth’ side favouring the search for cognitive reality and the ‘hocus-pocus’ side maintaining a scepticism of this very possibility."
5097,尽管世界上的大多数民族都被人类学家归类为父系的，许多群体——特别是在美拉尼西亚、非洲和北美——被归类为母方世系。,"Although most peoples in the world are classified by anthropologists as either patrilineal or cognatic, many groups, particularly in Melanesia, Africa and North America, are classified as matrilineal."
5097,一个常见的误解是：母系家族关系系统只是父系系统的一种简单颠倒，用女人代替男人。,"It is a common misunderstanding that matrilineal kinship systems are simply inversions of patrilineal ones, where women have taken the place of men."
5097,有些人甚至认为，母方世系与母权制是一回事，这是错误的。,Some may even believe that matrilineality is the same as matriarchy.This is wrong.
5097,在母系社会，正如在父系社会，男人通常担任了正式的政治职务并控制了重要的经济资源。,"In matrilineal societies, just as in patrilineal ones, men usually hold formal political offices and control important economic resources."
5097,这意味着母系系统比父系系统更加复杂。,This implies that matrilineal systems tend to be more complicated than patrilineal ones.
5097,图7.2说明了简化的父系系统和简化的母系系统。,"In Figure 7.2 above, the difference between a simplified patrilineal and a simplified matrilineal system is illustrated."
5097,从生物学上说，亲属关系在图表的两边是完全相同的；而实际上，我们看到，A群体与B群体各自所属的家族群体的组成方式十分不同。,"Biologically, the kin relations are identical on both sides of the diagram; in practice, however, we see that person A belongs to a kin group composed in a very different way from person B's group."
5098,因此，在1968年学生反抗活动之中以及之后，具有反叛性的人类学学生幵始研究并质问他们的教授们在纳粹时期都干了些什么——这并不是偶然的。西柏林是学生反抗运动的主要中心，而海德堡则是另外几个重要的中心地区之一，人类学的情况也是如此。,"It was thus no coincidence that during the student revolt of 1968 and thereafter rebellious students of anthropology researched and asked questions about what their professors had been doing under Nazism.West Berlin was the main center of the students' revolt, but Heidelberg was one of its other important focal areas, and this was certainly so in anthropology."
5098,在1968年，海德堡的人类学教授是威廉˙埃米尔˙米尔曼，当反抗的学生指控他曾经是纳粹主义的一名积极同谋者的时候，米尔曼选择了辞职并退休。,"In 1968 the anthropology professor at Heidelberg was Wilhelm Emil Mühlmann.When revolting students accused him of having been an active accomplice of Nazism, Mühlmann chose resignation from office and went into retirement."
5099,例如，历史语言学家试图通过研究原来语言的自然变化和来自北方的入侵者接触所产生的影响这两方面，来辨别和说明从中世纪早期的口语拉丁语向中世纪晚期的法语和西班牙语的发展。,"Historical linguists, for example, attempt to identify and explain the development of early medieval spoken Latin into later medieval French and Spanish by investigating both natural change in the original language and the influence of contacts with invaders from the north."
5099,在历史语言学家和描述语言学家之间没有什么冲突，人们现在认为两种研究方式是相互依存的。,No conflicts exist between historical and descriptive linguists; the two approaches are recognized as interdependent.
5099,甚至现代语言也是不断变化的；例如，考虑一下英语中一词的变化了的意思。今天，它用来指男同性恋者和女同性恋者。,"Even a modern language is constantly changing; consider, for example, the changed meaning of the word gay in English, which today is used to refer to homosexual persons."
5099,它在1942年的戏剧《我们的心情洋溢着青春活力和欢乐》中的意思，说明这一词在现在和那时有不同的用法。,Its meaning in the title of the 1942 play Our Hearts Were Young and Gay illustrates the word different usage as recently as that time.
5099,这类变化发生所依据的原则，只能由历史来确立。,Such changes occur according to principles that can be established only historically.
5100,然而，变革论只在 20 世纪 80 年代才以其自己的能力作为一种范式出现，在这之前曾经是进化论和反进化论（在此意义上，它将瞬间变化置于缓慢进化之上）（比如 Cucchiari 1981) 。,"Yet it emerged as a paradigm in its own right – at once evolutionist and anti-evolutionist (in the sense that it puts instantaneous change over slow evolution) – only in the 1980s (e.g., Cucchiari 1981)."
5100,今天它的主要特色是研究象征文化的起源，或文化起源 ( culturo - genesis ) 。,"Its central feature today is the search for the origin of symbolic culture, or culturo-genesis."
5100,通过给予对女性的第一次人类革命的煽动性力量，转向弗洛伊德的男性中心理论。,It turns Freud on his androcentric head by giving the instigating force of that Wrst human revolution to the females of the species.
5101,这种变化的主要原因之一，可能是灵长动物的栖树生存。,One of the main reasons for this change is probably the primates' arboreal existence.
5101,在树上生活的动物要不断活动并对环境做出反应。,An animal living in the trees is constantly acting and reacting to the environment.
5101,来自手和脚、眼和耳，以及平衡、运动、热、触和痛的 感觉器官的信息，同时传递到脑皮层。,"Messages from the hands, feet, eyes, and ears, as well as from the sensors of balance, movement, heat, touch, and pain, are simultaneously relayed to the cortex."
5101,显然，脑皮层必须有相当大的发展，以便搜集、分析并协调这些印象，并把恰当的反应沿运动神经传回原来的感受器。,"Obviously the cortex had to develop considerably to receive, analyze, and coordinate these impressions and transmit the appropriate responses back down the motor nerves to the proper receptors."
5101,"增大的脑皮层不仅使得灵长目动物更为有效地进行日常生存斗争，而且也为强化的大脑活动功能或者思维能力排除障碍,这种思维能力在人类产生中起了决定性的作用。","The enlarged cortex not only made the primates more efficient in the daily struggle for survival but also prepared the way for heightened cerebration, or thought—an ability that played a decisive role in humanity's emergence."
5102,不管乱伦禁忌是由什么引起的，考察它对社会结构的影响，我们可以看到它的效用。,"Whatever its cause, the utility of the incest taboo can be seen by examining its effects on social structure."
5102,与反对乱伦密切相关是反对内婚制（endogamy），即在特定的个人（譬如堂 兄弟姐妹和堂表姐妹夫或堂表嫂或弟媳等）的群体内婚配的规则。,"Closely related to prohibitions against incest are rules against endogamy, or marriage within a particular group of individuals (cousins and inlaws, for example)."
5102,如果该群体只被定义为直系家庭，那么社会一般禁止或至少劝阻内婚制，因而鼓励外婚制(exogamy)，即在该群体之外的婚配。,"If the group is defined as one's immediate family alone, then societies generally prohibit or at least discourage endogamy and practice or at least encourage exogamy, or marriage outside the group.Yet a society that practices exogamy at one level may practice endogamy at another."
5102,,"Among the Trobriand Islanders, for example, each individual has to marry outside of his or her own clan and lineage (exogamy)."
5103,个体构建并运用形式以便赋予它们多样化的个人意义；使它们在他们自己的生活中具有独特意义：他们的意图、兴趣、希望、需求、信仰、价值观念等等。,"Individuals make and use forms so as to fill them with a diversity of personal meanings; they give them sense and significance particular to their own lives: their purposes, interests, desires, needs, beliefs, values, and so on."
5103,这些构成了他们的形式的内容。,It is this which makes up the content of their forms.
5103,而且，正是这种个体运用导致了他们在集体意义上的交换；个体不断地为社会生活带来文化形式，不断地构建社会并分享文化，为的是表达他们的个体意义。,"Moreover, it is this individual usage which causes their collective exchange; individuals continue to bring cultural forms to social life, continue to make society and share culture, for the purpose of expressing their individual meanings."
5104,“内省癖”，是英国维多利亚女王时代的心理学家对探索内在动机的看法。,"""Morbid introspection"" was the British Victorian psychologists' view of exploring inner motives."
5104,,Just stiffen the upper lip and carry on!
5104,与我居住的美国大学城的电话号码簿上列出的名单相比，英国牛津的电话号码簿上只列出了一小部分精神病医生和心理学家的名字，即使牛津要远远大于我所住的大学城。,"The telephone directory of Oxford, England, lists only a fraction of the number of psychiatrists and psychologists listed in the American university town where I live, even though Oxford is much larger."
5104,这一区别无疑反映出美国的心理学化，但是英美文化也有一个共同之处，即都注重控制激情。,"This difference doubtless reflects the psychologizing of America, but Anglo-American culture shares the emphasis on controlling passions."
5105,将阐释的方法应用于非洲南部的岩石艺术，要求具备两种知识：布须曼人的民族志和出神的性质。,Applying the interpretive approach to southern African rock art requires knowledge of two subjects: Bushman ethnography and the nature of trance.
5105,就后者而言，要对它有一个清晰的理解，需要把民族志的资料和从实验室实验得来的资料结合起来。,"With respect to the latter, a clear understanding comes from a combination of ethnographic data and data gained experimentally in laboratories."
5105,因为所有的人都有着相同的神经系统，不管是来自美国的城市居民，还是来自非洲南部的寻食者，抑或是来自亚马逊森林的园艺农业人口，不管是谁，他们进入出神状态的过程都要经历三个相同的阶段。,"Because all human beings have essentially the same nervous system, whether they are urban dwellers from the United States, food foragers from southern Africa, horticulturalists from the Amazon forest, or whoever, they all progress through the same three stages when going into trance."
5105,在第一个阶段，神经系统产生出各种各样闪闪发光的、有规律跳动的、旋转的和不断 变换的几何图案，即所谓的内视现象（eiitoptic phenomena）（那些得过偏头痛的人其症状就类似于此）。,"In the first stage, the nervous system generates a variety of luminous, pulsating, revolving, and constantly shifting geometric patterns known as entoptic phenomena (anyone who has suffered from migraine headaches is familiar with these)."
5106,能动在行动，而能动性即是这种能力、权力，正是其成为行动的来源和始作俑者，能动者是行动的主体。,"Agents act, and agency is the capability, the power, to be the source and originator of acts; agents are the subjects of action."
5106,韦伯（Weber）认为应区分行动与纯粹（动物）行为，行动是建立在一系列具有人类理性特点的行为基础上的。,"Weber suggested thatacts be distinguished from mere (animal) behaviour on the basis of acts being seen to entail a number of features of human rationality: consciousness, reflection, intention, purpose and meaning."
5106,他感到社会科学是一门对人类行动的意义和行动背后的选择进行解释性研究的学科。,He felt that social science should be an interpretive study of the meanings of human action and the choices behind them.
5106,米德（C.H. Mead）力图澄清韦伯关于意义的概念以及对意义的社会科学理解（Verstehung），他将行动划分为：欲望、情境界定和完成。,"G.H.Mead sought to clarify the Weberian notion of meaning, and its social-scientific understanding (Verstehung), by differentiating acts into: impulses, definitions of situations, and consummations."
5107,能动在行动，而能动性即是这种能力、权力，正是其成为行动的来源和始作俑者，能动者是行动的主体。,"Agents act, and agency is the capability, the power, to be the source and originator of acts; agents are the subjects of action."
5107,韦伯（Weber）认为应区分行动与纯粹（动物）行为，行动是建立在一系列具有人类理性特点的行为基础上的。,"Weber suggested thatacts be distinguished from mere (animal) behaviour on the basis of acts being seen to entail a number of features of human rationality: consciousness, reflection, intention, purpose and meaning."
5107,他感到社会科学是一门对人类行动的意义和行动背后的选择进行解释性研究的学科。,He felt that social science should be an interpretive study of the meanings of human action and the choices behind them.
5107,米德（C.H. Mead）力图澄清韦伯关于意义的概念以及对意义的社会科学理解（Verstehung），他将行动划分为：欲望、情境界定和完成。,"G.H.Mead sought to clarify the Weberian notion of meaning, and its social-scientific understanding (Verstehung), by differentiating acts into: impulses, definitions of situations, and consummations."
5108,但是，拟人论的阴魂不散。,But anthropomorphism dies hard.
5108,当人们错将拟人论当成最为稳妥的现实主义时，就象那些认为个人，即男人和女人，才在真正地参加选举，修饰仪容，制造船舶，发明机械、撰写诗篇和奏演乐章的人们所做的那样，拟人论的垂死过程就犹为缓慢与困难。,"The death is especially slow and difficult when anthropomorphism is mistaken for the soundest realism, as it is by those who actually see people, individual men and women, voting, enameling their fingernails, building ships, inventing machines, writing sonnets, composing symphonies, etc."
5108,他们问道，“新的文化要素除了来自个人精神，来自男人、女人和儿童头脑中的创造性活动，还能来自何方呢？”,"""Where else,"" they ask, ""could new cultural elements come from but from the creative act of some individual human mind— from a man, woman, or child?"""
5109,依据年龄有成员资格的有组织的一类人，叫作年龄等级(age grade)。,An organized class of people with membership based on age is known as an age grade.
5109,从理论上来说，年龄等级的成员资格应是自动满足的：一个人达到了合适的年龄，因而就毫无疑问地被纳入特定的年龄等级。例如，在我们马上就要考察的东非蒂里基人中就是这种情况。,"Theoretically speaking, membership in an age grade ought to be automatic: One reaches the appropriate age and thus is included, without question, in the particular age grade.Just such situations exist, for example, among the East African Tiriki, whose system we will examine shortly."
5109,然而，有时候，个体必须要通过购买才能加入他们有资格进入的那个年龄等级。,"Sometimes, though, individuals have to buy their way into the age grade they are eligible for."
5109,在北美平原的某些印第安人中间就是这样，他们要求男孩购买合适的服装，花钱学会某些特定的舞蹈和歌曲才能成为一个年龄等级的成员。,"This was the case among some of the Indians of the North American plains, who required boys to purchase the appropriate costumes, dances, and songs for age-grade membership."
5110,伯恩斯坦强调这些都是理想类型，且个人根据各自的社会背景在这些代码间游移，他还进一步指出，特定社会背景可以被视为是由这些代码中的一种或几种支配的。,"While emphasizing that these were ideal types, and that individuals moved between codes according to social context, nevertheless, Bernstein further argued that particular social contexts could be seen to be dominated by one or other of these codes."
5110,它们的用法代表了一种亚文化和社会关系中特定形式的功能（而不是个体心理学）。,Their usage was a function of subculture and of particular forms of social relationship (rather than individual psychology).
5110,那么严格代码是适用于“地位取向”的社会环境和社会关系，例如军队、监狱、年龄级次、长期建立的友谊与婚姻，而精细代码则适用于“个人取向”的那些社会环境和社会关系。,"Hence, restricted code pertained to ‘position-oriented’ social milieux and relations—armies, prisons, age-grades, longestablished friendships and marriages—while elaborated code pertained to ‘person-oriented’ ones."
5111,在撒哈拉南部的非洲社会，各种形式的年龄分群都得到利用。,
5111,,The most varied use of age grouping is found in African societies south of the Sahara.
5111,例如，在东非的蒂里基人中，七个命名的年龄组要经历四个前后相继的年龄等级。,"Among the Tiriki of East Africa, for example, seven named age sets pass through four successive age grades."
5111,每个年龄组含有15年的时段，因此每105年开放一次以接纳新的加入者。,Each age set embraces a 15-year age span and thus opens to accept new initiates every 105 years.
5112,一贯具有绅士风度的雷德菲尔德善意地接受了这些批评，并且把它们加入到他于1950年代中期发表的综合性著作《小社区》（Redfield 1955)和《农民社会与文化KRedfield 1956)中。,"Redfield, as always the gentleman, accepted the criticisms with good grace and incorporated them into his synthetic books of the mid-1950s, The Little Community (1955) and Peasant Society and Culture (1956)."
5112,正是从这个时候起，“农民”（peasant)被确立为一个分析范畴并成为一个独立的研究主题。,"This was the time when the ""peasant"" was established as an analytic category and a subject matter in its own right."
5112,在关于“农民”定义的无数争论中出现了两种研究方法。,"Out of numerous debates over definitions of peasants, two approaches emerged."
5112,雷德菲尔德的方法聚焦于“生活方式”、价值与世界观、社区凝聚力和传统。而沃尔夫的方法首先从物质基础和结构关系出发——农民是能够有效控制土地的农业生产者，他们的目标是生存而非再投资。,"Redfield’s focused on ""way of life,"" values and worldview, community cohesion, and tradition.Wolf's began with the material base and with structural relationships—peasants were agricultural producers in effective control of land who aimed at subsistence, not reinvestment."
5112,之后，沃尔夫关于农民的研究越来越强调权力关系，它们与经济过程并不矛盾而仅仅只是其对应物。,"After this beginning,Wolf's work on peasantries increasingly emphasized relations of power, not in contradiction to economic processes but as their counterpart."
5113,一个氏族或部族，只要它的成员不是很多，只要社会关系尚能是个人间的关系，它作为社会组织与社会交往的机制便能够通行有效。,"A clan or tribe could be effective as a mechanism of social organization and intercourse as long as its members were not exceedingly numerous, as long as social relations could be personal."
5113,但是，当氏族和部族单元的规模在农业技术发展与食物供给增长的推动下日渐宏大时，它们往往会自行解体。,"But when, under the impetus of a developing agricultural technology and an increasing food supply, clan and tribal units grew to huge size, they tended to fall apart of their own weight."
5113,可见，原始社会往往是因人口数最绝对增长而解组的。,Primitive society tended therefore to disintegrate as a consequence of sheer increase of numbers.
5113,要防止混乩，就需有一种新型社会组织。,A new type of social organization was therefore required if chaos was to be averted.
5113,我们在国家中找到了这一新型组织。,This new organization was found in the State.
5113,这是农业革命的另一个后果。,This was another consequence of the Agricultural Revolution.
5114,20世纪60年代，由于女权运动的觉醒和各学科对自己宣布为知识的内容的其他形式的自我审查，这个主题的合法性在人类学界也受到了详细的审查，并由于认识论的根本转移而愈演愈烈。,The legitimacy of the topic came under scrutiny in the 1960s in a process that has since accelerated due to very basic epistemic shifts within anthropology in the wake of feminism and other modes of disciplinary self-inspection about its claims to knowledge.
5114,这次转移留下的一个普遍的结论是很多原本被接受的亲属关系理论不再被看作是无可非议的了。,One prevalent conclusion forthcoming from such shifts is that much of received kinship theory is no longer seen as justifiable.
5114,理由有很多。,The reasons are many.
5115,女权主义者不仅关注特定社会的性别关系，也关注人类社会中普遍存在的把性别作为构筑原则的思想（Moore 1988: vii)。,The feminist critique concerns both gender relations in particular societies and the idea of gender as a structuring principle in humansociety generally (H. L. Moore 1988: vii).
5115,前者在本质上可以被视作是一个实际问题，后者是理论问题。所以同样都需得到重视，如同马克思主义、后结构主义和后现代主义一样——人类学中的诸多方面都与女权主义有联系。,"While the former may be regarded as essentially a substantive issue, the latter is a theoretical one and therefore merits the same treatment as, for example, Marxism, poststructuralism, or postmodernism – all perspectives with links to feminism in anthropology."
5116,可能是因为他的排他主义，博厄斯从未将他的思想进行过系统化的理论论述。,"Perhaps because of his particularism, Boas never systematised his ideas in a theoretical treatise."
5116,他的几个学生和伙伴却发展出了若干文化的一般理论，特别是露丝·本尼迪克特（Ruth Benedict）、克罗伯和罗伯特·洛伊（Robert Lowie）。,"Several of his students and associates nevertheless did develop general theories of culture, notably Ruth Benedict, Alfred Kroeber and Robert Lowie."
5116,他最著名的学生是玛格丽特·米德（Margaret Mead， 1901—1978），尽管米德的关于几个不同的太平洋岛屿社会的畅销书被批评为是浅薄的人种学（参见第四章），但不能否认，这些书技巧地使用了来自非西方社会的资料，提出了关于性别关系、社会化和西方政治等方面的问题。,"His most famous student was Margaret Mead (1901–78).Although her bestselling books from various Pacific societies have been criticised for being ethnographically superficial (see Chapter 4), they skilfully used material from non-Western societies to raise questions about gender relations, socialisation and politics in the West."
5116,米德的著作可能比其他任何人类学家的著作都更好地显示了：文化批判的潜力是这个学科与生俱来的。,"Mead’s work shows, probably better than that of any other anthropologist, the potential of cultural criticism inherent in the discipline."
5117,与血缘家庭相反，夫妻家庭以丈夫与妻子的婚姻纽带为基础。,"Conjugal, as opposed to consanguine, families are formed on the basis of marital ties between husband and wife."
5117,夫妻家庭最低限度由已婚的夫妻及其扶养的孩子组成，又被称为核心家庭（nuclear family)；夫妻家庭的其他形式是一夫多妻制家庭和一妻多夫制家庭，这可被设想为有一个共同配偶的核心家庭的集合。,"Minimally, a conjugal family consists of a married couple with their dependent children, otherwise known as the nuclear family; other forms of conjugal families are polygynous and polyandrous families, which may be thought of as aggregates of nuclear families with one spouse in common."
5117,"一夫多妻制家庭包括一个丈夫的多个妻子,而一妻多夫制 家庭则包括一个妻子的多个丈夫。","A polygynous family includes the multiple wives of a single husband, while a polyandrous family includes the multiple husbands of a single wife."
5117,两种家庭经常列在多配偶制家庭的标题之下。,Both are often lumped together under the heading of polygamous families.
5118,在这些社会里，有可能通过新颖地并置指涉熟悉物体的概念而获得创意。,"Originality, in this kind of society, is possible through novel juxtapositions of concepts referring to familiar objects."
5118,列维-斯特劳斯将这种思维操作方式称为拼合（bricolage）(一个“用手头现成工具摆弄修理的人”也可以翻译成杂物工、万事通)。,"LéviStrauss describes this thought operation as bricolage (a ""bricoleur"" can be translated as a handyman, a jack-of-all-trades)."
5118,这种创造性的、联想式的而且“好玩的”思维模式可以与“工程师”的思维模式形成对照，后者是西方社会中主导的抽象科学，受到文字和数字的束缚和训练。,"This creative, associational and ""playful"" mode of thought is contrasted with that of the ""engineer""; the abstract science dominant in Western societies, imprisoned and disciplined by writing and numbers."
5119,这种系统中，三个或更多的群体通过某种轮转交换妻子的方式相互联系起来，因而也许比半偶族系统的规模更大，因为它需要依靠更多的关系去运转。,"A system where three or more groups are mutually linked through some kind of cyclical exchange of wives may be on a larger scale than moiety systems, since it depends on a greater number of relationships to function."
5119,这样一个系统，你要对供应妻子的人（wife-givers）和取走妻子的人（wife-takers）做出种类区分，因而被叫做不对称的联盟系统，而半偶族由对称的联盟系统构成。,"Such a system, where one distinguishes categorically between wife-givers and wife-takers, is called an asymmetrical alliance system, whereas moieties constitute a symmetrical alliance system."
5119,后者暗示着群体之间的平等，而非对称的联盟往往但并不一定就意味着群体之间存在着等级差别。,"While the latter implies equality between the groups, an asymmetrical alliance often, but not necessarily, implies rank differences between the groups."
5119,上缅甸的克钦人在父方家系的层面上实行的是族外婚（Leach 1954），他们交换妻子的规则揭示了一种比雅诺马马人更为复杂和更有等级分化的社会组织形式。,The Kachin of upper Burma practise exogamy at the level of the patrilineage (Leach 1954).Their rules for wife exchange reveal a more complex and more hierarchical social organisation than that of the Yanomamö.
5120,社会阶级结构的基础是角色分化。,The basis of social class structure is role differentiation.
5120,当然，某些角色分化存在于任何一个社会，至少有依据性别和年龄的分化。,"Some role differentiation, of course, exists in any society, at least along the lines of sex and age."
5120,此外，任何必要的角色总会在某种程度上受到重视。,"Furthermore, any necessary role always will be valued to some degree."
5120,在寻食社会中，“好猎人”的角色将会受到重视。,"In a food-foraging society, the role of ""good hunter"" will be valued."
5120,但是，在一个平等社会中，已经有一个人承担了那个角色这一事实，并不阻碍另一个人承担它因此，角色分化本身并不足以造成分层。,"The fact one man already may play that role does not, however, prevent another man from playing it, too, in an egalitarian society.Therefore, role differentiation by itself is not sufficient for stratification."
5120,还有两个必要条件：对角色的正式评价—— 这种评价包含像喜欢一厌恶、崇敬一反感这样的态度，以及对有较高评价角色的获得机会的限制。,"Two more ingredients are necessary: formalized evaluation of roles, involving attitudes such as like/dislike, or admiration/revulsion, and restricted access to the more highly valued roles."
5121,寻食社会的一个重要特点是它的平等主义。,An important characteristic of the food-foraging society is its egalitarianism.
5121,寻食者通常是髙度流动的而且又缺乏动物或机械运输工具，特别是去远处获取食物时，他们必须能不担许多东西行进。,"Food foragers are usually highly mobile, and, lacking animal or mechanical transportation, they must be able to travel without many encumbrances, especially on foodgetting expeditions."
5121,例如，在朱瓦西人中，每个个人的所有物的平均重量在25磅以下。,"The average weight of an individual's personal belongings among the Juhoansi, for example, is just under 25 pounds."
5121,寻食者的物质产品必须限制在最低限度的必需品上，它们包括用于狩猎、采集、捕鱼、建屋的工具，以及制造工具、烹饪器具、捅捉机和网。,"The material goods of food foragers must be limited to the barest essentials, which include implements for hunting, gathering, fishing, building, and making tools, cooking utensils, traps, and nets."
5121,他们很少有机会积累奢侈品或剩余物品，而且没有谁能拥有比别人多得多的物品，这一事实有助于限制地位差异。,"They have little chance to accumulate luxuries or surplus goods, and the fact no one owns significantly more than others helps to limit status differences."
5121,年龄和性别通常是重要的地位差别的唯一根源。,Age and sex are usually the only sources of significant status differences.
5122,平衡互惠（balanced reciprocity)的不同之处在于，它不是长期过程的一部分。,Balanced reciprocity differs in that it is not part of a long-term process.
5122,赠送和接受，以及所涉及的时间都是确定的，为了社会关系能延续下去，一个人有直接的义务以相同的价值及时回报。,"The giving and receiving, as well as the time involved, are more specific; a person has a direct obligation to reciprocate promptly in equal value for the social relationship to continue."
5122,在北美社会，平衡互惠的例子包括这样 一呰做法，比方说，当朋友或同事聚会时轮流交换棒球卡或购买饮料。,Examples of balanced reciprocity in North American society include practices such as trading baseball cards or buying drinks when one's turn comes at a gathering of friends or associates.
5122,非西方社会的例子，包括人类学家罗伯特·罗伊在他关于阿布萨罗卡(克劳）印第安人的经典描述中讲述的那些例子。一个擅长鞣制野牛皮的妇女会为需要一个新圆锥形帐篷顶的邻居提供服务。,Examples from a non-Western society include those anthropologist Robert Lowie related in his classic account of the Crowhides might offer her services to a neighbor who needed a new cover for her tepee.
5123,不过，在过去二十年内，性别人类学已经发生了一些引人注目的转变。,"However, the anthropology of gender has taken some striking turns through the past two decades."
5123,所谓的“女性人类学”兴起于20世纪 70年代，目的不仅在于了解妇女，更是要理解性别关系。,"What has been called an ""anthropology of women"" arose in the 1970s, designed to understand not just women but gender relations."
5123,这一学派的学者想要回答的早期问题，必须设法解决性别不平等和普遍的性别偏见问题。,The early questions scholars in this school sought to answer had to do with gender inequality and universal gender bias.
5123,这些学者也寻求改正先前人类学研究中的男权主义者偏见。,These scholars also sought to correct what was deemed a masculinist bias in previous anthropological research.
5124,它是指用以阻止一个国家强行干涉他国的宪法和内政的国际法。,International laws which prevent one state from forcibly interfering in the constitution and government of another.
5124,它是指“普遍好客”的原则，使陌生人在他人的领土上有权被款待，使国家不能将新获取的领土视为“没有主人的”，不能将当地的居民视为“不存在”。,"Laws of ""universal hospitality"" which grant strangers the right to be treated with civility when they arrive on someone else's territory, and which prevent states from treating newly-acquired territories as ""ownerless"" and their native inhabitants ""as nothing""."
5124,它是指防止“战争罪行”、“反和平的罪行”和“反人性的罪行”的法律。,"Laws which prohibit what are now called ""war crimes"", ""crimes against peace"" and ""crimes against humanity""."
5125,这被认为是从“雅各宾激进派”国家（“Jacobin” state)继承的 “法国式综合征”。,"This is supposed to be the ""French syndrome"" inherited from the ""Jacobin"" state."
5125,这种理论所受到的主要批评是，它允许主导文化将它的标准以法律上虚构的抽象公民的名义强加于人。,The main criticism of this approach is that it allows the dominant culture to impose its standards in the name of an abstract citizen who is a legal fiction.
5125,主导群体将自己包入普遍主义的外衣，忽略这样一个事实，即任何“抽象公民”也属于某一特定文化。,"The dominant group wraps itself into the cloak of universalism and ignores the fact that any ""abstract citizen"" also belongs to a specific culture."
5126,要超越“父亲之法和父亲之名”（The Name and the Law of the Father），必须从女人内部的完全的女性开始重新书写女人；既不模范男人，也不寻求成为他的社会契约的一部分（目标不是达到和男人类似的身份、地位或公共性），而是书写出超越先前所有规范语言的女性经验。,"However, to go beyond ‘the Name and the Law of the Father’, it is necessary to rewrite the woman beginning from that feminine fullness within the woman; not to mimic the male or seek to play a part in his social contracts (not to aim for a male-imitation identity, status or publicity) but to draw on feminine experiences which lie beyond and before conventional languages."
5126,这种“女性用语”强调并给出的是多元性、流动性、节奏感、差异性和恰当性，以此代替男性真理中的单一性、线性和僵化的（二元）对立。,"Such a ‘feminine idiolect’ might emphasize, and give form to, multiplicity, fluidity, rhythm, difference and becoming, in place of the masculine verities of singularity, linearity and fixed (binary) oppositions."
5126,这是一次以诗歌风格出现的试验，形成了新的话语形式（Irigaray 1991）。,It is a matter of experimenting with poetic styles and achieving new discursive forms (cf. Irigaray 1991).
5127,强化仪式是标志群体生命而非个体生命危机时刻的仪式，不论这种危机准确性质如何——严重少雨威胁农作物的生长、突然出现战争对手、疫病横行或者其他危及到每个成员的事件——人们都会举行大型仪式以求减轻群体面临的危险。这将使人们团结起来共同努力，这样，恐惧和困惑就会向集体行动和一定程度的乐观主义让步。,"Rites of intensification are rituals that mark occasions of crisis in the life of the group, rather than an individual.Whatever the precise nature of the crisis—a severe lack of rain that threatens crops in the fields, the sudden appearance of an enemy war party, the onset of an epidemic, or some other event that disturbs everyone—mass ceremonies are performed to allay the danger to the group."
5127,受到危机影响的所有人之间被扰乱的关系恢复到正常的平衡状态，同时共同体的价值也得到颂扬和肯定。,
5128,性暴力及其作为战争武器而被使用的问题，必然成为前南斯拉夫冲突的后果而再度出现。,The issue of sexual violence and its use as a weapon of war has necessarily been taken up in the aftermath of the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia.
5128,强奸一直在战争中使用，只是现在公众注意到了性暴力和性滥用问题，才被公开认识和讨论。,"While rape has long been utilised in war, it is only now with the public attention given to questions of sexual violence and sexual abuse that it is being openly recognised and discussed."
5128,阿蒂那·葛罗斯曼（Arina Grossman)在她关于二战时期最后几个星期东部前线德国妇女被红军强奸的分析中，以令人信服的方式提出必须将我们对强奸问题的理解作为历史去对待，还要提出这种理解在不同的历史背景下有不同的含义。,"Atina Grossmann, in her analysis of the rape of German women by the Red Army on the eastern front during the closing weeks of World War Two, argues persuasively that we must historicise our understandings of rape, and that it has different meanings in different contexts."
5129,因此，这一原则在直系上一个个体与其所有八个曾袓父母外曾袓父母联成亲属，从旁系使一个个人与第三和第四代的堂表兄弟姐妹联成亲属。,"Thus, this principle relates an individual lineally to all eight great-grandparents and laterally to all third and fourth cousins."
5129,由于这样一个巨型的群体实在太大了，在社会生活中不切实际，所以它通常缩减为一个由父亲和母亲的亲属组成的小圈子，称为亲类（kindred）。,"Since such a huge group is too big to be socially practical, it is usually reduced to a small circle of paternal and maternal relatives, called the kindred."
5129,亲类可以定义为通过父母双方与一个活着的个人保持着紧密联系的一群人。,The kindred may be defined as a group of people closely related to one living individual through both parents.
5129,因为亲类是根据旁系而不是根据直系组织起来的——即据以计算每一级亲属关系程度的“自我”或核心个人是这个群体的中心（参见图l0.4)——所以它不是一个真正的继嗣群体。,"Since the kindred is laterally rather than lineally organized—that is, ego, or the focal person the degree of each relationship is reckoned from, is the center of the group (Figure 10.4)—it really is not a descent group, even though it occurs in societies with bilateral descent."
5130,亲属关系的研究，包括相关的婚姻和家庭制度直到最近一直都是人类学调查和争论的中心。,"Studies in kinship, and the related institutions of marriage and the family, have until recently been central to anthropological investigation and debate."
5130,就像拉迪斯拉夫·霍利（Ladislav Holy）所说（1996：1）：“如果说存在一个领域人类学家可以正当地宣布为自己所独有的，那就是亲属关系。”因此，处理跨文化的亲属关系主题是理解人类学大部分核心分析概念、理论和方法的历史发展的关键所在。,"As Ladislav Holy remarks (1996:1), ‘if there was a subject which anthropologists could have rightly claimed to be their own, it was kinship’, and thus the problem of handling the topic of kinship crossculturally is the key to understanding the historical development of a large majority of anthropology’s central analytic concepts, theories and methods."
5131,他们能够命名大量不同种类的亲戚，他们有精确的规则决定谁能与谁结婚，并且，群体被细化为半偶族（moieties）、氏族（clans）和亚氏族（sub-dans）。,"They can name a large number of different kinds of relatives, they have accurate rules determining who can marry whom, and the groups are subdivided into moieties, clans and sub-clans."
5131,亲属制度的研究一直以来都是人类学的一个核心话题。,The study of kinship has always been a core topic in anthropology.
5131,接近1940年代末，特别是在英国的社会人类学，亲属制度如此重要以致绝望的门外汉（和学生）嘲讽地把这门学科叫做“亲属制度学（kinshipology）”。,"Towards the end of the 1940s kinship was so central, especially in British social anthropology, that despairing lay people (and students) spoke ironically of the subject as ""kinshipology""."
5131,许多非人类学家不理解为什么人类学对亲属制度仍然抱有极大兴趣。,Many non-anthropologists have reacted with incomprehension at the great interest in kinship still prevalent in the profession.
5131,是什么方面使得亲属制度如此重要？,What is it about kinship that makes it so important?
5131,简单的回答是，正是在许多社会中，亲属制度是单个的最重要的社会制度。,The simple answer is that in very many societies kinship is the single most important social institution.
5132,"第二类非集权或多中心权力系统是部落(tribe),不幸的是，不同的人以不同的方式使用这个词。","The second type of uncentralized or multicentric authority system is the tribe, a word that, unfor-tunately, is used in different ways by different people."
5132,在一般公众那里，它常用来称呼那些没有组织成国家的民族，而不管他们是构成人类学家所谞的队群、部落还是酋邦。,"Among the general public, it is used commonly to label any people who are not organized into states, irrespective of whether or not they constitute what anthropologists would call bands, tribes, or chiefdoms."
5132,"有时候，这一术语甚至用于某些事实上髙度集权国家的非西方民族(如阿兹特克人）,这样做就如把中国人称作部落一样没有根据。","Sometimes, the term even is applied to non-Western peoples who in fact had strongly centralized states (the Aztecs, for example), a practice no more warranted than calling the Chinese people a tribe."
5132,在历史上，欧洲人发明了该术语，以把他们认为的低等民族与所谓高等的、“文明的”欧洲人作对比。,"Historically, Europeans coined the term to contrast people they regarded as inferior with supposedly superior, ""civilized"" Europeans."
5133,冷战深刻地影响了这一时期的社会科学，独立后新国家的出现则是另外一个影响要素。,"The Cold War profoundly affected the social sciences in this period, as did the emergence of new nations after independence."
5133,区域研究计划扩展到大学、研究机构和智囊团以及基金会的动议中。,"Area studies programs expanded within universities, at research institutes and think tanks, and in foundation initiatives."
5133,尽管被政治学所主导，但是这些计划仍然为人类学家在地方层面进行田野调查拓展出了空间，它们也极大扩展了学科所到达的古老文明区域的地理边界。,"Although dominated by political science, these programs created space for anthropologists to carry out local-level fieldwork, greatly enlarging the discipline's geographical reach into the areas of old civilizations."
5133,相同的战略利益带来了研究基金，它们挑选优先考虑的区域，随之而来的结果是研究倾斜于那些受到偏爱的区域。,"The same strategic interests that yielded research funding selected the areas to be given priority, with a resultant skewing toward favored areas."
5134,然而他们的文化背景是完全不同的，他们过去是五大湖地区林地的谷物耕作者和野生稻采集者，具有完全不同于科曼奇人在其袓居地的原米那些社会、政治和宗教的制度。,"Yet their cultural background was quite different; formerly, they were settled farmers with social, political, and religious institutions quite unlike those of the Comanche in their ancestral homeland."
5134,那些其袓先文化完全不同的民族对相似环境状况的相似文化调适的这种发展被称为趋同演化（convergent evolution)。,This kind of development of similar cultural adaptations similar environmental conditions by peoples whose ancestral cultures were quite different is called convergent evolution.
5134,特别令人感兴趣的是，切延内人的转变是从谷物种植向寻食生活方式的转变。,Especially interesting is that the Cheyenne switch was from a farming to a food-foraging way of life.
5134,与西方人的“进步”观念不同，生存实践的变化并非从依靠野生食物进步到农业，它也可能走另一条道路。,"Contrary to Western notions of ""progress"", change in subsistence practices does not inevitably go from dependence on wild food to farming; it may go the other way as well."
5135,矿主设想在他们不需要劳动力的时期，可以将矿工们送回他们的村子，但这是不可能发生的。,"The mine-owners assumed that they could send the workers back to their villages in periods when their labour was not needed; this did not come about, however."
5135,原计划周期性移居的劳动力实际导致农村部分地区人口减少，并且最终整个家庭会或多或少永久性地居住在采矿小镇上。,"The labour migration, intended to be seasonal, led to a partial depopulation of the rural areas, and eventually entire families lived more or less permanently in the mining towns."
5135,以前是农民而现在成为永久无产阶级的人口就出现了。在铜带省所做的最早的都市化的人类学研究中，戈弗雷·威尔逊（Godfrey Wilson，1941 — 1942）提出了一个“去部落化”（de-tribalisation）的术语，换句话说，他强调的是都市化所带来的社会一体化中的质的变化。,"A permanent proletarianisation of a former farmer population had taken place.In the first anthropological study of urbanisation in the Copperbelt, Godfrey Wilson (1941–2) introduces the term ""de-tribalisation""; in other words, he emphasises the qualitative change in social integration entailed by urbanisation."
5136,阿帕杜莱的文章中的一个主要观点，也是其他关于全球化的学者持有的观点，是去领土化——它并不只是意味着大规模，而且同样意味着空间维度的重要性被削减——使对社会和文化世界进行新的概念化成为必要。,"A major point in Appadurai's article, and one that other writers on globalisation have also made, is that de-territorialisation – which does not merely amount to large scale, but to the reduced importance of the spatial dimension as such – necessitates new conceptualisations of the social and cultural world."
5136,20世纪晚期，科技、人员和金钱能够而且事实上也比以往更加频繁、快速而轻易地跨越全球四处移动。,"Ideas, technologies, people and money can be, and are, moved about more frequently, quickly and easily across the globe in the late twentieth century than ever before."
5136,它的一个后果，便是流动或颠沛流离人口的增长，常用移位来描述（displacement）。,"One result, often described in terms of displacement, is the growth of populations on the move or living in exile."
5137,它们还假定，学术体裁和文学体裁相互渗透，描述文化的写作真正是试验性和伦理性的。,They assume that academic and literary genres interpenetrate and that the writing of cultural descriptions is properly experimental and ethical.
5137,它们把焦点放在文本生产和修辞上以便突出文化叙述的建构和人为的性质。,"Their focus on text making and rhetoric serves to highlight the constructed, artificial nature of cultural accounts."
5137,这种做法削弱了过度透明的权威模式，把注意力引向民族志的历史困境，亦即，民族志总是陷入发明文化而非再现文化的境地（Wagner 1975)，这些文章所提问题的范围不属于任何传统意义上的文学，这一点将很快变得明显。,"It undermines overly transparent modes of authority, and it draws attention to the historical predicament of ethnography, the fact that it is always caught up in the invention, not the representation, of cultures (Wagner 1975 ).As will soon be apparent, the range of issues raised is not literary in any traditional sense."
5137,大部分的文章虽然焦点在文本实践，然而都抵达了文本之外的语境：权力、抵抗、制度限制以及创新的语境。,"Most of the essays, while focusing on textual practices, reach beyond texts to contexts of power, resistance, institutional constraint, and innovation."
5138,东西方的关系，无论是虚构还是真实存在，现在都与全球化的进程密切相关，也是人类学越来越重要的研究对象。,"The relations between Occident and Orient, whether imagined or real, are now bound up with the process of globalization, also an increasing object of anthropological enquiry."
5138,1993年诺曼•龙在英联邦社会人类学学会十年大会后所出版的六卷文集中的一卷中谈到“全球化”、“本土化”，甚至“再本土化”（Long 1996)。,"In one of six volumes stemming from the 1993 Decennial Conference of the Association of Social Anthropologists of the Commonwealth, Norman Long (1996) speaks of ‘globalization’, ‘localization’, and even ‘re-localization’.Globalization involvesprocesses of movement in population (e.g."
5138,全球化涉及到人口移动（例如劳动力迁移）、技术、资本、科技和科技知识，以及符号意义（例如“现代化”和“全球化”本身，以及比 如在欧盟各国的“公民身份”新概念）的转移过程。,", migrant labour), skills, capital, technology and technical knowledge, and also symbolic representations (e.g., notions of ‘modernization’ and ‘globalization’ itself, and new concepts of ‘citizenship’ such as that of the European Union)."
5139,同族可能有互相帮助的义务，而官僚主义者必须使自己面对不同的人时都遵从同一程序和原则。,"Kinsmen may be obliged to help each other out, whereas bureaucrats have committed themselves to following identical procedures and principles no matter who they are dealing with."
5139,根据亲属制度的意识形态，按照不同的方式对待不同的人是适当的；而按照官僚主义者的思维方式，所有人都要在同样的正式规章和制度面前被一视同仁；当一个高职位的人雇用了他的一个同族，其他人可能会把这叫做裙带关系（nepotism，从字源来讲，来自对侄子的特殊照顾），这是“不公平的”基于亲属制度的差异对待。,"According to a kinship ideology, it is appropriate to treat different people differently; according to a bureaucratic way of thinking, everybody is to be treated according to identical formal rules and regulations.When a person of high rank employs one of his kinsmen, others may call this practice nepotism (literally, particularism favouring nephews), that is, ""unfair"" differential treatment on the basis of kinship."
5139,而按照亲属制度的逻辑，这种差异对待却没有不公正，而更多地意味着忠诚和团结。,"According to a kinship logic, however, such a differential treatment is not unjust but is rather an indication of loyalty and solidarity."
5139,两种逻辑，真实地共存于如今的每个社会，却在理论上难以调和——它们代表了背道而驰的两种道德。,"The two logics, which coexist in virtually every society today, are thus difficult to reconcile in theory – they represent opposing moralities."
5140,与一夫一妻制不同，它也限制人口增长，因此避免了增加资源的压力。,"Unlike monogamy, it also restrains population growth, thereby avoiding increased pressures on resources."
5140,另外，它也为家户提供充袼的男性劳动力。,"Finally, it provides the household with an adequate pool of male labor."
5140,由于其农业、畜牧与贸易三结合的经济，三兄弟一妻多夫婚姻受到西藏人的高度评价，因为它允许共妻丈夫三兄弟能同时从事上述三种工作。,"For tripartite economies of farming, herding, and trading, trifraternal polyandry is highly valued, as it allows the three brothers who are cohusbands to pursue all three options at once."
5140,群婚（group marriage）即几个男人与几个女人相互有性接触权的婚姻形式，这种婚姻也很少见。,"Group marriage, in which several men and women have sexual access to one another, also occurs rarely."
5140,就是在寻找现代婚姻替代形式的年轻人新近的群婚群体内，群婚看来也是短暂的现象，尽管有时它受到公众的注意。,"Even in recent communal groups, among young people seeking alternatives to modern marriage forms, group marriage seems a transitory phenomenon, despite the publicity it sometimes has received."
5141,群体成员、政治、再生产和社会稳定已经作为亲属制度的重要方面被提及。,"Group membership, politics, reproduction and social stability have been mentioned as important aspects of kinship."
5141,亲属制度的一个更具有深远的重要性的维度是其司法制度：人类学有关亲属制度的大部分词汇来自罗马法（Roman Law）并非巧合。,A further important dimension of the kinship institution is the judicial one: it is no coincidence that a large part of the anthropological kinship vocabulary derives from Roman law.
5141,血浓于水，在世界的很多地方都这么说（虽然不是所有的地方），圣经上那个著名的浪子回头之后，迎接他的是父亲为他举办的盛宴。,"Blood is thicker than water, it has been said in many parts of the world (though not everywhere), and the famous return of the biblical lost son was celebrated with a great feast."
5141,杀害兄弟和杀死父亲在世上的许多社会都被认为是所能想到的最严重的罪行，而父母也总是会对孩子们的婚姻大事进行干预——不论婚前婚后。,"Fratricide and patricide are considered the most serious crimes imaginable in many of the world's societies, and parents have always meddled in the marriages of their children – both before and after their consummation."
5141,这些几乎永久存在的问题与这样一个事实有关：家族关系与遗产和继承密切相关。,These nearly perennial problems are tied to the fact that kinship is connected with inheritance and succession.
5142,不幸的是，就如流行的看法一样，常识也并非总是真理。,"Unfortunately, common sense, like conventional wisdom in general, is not always the truth."
5142,值得一问的是：我们 能描述一个群体的人格而又不陷于刻板的印象吗？,A question worth asking is: Can we describe a group personality without falling into stereotyping?
5142,回答似乎是肯定的；我们用抽象的方式可以谈论一个社会的普遍的“文化人格”，只要我们并不期望找到该社会内部的人格一致性。,"The answer appears to be a qualified yes; in an abstract way, we may speak of a generalized ""cultural personality"" for a society, as long as we do not expect to find a uniformity of personalities within that society."
5142,换言之，每个个体由于共同的经验养成与其他人的人格类似的某种人格特点。,"Put another way, each individual develops certain personality characteristics that, from common experience, resemble those of other people."
5142,然而，由于每个个人也受独一无二的经验影响，可能以新的方式对共同的经验做出反应，而且向这些经验注入独一无二（除了同非双胞胎之外）的遗传潜能，所以每个个体也获得独特的人格特质。,"Yet, because each individual is exposed to unique experiences as well, may react to common experiences in novel ways, and brings to these experiences a unique (except for the case of identical twins) genetic potential, each also acquires distinct personality traits."
5143,虽然涂尔干的温和“左派”的、拥护共和的社会学取得了学术界的主导地位，但它也并不是没有竞争者，而他也在自己的著作中与这些竞争者展开了争论。,"Although Durkheim's moderately leftist and prorepublican sociology acquired intellectual dominance, it was not without its competitors, and heargued against those competitors in his writings."
5143,柏格森的反理性主义是被政治“右派”采用的一种学术思潮。,Bergson's antirationalism was one current adopted by the political right.
5143,在这种背景中值得注意的另一位人物是古斯塔夫˙勒庞（1931年去世），他的主要论题是群体行为和群体心理学（Le Bon 1995)。,"Another figure of note in this context is Gustave Le Bon (d. 1933), whose main theme was crowd behavior and crowd psychology (see Le Bon 1995)."
5144,新要素不时地被结合到这个文化流程中来：金属、车轮、由望远镜的使用而引起的信念演变，等等，都在文化发展的一定阶段上加入文化传统。,"New elements are incorporated into the cultural stream from time to time: metals, the wheel, beliefs consequent upon the use of the microscope, etc., enter the cultural tradition at certain stages of its development."
5144,文化要素的新的结合或综合，即发明与发现，在这一相互作用的过程中继续形成着，蒸汽机的发明、元素周期表的发现及热力学诸定律的制订等，都是文化要素的新型综含体。,"New combinations and syntheses of cultural elements—i.e., inventions and discoveries—are continually being formed in this interactive process: the invention of the steam engine, the ""discovery"" of the Periodic System of the elements, the formulation of the laws of thermodynamics, etc., are new combinations or syntheses of cultural elements."
5144,因此，文化传统是由它所消耗的自然力所推动的一个动态系统。,A cultural tradition is therefore a dynamic system (powered by natural forces which it harnesses) that behaves and grows in terms of its own principles and laws.
5145,但是，西方国家生活在城市中的嬉皮士们也和历史上的许多热情派有一点共同之处，那就是他们都热衷于扩大自己的团体，并且希望永远维持自身中介和局外的状态。,But the Western urbanized hippies shared with many historical enthusiastic sects a desire to generalize and perpetuate their liminal and outsider condition.
5145,我带的一名研究生在康奈尔大学举行的一次研讨会上曾给过我一些居住在黑什伯里（Haight-Ashbury )地区的嬉皮士们写的文学作品，这些作品均出自“黑什伯里”文化的黄金时代。在此，我想介绍其中的几段，它们取自一本“大约两个月”发行一期的叫做《圣言》（Orade)的杂志，当时它的主要发行地区是旧金山，在那里，人们称它为嬉皮士的“家乡期刊”。,"One of my graduate students in a seminar at Cornell gave me some Haight-Ashbury literature, produced during the brief heydey of the ""Hashbury"" culture, and I would like to quote some passages from a journal called the Oracle which used to be published ""approximately bi-monthly"" in San Francisco, where it was described as the hippies' ""house journal."""
5146,莫斯也从来没有做过民族志田野调査，但是他广博的语言学知识和文化历史知识使他对献祭、赠礼、人格和民族等现象做出了一些迄今为止最尖锐的分析。,"Mauss also never carried out ethnographic fieldwork, but his vast knowledge of languages and cultural history enabled him to present some of the most penetrating analyses to date of phenomena such as sacrifice, giftgiving, personhood and the nation."
5146,不过，在两次世界大战之间，他的大量精力都花在了完善和出版在第一次世界大战中死去的同事们留下的未完成的著作。,Much of his energy in the inter-war years nevertheless was spent on completing and publishing unfinished work left by colleagues who died in the First World War.
5146,《礼物》在20世纪的人类学界被看做是最重要的单篇文本，莫斯短暂的研究生涯也一直都有人解读和仰慕。,"The Gift is seen by some as the single most important text in twentieth century anthropology, and Mauss's shorter studies also continue to be read and admired."
5146,讽刺的是，杜蒙（Dumont）回忆道 ，从未亲自做过田野调查的莫斯竟花了好几个每周专题研讨会详细讲授观察中的各种技巧。,"Ironically, recalls Dumont (1986), Mauss, who never did fieldwork himself, spent many of his weekly seminars giving detailed instructions in techniques of observation."
5147,克鲁伯在最近的著作中再次对文化学观点给予表述：“我确信，对于文化现象，首先必须根据文化条件来解释，……心理学解释并末曾使任何人在历史现象的分类方面获得很大进展，我也不能转而依赖于它。,"In a recent work, Kroeber has once again given expression to the culturological point of view: ""I am convinced that, the phenomenon being cultural, the explanation must first of all be made in cultural terms…… psychological explanations have not got anyone very far in reducing the phenomena of history to order, and I shall not fall back on them."""
5147,”但在当前的人格研究与墨迹实验中，克鲁伯几乎成孤家寡人。,"But in these days of personality studies and ink-blot tests, Kroeber stands almost alone."
5147,如何解释人类学从文化学倒退到心理学和精神病学的现象呢？,How is anthropology's regression from culturology to psychology and psychiatry to be explained?
5148,在斯图尔德的著作中（例如，Steward 1955），文化生态学的学说把文化的进化看成是不同种类的物质因素之间相互作用的一种结果：人口统计学、生态学和技术。,"In Steward's writings (see e.g.Steward 1955), cultural ecology is a doctrine about cultural evolution seen as a result of the interaction between different kinds of material factors: demography, ecology and technology."
5148,与马克思主义者不同，斯图尔德没有把生产关系当成是决定性的因素。,"Unlike Marxists, Steward did not regard relations of production as decisive."
5148,在他的文化进化的一般模型中，区别了社会文化一体化的不同水平，他的意思大致等同于本书在前面讨论过的小规模和大规模，也就是社会的不同大小和复杂程度。,"In his general model of cultural evolution, he distinguishes between different levels of sociocultural integration, by which he means roughly the same thing as in the discussion earlier in this book on small and large scale, namely the varying size and complexity of societies."
5149,我们很容易接受环境塑造文化的理论，因为它提供了解释所有文化特征的可能性，并通过环境的影响因素来阐释文化的多样性。要理解一个地区的环境就要理解该地区的文化。,"It is easy to appreciate the simple appeal of the idea that environments shape cultures.It opened up the possibility of explaining all cultural features, thereby accounting for cultural diversity, through reference to environmental influences.Understanding the environment of a region would lead to an understanding of the cultures occupying that region."
5149,相应地，早期的分析通过对不同地域的自然特色和文化类型的区分，以寻求它们之间的关联性，并根据人们所掌握的技术进行分类（如：Mason 1896)。,"Accordingly, early analyses sought correlations between areas distinguished by their natural features and types of culture, classified in terms of their technologies (for instance, Mason 1896)."
5149,亨廷顿（Huntington）（1924）认为气候是文明进步的关键影响因素，气候不仅促进了生产技术方面的发展，而且对诸如宗教信仰和仪式等也产生了积极作用。,"Huntington (1924) saw climate as the principal influence in the advancement of civilizations, not only in their more technological aspects, but also in matters such as religious belief and ritual."
5149,这种把文化与环境机械地联系在一起的做法，经常被用来指涉现实情境中多少有些含糊不清的“环境决定论”（Ellen 1982:2）或“人类地理学” （anthrogeography）（Geertz 1963:1—2），它以欧洲的拉策尔（Ratzel)(1896)、美国的菲克斯（Fewkes)(1896)和霍尔木兹（Holmes)(1919)的著作为代表。,"This mechanistic linking of culture to environment was often referred to, somewhat confusingly in the current context, as ""environmentalism"" (Ellen1982:1) or ""anthropogeography"" (Geertz 1963:1–2; Ellen 1982:2), and is represented, for instance, in the work of Ratzel (1896) in Europe and Fewkes (1896) and Holmes (1919) in America."
5150,在这些事情上，人类学和大众流行文化的看法是有分歧的。,"In these matters, anthropology and popular culture are directly at odds."
5150,大众流行文化认为我们是文化的，认为文化存在于我们之中，存在于文学、文化修养、都市现代化之中，认为自然外在于这些东西，远离城镇，存在于遥远的异国他乡和未受破坏的地方。,"Popular culture considers that we are culture, that culture is located among us, the literate,urban moderns, and that nature is somewhere out there, away from the cities and towns in the exotic and unspoiled places."
5150,游人，甚至是更加认真的冒险家，通过逃入自然来远离文化。,"Tourists, even the more serious adventurers, get away from culture by fleeing to this nature."
5151,不用说，单个人类学家无法亲身研究与人类有关的每一件事情。,"Needless to say, no single anthropologist is able to investigate personally everything that has to do with people."
5151,实际上，人类学有许多分支，个別人类学家专攻某一个或多个分支。,"For practical purposes, the discipline is divided into various subfields, and individual anthropologists specialize in one or more of these."
5151,无论他们的专长是什么，他们都保持有较宽广的、全面的有关人类的视野。,"Whatever their specialization, though, they retain a commitment to a broader, overall perspective on humankind."
5151,例如，文化人类学家专门研究人的观念、价值和行为，而体质人类学家专门研究作为生物有机体的人。然而他们都无法忽视对方的工作，因为人类文化与自然在许多重要方面联系紧密，难分难解，相互影响。,"For example, cultural anthropologists specialize in the study of human behavior, while physical anthropologists specialize in the study of humans as biological organisms.Yet neither can afford to ignore the work of the other, for human behavior and biology are inextricably intertwined, with each affecting the other in important ways."
5151,例如，我们可以看到，生物学如何影响诸如为颜色定名行为的文化习俗。,"We can see, for example, how biology affects a cultural practice such as colornaming behavior."
5152,在公众心目中，人类学通常等同于找回远古人类祖先的尸骨，发掘古代营地和“消失的城市”，或者研究现代部落民族，他们的生活方式被错误地看成是“来自过去的”某种事情。人们经常没有注意到的是人类学知识的实际应用。,"In the public mind, anthropology often is identified with the recovery of the bones of remote human ancestors, the unearthing of ancient campsites and ""10st cities"", or the study of present-day tribal peoples whose way of life is erroneously seen as something ""out of the past"" People often are unaware of the many practical applications of anthropological knowledge."
5152,应用人类学的一个领域被称为法医人类学（Forensic Anthropology) 为合法的目的专门从事人的膏骼遗体的辨别。,One field of applied anthropology—known as forensic anthropology—specializes in the identification of human skeletal remains for legal purposes.
5153,利奥泰高度成熟的殖民化观点，引发了把社会群体转变成一个与先前存在于殖民地的情形大不一样的权力关系领域的需求。,Lyautey's highly sophisticated view of colonization turned on the need to brin g social groups into a different field of power relations than had previously existed in the colonies.
5153,在他看来，这只能通过大范围的社会规划而获得，其中城市规划起着核心的作用。,"In his view, this could only be achieved through large-scale social planning, in which city planning played a central role."
5153,正如他在给他的首席设计官亨利˙普罗斯特（Henri Prost)的赞词中所说的那样：“在古典时代如此流行的城市化的艺术与科学，似乎自第二帝国时代以来已经经历了一种彻底的衰退。城市化，也就是发展人类聚集的艺术与科学，经普罗斯特而妙手回春。在这个机械化的时代里，普罗斯特是‘人文主义’的一位园丁。,"As he said in a eulogy for his chief planner, Henri Prost: ""The art and science of urbanism, so flourishing during the classical age, seems to have suffered a total eclipse since the Second Empire. Urbanism, the art and science of developing human agglomerations, is coming back to life under Prost's hand. Prost is the guardian, in this mechanical age, of ""humanism."""
5154,一个知识上的空白是什么时候被察觉的，被什么人？,"When is a gap in knowledge perceived, and by whom?"
5154,“问题”从何而来，显然这不止是发现-个错误、偏见或疏漏这样简单的问题。,"Where do ""problems"" come from ?It is obviously more than a simple matter of noticing an error, bias, or omission."
5154,我选择了两个例子（沃克和林哈特的），它们凸现了政治和历史因素对发现话语的不完全性的作用。,I have chosen examples (Walker and Lienhardt) that underline the role of political and historical factors in the discovery of discursive partiality.
5154,这一点所暗含的认识论无法与科学依靠积累而进步的观念达成一致，而利害攸关的不完全性比常规的科学指令更强大——科学要求我们一点一点地研究问题，一定不能过于概化，通过积累有力的证据建构最美的科学篇章。,"The epistemology this implies cannot be reconciled with a notion of cumulative scientific progress, and the partiality at stake is stronger than the normal scientific dictates that we study problems piecemeal, that we must not overgeneralize, that the best picture is built up by an accretion of rigorous evidence."
5154,文化不是科学的“客体”（假设这种东西真在自然科学中存在）。,"Cultures are not scientific ""objects"" (assuming such things exist, even in the natural sciences)."
5155,这种观点的一致性仍然没有改变。,So far the consensus holds.
5155,但是有一点学者们是真正存在分歧的。,But there is one quite serious point on which scholars do genuinely disagree.
5155,几乎所有的民族主义者(nationalists）都将他们本民族认同（national identity）的起源追溯到近代以前的时代。,Almost all nationalists trace the origins of their own national identity far back into the pre-modern era.
5155,问题是他们这样做对吗？,"The question is, are they right to do so?"
5155,现代民族（modem nation）可以在一无所有的条件下建立吗？或者存在一些近代之前的族裔认同（ethnic identity）供建立民族使用？,"Can modern nations be constructed ex nihilo, or does there have to be some pre-modern ethnic identity on which to build?"
5156,"布瑞格斯（Briggs 1970, 1998）在一项重要研究中提出，通过在与他人的情感冲突中个体将自己经验化为能动的过程，“因纽特儿童”成就了“因纽特人的文化”，包括制度、规则、实践、价值观、交流的习惯和含义。","In an important pair of studies, for instance, Briggs (1970, 1998) elucidates how, far from being givens, ‘Inuit children’ make ‘Inuit culture’, its institutions, rules, practices, values, habits of interaction and meanings, through processes whereby individuals experience themselves as agents engaged in emotionally charged conflicts with others."
5156,个体的因纽特儿童和因纽特文化因此相互推动。,Individual Inuit children and Inuit culture are thus mutually created.
5156,而且这一过程持续不断；个体的因纽特人从未停止作为“儿童”去创造他们的文化和身份认同（Briggs 1992）。,"Moreover, the process is ongoing; Inuit individuals never stop being ‘children’ creating their culture and their identities (Briggs 1992)."
5156,另一方面，成人认知具有流动性和交错的具体性，这与儿童的一样（Toren 1993）。,"Adult cognitions, in other words, can be expected to be as fluid, and contextually embodied, as those of children (Toren 1993)."
5157,本章的论述的重点是“相对论”  （这一术语在后现代主义兴起之前就已被人熟知）、相对论的支流（特别是认知人类学）和反相对论的某些流派。,"The main concerns of the present chapter will be with ‘relativism’ as the term was understood prior to the rise of postmodernism; with offshoots, notably cognitive anthropology; and with certain strands of anti-relativism."
5157,相对论人类学的第一 个伟大人物是 Franz 博厄斯， 他的主张基本属于描写性相对论。,"The first great relativist in anthropology was Franz Boas, whose ideas were essentially of the descriptive relativist type."
5157,业余语言学家本杰明•李• 沃尔夫是博厄斯的追随者，信奉一种认知相对论，以后的认知人类学者和民族科学家也是一样。,"His follower, amateur linguist Benjamin Lee Whorf, embraced a form of cognitive relativism, as did later cognitive anthropologists and ethnoscientists."
5158,认知相对论涉及描述性的命题，如“月亮是由绿奶酪做的”或“流行  音乐让人头痛”。它认为，就真实和虚假而言，所有关于世界的陈述都是有文化条件的，不带文化条件的陈述是完全不可能的。,"Cognitive relativism concerns descriptive propositions, like ‘The moon is made of green cheese’, or ‘Pop music causes headaches.’ It holds that in terms of truth and falsehood, all statements about the world are culturally contingent, and therefore non-culturally-contingent statements are simply not possible."
5158,换言之，所有科学都是民族的科学。,"In other words, all science is ethnoscience."
5159,尼采认为希腊悲剧中有两种因素：“日神精神”和“酒神精神”。,He had distinguished two elements of Greek tragedy: the ‘Apollonian’ and the ‘Dionysian’.
5159,日神精神指审慎、克制、和谐。酒神精神指情感、激情、无节制。,"The Apollonian aspect is that of measure, restraint, and harmony; the Dionysian aspect, that of emotion, passion, and excess."
5159,尼采认为在希腊悲剧中两者并存，而本尼迪克特认为在北美印第安人文化中两者不能并存。,"Greek tragedy, according to Nietzsche, had both.American Indian cultures, according to Benedict, have one or the other."
5160,"今天,他们为保持他们作为独特民族的身份，为了觅新获得对他们土地自然资源的控制权，仍在通过非军事手段继续斗争。如果人们在面对强大的外部统治的时候能够依然坚持自己的一些传统，那么结果可能（syncretism)。这是指本土元素和异族元素混合而形成的一个新的系统。关于这种现象的一个较好的例子是特罗布里恩德岛民所玩的板球运动，关于这个民族的一些习俗，我们在第七、八章和第九章已经考察过了。","Sometimes, though, people have managed to keep faith with their traditions by inventing creative and ingenious ways to express them in the face of powerful foreign domination.This blending of indigenous and foreign elements into a new system is known as syncretism, and a fine illustration of it is the game of cricket as played by the Trobriand Islanders, some of whose practices we looked at in Chapters 7, 8, and 9."
5161,阿诺尔德·范·根纳普在人类学的一本经典著作中分析了生命礼仪，种仪式帮助个人度过他们生命中的重要关头，比如出生、青春期、结婚为人父母、踏入史高阶层、职业专业化以及死亡。,"In one of anthropology's classic works, Arnold Van Gennep analyzed the rites of passage that help individuals through the crucial crises of their lives, such as birth, puberty, marriage, parenthood, advancement to a higher class, occupational specialization, and death."
5161,他发现，将所有谊些为生命关口准备的典礼分为三个阶段：分离（separation)、过渡（transition)和融入（incorporation)——是有用的。,"He found it useful to divide ceremonies for all of these life crises into three stages: separation, transition, and incorporation."
5161,个人首先会被仪式性地从社会整体中排除出去，然后隔离上一段时期，最后重新融入社会，获得其新地位。,"The individual first would be ritually removed from the society as a whole, then isolated for a period, and finally incorporated back into society in his or her new status."
5162,所有文化都是习得的而不是生物学遗传的，著名的人类学家拉尔夫·林顿把这称为人的“社会遗传”。,"All culture is learned rather than biologically inherited, prompting anthropologist Ralph Linton to refer to it as humanity ""social heredity""."
5162,人们与文化一起成长，因而学会自己的文化，文化借以从 一代人传递到下一代人的过程被称为濡化（enculturation）。,"People learn their culture by growing up with it, and the process whereby culture is transmitted from one generation to the next is called enculturation."
5162,大多数动物每当冲动产生就要吃喝。,Most animals eat and drink whenever the urge arises.
5162,然而，濡化了的人类在某种文化规定的时间进餐和饮水，而且在那些时间到来时感到饥饿。,"Humans, however, do most of their eating and drinking at certain culturally prescribed rimes and feel hungry as those times approach."
5162,这些进餐时间各种文化各不相同。同样，吃什么、如何安排吃、怎样吃，各种文化也不一样。,"These eating times vary from culture to culture, as does what is eaten and how it is eaten."
5163,另外一个例子是巴西玛瑙斯的奥尼格罗的文化宫殿，最近举办了一个盛大的亚马逊民族文化展，并组织了一个名为“身份的表达和民族的主张”的节日来歌颂其文化的真实性。,"There is also the example from the Cultural Palace of the Rio Negro in Manaus, which recently engaged in a great cultural display of Amazonian ethnicity and a eulogy of its cultural authenticity in a festival entitled ""Expressions of Identity and Ethnic Affirmation""."
5163,还有一个例子是雅诺马人的撒满教和马鲁波（Marubo)的阿雅瓦斯卡（一种至幻药品）仪式。,"There was an example of Yanomami shamanism, and an ayawaska (hallucinatory drug) ritual of the Marubo."
5163,其中有讲述神话、唱圣歌、仪式舞蹈表演和播放本地节日录像等。,"There was myth-telling, and chanting, ritual dances performed and videos of indigenous festivals shown."
5163,亚马逊大学管弦乐队甚至还演奏了名为“面具之舞”的奏鸣曲。,"A sonata was even performed by the University of Amazonas orchestra, entitled ""The Dance of the Masks""."
5164,第二类辅助语言的声音是由发嗓音（vocalimtiorus）构成的。,The second kind of paralinguistic noises consists of vocalizations.
5164,这些嗓音是实际可辨别的声音，而不是基本特点。与音质不同，它们是在可觉察的和相对短的音程中出现和消失的。,"Rather than background characteristics, these are actual identifiable noises that, unlike voice qualities, are turned on and off at perceivable and relatively short intervals."
5164,但是它们与语言的语音是分开的。,"They are, nonetheless, separate from language sounds."
5164,发嗓音的一个类别是嗓音特征表露（vocal characterizes）:笑或哭，喊叫或低语，打哈欠或打哺等声音。,"One category of vocalizations is vocal characterizers: the sounds of laughing or crying, yelling or whispering, yawning or belching, and the like."
5165,但是我们却要依靠这种抽象去进行人类学中可能的比较，即使它并不构成本土文化范畴中的任何部分。,"We nevertheless depend on this kind of abstraction for comparison to be possible in anthropology, even if it does not form part of native cultural categories."
5165,原则上说，资本主义经济只认可一种商品交换的形式，也就是基于供需法则的市场交换。,"In principle, a capitalist economy recognises only one form of commodity exchange, namely market exchange based on the laws of supply and demand."
5165,"在特罗布里恩德人中，大量的交换形式（根据Davis 1992b，大约有80种），都被包括在我们理解为“贸易”的形式里，而其中一些最著名的列举如下：吉姆瓦利（Gimwali）是市场交换，类似于资本主义的商品交换。,","Among the Trobrianders, a multitude of forms of exchange (about 80, according to Davis 1992b) are included in what we would translate as 'trade', and some of the most famous varieties are the following.Gimwali is market exchange, reminiscent of capitalistic commodity exchange."
5166,在哲学上，人类解释上的同义反复或循环的特点被称为“解释循环”。,"In philosophical deliberation, the tautological or circular nature of human interpretation has become known as ‘the hermeneutic circle’."
5166,对人而言，除了事物的熵和流量外，还没有什么是必定或简单的存在于世界“那儿”。,"For human beings, there is nothing that is necessarily or simply ‘there’ in the world besides the entropy of matter, or flux."
5166,存在的只是我们所期望在那的，且只有通过特定的参与活动，我们才可作出有意义的解释，并就此“稳固”我们的世界。,"What is there is a matter of what we anticipate to be there, and only by courtesy of a system of anticipations do we make meaningful interpretations and hence ‘fix’ our world."
5166,所以伽达默尔认为：“是我们的成见造就了我们的存在”（Gadamer 1976: 9）。,Hence Gadamer’s conclusion: ‘it is our prejudices that constitute our being’ (1976:9).
5167,另一种观点认为，本族语言使用者认为最能表达出词的意思的（当然在形式上也是正确的）分析，才是最好的分析。,"There is a place for the alternative view that the best is precisely the one which is most meaningful to the native speaker (while also being formally correct, of course)."
5167,如果他们反对这种分析方法，那么这一方法就是错误的。,"If native speakers disagree about which one this may be, then so be it."
5167,这个问题的争论被称为“上帝真理与魔法的大对局”。“上帝真理”主张人们探究认知现实，而“魔法”对这种探知的可行性持怀疑态度。,"The debate which ensued on this issue is called that of ‘God’s truth versus hocuspocus’, with the ‘God’s truth’ side favouring the search for cognitive reality and the ‘hocus-pocus’ side maintaining a scepticism of this very possibility."
5168,把伊斯兰教徒视作一个少数者群体，会使14世纪的历史遭到多处修改。宗教允许个人从零开始：它是一部法典，不是文化；使用任何语言并生活在任何社会中的人，可以通过学习成为信徒。,"To think of Islam as a minority group entails more than a few adjustments with 14 centuries of history.Religion allows one to start from nothing: it is a code, not a culture; one can learn to be a believer, using any language and living in any society."
5168,宗教现在是新发明的“族性”的标识，没有文化，但表达了一个寻求认可的重建的身份。,"Religion is now the marker of a new invented ""ethnicity"", void of culture, but expressing a reconstructed identity in search of recognition."
5169,供养能力和社会密度都是复杂的变量。,Both carrying capacity and social density are complex variables.
5169,供养能力不仅包括食物和水的即时存在，而且包括获得它们所必要的工具和劳动，以及在其可获得性方面的短期和长期波动。,"Carrying capacity involves not only the immediate presence of food and water but also the tools and work necessary to secure them, as well as short- and long-term fluctuations in their availability."
5169,社会密度不仅包括人数和他们的互动，也包括那些互动的环境和性质以及调节互动的机制。,"Social density involves not only the number of people and their interactions but also the circumstances and quality of those interactions, as well as the mechanisms for regulating them."
5169,由100个发怒的陌生人形成的人群与在街区上自娱自乐的同样数量的邻居有不同的社会密度。,
5170,于是，人们的注意力转移到了这些分析的更宽广的背景上，并越来越依赖于沟通理论和转型思维，例如克劳德·列维-斯特劳斯的作品中已经出现的那样——尽管列维-斯特劳斯的影响只是慢慢地渗入到英国传统中。在英国人类学家中出现了一种持久的不安，即人类学理论不能处理处理社会变化的问题。,"Consequently attention shifted to a broader framing of such analyses, increasingly based on theories of communication and in transformational thinking such as had already emerged in the work of Claude Lévi-Strauss—though Lévi-Strauss's influence only slowly penetrated into the British tradition.A persistent disquiet arose among British anthropologists over the inability of anthropological theory to handle questions of social change."
5170,在马林诺夫斯基的文化范式里，这个问题被认为是文化接触的事情：大体上，思想的影响以及文化整体的解体被当作外部力量侵入的后果。,"In Malinowski's cultural paradigm the issue was thought of as a matter of culture contact: mainly, the effects of ideas and the breakdown of cultural integration as a consequence of the intrusion of outside forces."
5171,社会工作者和传教士在走出去做好事、给予帮助，以及可能的宗教救赎上与医师非常相似。,"The social worker and the missionary resemble the physician in that they are out to do good, to give aid, and perhaps ultimately religious salvation."
5171,社会工作者经常被限制在他们的办公室。,Social workers are normally more confined to their offices.
5171,传教士则会进入田野领域很长时间，并且会比我们能想到的任何其他类型的人们作出更多自我牺牲；实际上，许多最好的民族志一直都是由传教士完成的。,"Missionaries move into the midst of the field for longer periods and with more complete commitment of self than any other people of the types we have considered; in fact, much of the best ethnography has been done by missionaries."
5172,这些日常使用的术语的形而上学的分量超越了我们西方的“生物学”关系或通过婚姻缔结的社会联系的观念。,"The terms, as used in everyday life, have metaphysical weight that goes well beyond our Western notions of ""biological"" relationship or a social relation through marriage."
5172,每个术语在使用中都具有共享或不共享一系列社会的、道德的、或形而上学的特质的可能性，在给定的情景中，任何术语都不能被优先确保其显要性。,"Each term in its application carries with it possibilities of sharing or not sharing a bundle of social, moral, or metaphysical qualities, and there is no a priori guarantee which will be salient to a given case."
5172,这些关系的性质，比如抚养、教育、背叛、竞争或掠夺，经常过度强调了一种更加注重身体的联系。,"The quality of the relationship, as for instance one of nurturing, teaching, treachery, competition or predation, often overrides a more physical sort of relating."
5173,寻食调适的另一个特点是小规模的地方群体，通常不多于100人。,"Another characteristic of the food-foraging adaptation is the small size of local groups, which usually include fewer than 100 people."
5173,虽然我们还没有对群体规模提出完全令人满意的说明，但它涉及生态和社会这两个因素似乎是肯定的在所提到的因素中有土地的供养能力（carrying capacity），或者在一定的获取食物的技术水平上，那些可获取的资源所能供养的人数，以及社会关系密度（density of social relations），或者大体说来，营地成员的人数及成员之间互动的强度。,"Although no completely satisfactory explanation of group size has yet been offered, it seems certain that both ecological and social factors are involved.Among those suggested are the carrying capacity of the land, or the number of people who the available resources can support at a given level of food-getting techniques, and the density of social relations, or roughly the number and intensity of interactions among camp members."
5173,人数较多意味着较高的社会密度，反过来说，这也意味着较多的冲突机会。,"More people means a higher social density, which, in turn, means more opportunities for conflict."
5174,在此，社会化和早期的习得拥有其最深厚的根基。此时，文化在个体身上进行编码，而个体则成为传递和表达文化编码（如服饰与性别、规则与标准、控制与主导）的记忆承载媒介。,"It is here that socialization and early learning put down their deepest roots; it is here that culture becomes encoded on the individual body, and the body becomes a mnemonic device for the communication and expression of cultural codes (of dress and gender; of propriety and normalcy; of control and domination)."
5174,在这一介于两端之间的习惯的领域中亦可发现社会交往中的资质：个体不假思索的正确行动。,Competency in social interaction is also to be found in the habitual domain between the two poles: individuals act properly by not thinking about it.
5174,简而言之，人类行为中的习惯，其广泛来源正是外部的限定条件和制度性因素决定过程中的各种可能性的汇聚。,"In short, the wide provenance of habit in human behaviour is a conduit for the potency of processes of exterior determination and institutionalization."
5175,社会阶级可以被定义为这样一类个体:根据评价体系，他们拥有平等或几乎平等的声望。,A social class may be defined as a category of individuals of equal or nearly equal prestige according to the system of evaluation.
5175,“几乎平等”这一限定语非常重要，因为甚至在一个既定的阶级中，可能也有一定程度的不平等。,"The qualification ""nearly equal"" is important，for a certain amount of inequality may occur even within a given class."
5175,如果事实确实如此的话，那么在一个外部观察者看来，上层阶级中地位比较低的个体与下层阶级中地位最髙的个体并没有太大的不同。,"If this is so, to an outside observer low ranking individuals in an upper class may not seem much different from the highest ranking members of a lower class."
5175,然而，当阶级作为整体与另一个阶级加以比较时，就有很明显的差异。,Yet marked differences exist when the classes are compared as wholes with one another.
5175,这里的关键点：在像北美那样的一些社会中，阶级差别并不泾渭分明，在这些社会有一连续系列的级差特权，例如，从完全没有特权到有几项特权。,"The point here is that class distinctions are not clear-cut and obvious in societies such as those of North America that have a continuous range of differential privileges, for example, from virtually none to several."
5176,林顿写作这本书的目的旨在提供一个关于人类学领域的一般的考察。,Linton wrote this book in 1936 with the intention of providing a general survey of anthropology.
5176,他关于社会结构的研究，在今天仍然具有启发性。,His study of social structure is still illuminating today.
5176,本书被人们视为经典，而且历来是一本重要的参考书。,This book is regarded as a classic and is an important source historically.
5177,在社会科学（包括人类学在内）理论的重要转变时期，发生这样的事情并不奇怪，比如，在20世纪60—70年代就发生过。,"This has tended to happen, notsurprisingly, during important fundamental shifts in social science theory, in which anthropology has participated.It happened, for instance, during the 1960s and 1970s."
5177,当时，人类学与其他社会科学一样，通过结构主义的各种理论形式，正在摆脱一直占主导地位的实证主义的束缚，朝着更加解释性的研究方向发展。,"At this time, anthropology, like the other social sciences, was shedding the cloak of positivism which it had worn conspicuously throughout its domination by various forms of structuralist theory, and moving towards a more interpretative approach."
5177,接着，评述文化反思现状（Bohamian 1973，KeeSing 1974)的各类刊物开始发表关于文化本质的论述（Geertz 1966，Goodepough 1957，1981/1971)。,"Pronouncements about the nature ofculture (Geertz 1966, Goodenough 1957, 1981 [1971]) were followed by publications which assessed the contemporary state of thinking on culture (Bohannan 1973, Keesing 1974)."
5178,当然，总的来说，对语言的这样一种兴趣早在泰勒之前就有了，但是在19世纪和20世纪早期，这种兴趣更多地被当作各种各样的民族主义文艺的理论和教育(参见Eagleton 1983:ch.2)，而非其他人文科学的中心内容。,"In a general way, of course, such an interest in language predates Tylor, but in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries it tended to be central to varieties of nationalist literary theory and education (cf. Eagleton 1983: ch. 2) rather than to the other human sciences."
5178,对英国社会人类学而言，这一兴趣是在什么时候、以什么方式变得至关重要起来了呢？,When and in what ways did it become crucial for British social anthropology?
5178,我不打算在此尝试描画这样一段历史，而只是想提醒我们自己，“文化翻译”这个短语，这一从1950年代起逐渐变成了对社会人类学这份独特工作的一种几近陈腐的描述，显然并不一直是对社会人类学工作的描述。,"I do not intend to attempt such a history here, but merely to remind ourselves that the phrase ""the translation of cultures,"" which increasingly since the 1950s has become an almost banal description of the distinctive task of social anthropology, was not always so much in evidence."
5178,我想强调，这个明显的转化与过去的前功能主义/功能主义时期的划分是不一样的。,I want to stress that this apparent shift is not identical with the old pre-Functionalism/Functionalism periodization.
5179,因此，超越行动或反行动意味着具有一定约束力甚至是强制性的结构，存在并超越于特定个体的行动之上，并导致个体演绎一定的社会文化规则。,"Over and against action, therefore, were certain structures which implied constraint, even coercion, and which existed and endured over and above the actions of particular individuals, lending to individuals' acts a certain social and cultural regularity."
5179,因此社会科学要研究的是，这样的正式结构如何产生并怎样精确规约个体行为。,"What social science should study, therefore, was how such formal structures were created and how precisely they determined individual behaviour."
5179,“能动性”存在的范围，简而言之，是从一定的集体表象中抽取出来的特质并属于之：在是非观念集结的社会事实中；仅存在于他们未被社会化之前，动物特点 (社会文化环境下的某种病态）即是个体能够发起的未被先验决定的行动。,"To the extent that ""agency"" existed, in short, it was a quality which derived from, and resided in, certain collective representations: in the social fact of a conscience collective; only in their pre-socialized, animal nature (a pathological state within a socio-cultural milieu) were individuals able to initiate action which was not predetermined in this way."
5180,克鲁伯在《社会心理学的可能性》一文中，指出了“社会学”这个用语的“致命缺点”，它不能把社会现象和文化现象分离开来。,"Kroeber has pointed out in ""The Possibility of a Social Psychology"" ""the fatal defect"" of the term ""sociology"": its failure to distinguish the cultural from the social."
5180,但是，在校正这个缺点方面，他却没做什么事情。因为，正是在揭露社会学缺点的这同一篇论文之中，他建议，应把文化的科学叫作“文化机械论”、“社会心理学”甚至“社会学”。,"But he does little to remedy this shortcoming, since in the same essay where the defect of ""sociology"" is exposed, he suggests that the science of culture be called ""cultural mechanics,"" ""social psychology,"" and even ""sociology."""
5180,他要是能把他的思想凝聚在“文化学”这个新术语上，情况就会好得多。,"If only he could have crystallized his thought in a new term: ""culturology""!"
5180,但在以后的论文中，他的确使用了“文化的科学”这个短语，而且，当他断言：“看来，未来的科学关心文化将甚于关心社会”时， 也表现出对科学正在确定的方向有敏锐的理解力。,"In a later essay, he does use the phrase ""science of culture,"" however.And he displays a keen understanding of the direction that science is taking when he observes: ""It does look as if the future science would be more concerned with culture than with society."""
5181,现在，实证主义和阐释观点在人类学和社会科学内都可以找到，伴随着各自大量的阴影和着色。,"Now, within anthropology and the social sciences are found both the positivist and the interpretive viewpoints, with myriad shadings and colorings of each."
5181,不过，简单来说，我们可以认为，实证主义在社会科学(心理学、社会学、经济学）中占据主导地位，阐释则在民族志中占有主导地位。,"Simplifying, however, we can identify the dominant viewpoint in the social sciences – psychology, sociology, economics – as positivist and an influential viewpoint in ethnography as interpretive."
5181,实证主义社会学家和阐释民族志学者之间一个有些被夸张的对比，有助于突出其各自特有的逻辑。,A somewhat overstated contrast between the positivist social scientist and the interpretive ethnographer serves to highlight the distinctive logic of each.
5182,对考尔徳（R˙H˙Gaut)来说，社会心理学“不过是个人心理学的一个侧面而已。,"To R. H. Gault, social psychology is but ""an aspect of the psychology of the individual."""
5182,”可见，心理学固然能够伸展它的领域，多少认识到行为中的社会因素，但是，它却又如此牢固地被限定在作为其研究对象的个人之上，不能把自己解脱出来，转而面对由众多个人所组成的心理学体系，而不是作为社会有机体和生物有机体的单个的个人。,"Thus psychology was able to reach out and at least take cognizance of social factors in behavior.But it was so firmly anchored to the individual as its object of study that it was unable to free itself and envisage a psychological system composed of many individuals instead of only one, a social organism as well as a biological one."
5182,因此这个领域给社会学家遗留下相当多的难题。,This field was left therefore pretty much to the sociologists.
5183,在第三章，我讨论了道格拉斯关于社会组织与人们理解自然环境之关系的观点。,"In Chapter 3, I discussed Douglas’ views on the relationship between social organization and people's understanding of thenatural environment."
5183,许多人类学家都不会接受她的主张，即社会组织形式引起人们以某种方式思考自然，但是，人类社会为人们理解另一个世界(冥界）提供各种模式的观点却被广泛接受。,"While many anthropologists would not accept her assertion that forms of social organization cause people to think about nature in certain ways, the view that human society provides models for understanding the world beyond is quite widely held."
5183,比如，上述伯尔德的研究中就谈到这一点。,"It is expressed, for instance, in the work of Bird-David referred to above."
5183,狩猎一采集社会通过社会关系：为他们提供的框架来描述他们与其环境之间的互动。,Social relationships provide the framework through which selected hunter-gatherer communities describe their interaction with their environment.
5183,人们一直认为这种分析曲解了我们所描述的文化。,This kind of analysis has been seen as misrepresenting the cultures being described.
5183,英戈尔德认为它是对西方社会与自然二分法的复制，而这种分类在狩猎一采集文化中是被否认的（Ingold 1992b:42)。,Ingold argued that it reproduces a western dichotomy between society and nature which is denied by hunter-gatherer cultures (Ingold 1992b:42).
5183,理查德（1993)认为人们对其环境的理解至少有一部分來自于直接经验性的观察。,Richards (1993) argued that at least some of what people know about their environment comes from direct empirical observation.
5184,方言研究是社会语言学（sociolinguistics)研究的一个方面。,
5184,从技术方面看，所有的方言都是语言——在语言方面，没有什么分语言或次语言这种东西——而且两种不同方言成为不同语言的关键点，人致在于说一种方言的人几乎不能与 、说其他方言的人交流这一点。,"Technically, all dialects are languages—they have nothing partial or sublinguistic about them一and at the point two dialects become distinctly different languages is roughly where speakers of one are almost totally unable to communicate with speakers of the other."
5184,分界线可能在心理、地理、社会或经济的方面，而这 方面往往不是很清楚。,"Boundaries may be psychological, geographic, social, or economic, and they are not always very clear."
5185,人类学以研究文化变迁的细节著称， 但同时也因其忽略全景，不能应对大规模的社会运动和世界性交流而闻名。,"Anthropology has become famous for analysing the minutiae of cultural change, but equally famous for ignoring the big picture, for failing to cope with large-scale social movements and worldwide communications systems."
5185,很显然，这意味着除了个别情况之外，人类学家在全球化辩论中的作用微乎其微。,"Not surprisingly, this failing has meant that, with a few exceptions, anthropologists have played little part in the debate over globalization."
5185,人类学无力创建大规模的文化变迁模式可以部分地归结到人类学思维的两个最为突出的特征上：文化是制度的假说和文化相对主义的“幽灵”（Holy 和 Stuchlik 1981:28)。,"The failure to develop models of large-scale cultural change can be attributed in part to two prevailing features of anthropological thought: the assumption that cultures are systems, and the ""spectre"" (Holy and Stuchlik 1981:28) of cultural relativism."
5186,于是演讲者就能够暂时取代社会的正式领导，而以一种群众自身愿意接受的方式来统治人群。,Thus the orator temporarily replaced the official leader of society and governed the crowd in a way the crowd itself willed and accepted.
5186,虽然勒庞谈论的人群因此都威胁到了社会秩序，但人群本身却并非无政府主义的。,"Although Le Bon's crowd therefore threatened the social order, it was not itself anarchic."
5186,勒庞从这种模型中看到了社会主义失败的一种原因，因为它将自身的运动建基于典型人群不会去倾听的理性论证之上。,"Le Bon saw in this model a reason for the failure of socialism, because it based its campaigns on rational arguments that the typical crowd will not listen to."
5187,印象管理的观念被巴思吸收并应用在对一艘离开西挪威的拖网渔船上的工作人员的社会组织研究上（Barth 1966)。,The notion of impression management has been taken up by Fredrik Barth in his study of the social organisation of the crew of a trawler off western Norway (Barth 1966).
5187,船上有一位船长，5到8个渔民水手，还有一个“渔网指挥（netboss)”。,"The boat has a captain, a crew of five to eight fishermen, and a ""netboss""."
5187,他们所有人都具有多重身份，但在渔船上，他们的职业身份远比其他身份重要得多。,"All of them have a variety of statuses, but in the boat their professional statuses are by far the most important."
5187,不同部门的行动者具有不同的任务，船长的工作是掌舵和监督 其他人广渔网指挥”被指望发现渔群和命令渔民下网，当他“觉得”水下有大量的鱼的时候；而渔民的任务是，完成所有的体力活儿。,"Each category of actors has specified tasks.The captain's job is to steer the boat and to supervise the others.The ""netboss"" is expected to find schools of fish and to order the fishermen to drop the net when he ""feels"" that there are large amounts of fish down below.The fishermen, for their part, carry out all the manual work."
5188,在美国农业经济局（U.S. Bureau of Agricultural Economics) 领导下开展的大萧条时期的计划资助了许多人类学家对乡村社区的研究，这些研究的目的是让政府机构知晓美国农业的状况。,Depression-era programs under the U.S. Bureau of Agricultural Economics underwrote a number of anthropologists' studies of rural communities for the purpose of informing government agencies about conditions in American agriculture.
5188,这些报告中的绝大多数都未发表，但少数报告，如卡尔˙威瑟斯对中西部 “普雷维勒”的研究（Withers 1945)成了新兴的社区研究文献的一部分。,"Most of the reports remained unpublished, but a few, such as Carl Withers's study of ""Plainville,"" in the Midwest (1945), became part of the emerging community-study literature."
5188,值得特别注意的是沃尔特˙戈尔德施密特（Walter Goldschmidt) 对加州中部谷地的农业企业的研究（1947)， 它无疑是第一次以工业化农业生产的影响为核心来对乡村社会进行的人类学分析。,"Of special note was Walter Goldschmidt's research on agribusiness in the Central Valley of California (1947), which was surely the first anthropological analysis of rural society to focus on the impact of industrial agricultural production."
5188,这项研究被新政拥护者用以抵制集体土地所有者为了其自身的利益而要求修改法律的努力。在这一过程中，戈尔德施密特成为了政治攻击的靶子。,"The study was used by New Dealers to repel an effort by corporate landholders to rewrite law to their own benefit; in the process, Goldschmidt became the target of political attacks."
5189,在人类学和社会学中，一个行动着的人常常被称为行动者（actor或agent），这个术语也包括集体行动者，因而比“个体”、“个人”这样的词汇更加具有包容性。,"In anthropology and sociology, an acting person is frequently spoken of as an actor (or agent).This term can also include collective actors and is therefore more encompassing than words like ""person"", ""individual"" and so on."
5189,比如说，国家可以说是一个行动者，更进一步，在人类学研究中，社团也常作为一个行动者而出现。,"The state, for example, may be an actor.Further, corporations frequently appear as actors in anthropological studies."
5189,从一个或多个角度来看，社团是作为行动单位的人的集合体。,A corporation is a collective of humans which appears as an acting unit in one or several regards.
5189,在许多社会，政治党派和贸易团体是典型的行动者；在另一些社会，亲属群体构成了社团（参见第五、第七和第十一章）。,"In many societies, political parties and trade unions are typical actors; in others, kin groups make up corporations (see Chapters 5, 7 and 11)."
5190,各种社会制度和各种身份关系的整体构成了社会的结构。,The totality of social institutions and status relationships makes up the social structure of society.
5190,在某种意义上下列假定已经成为一种常识：该结构独立于在任何地点及时而凑巧地填补了特定位置的个体而存在。拉德克利夫˙布朗在一次著名的报告中表述如下：汤姆、迪克和哈利的实际关系或杰克和吉尔的行为可能在我们的田野笔记本中被记述下来，并且可以为总体描述提供例证。,"It has been common to assume that this structure, in a certain sense, exists independently of the individuals who at any point in time happen to fill particular positions.Radcliffe Brown expressed it like this in a famous statement: The actual relations of Tom, Dick and Harry or the behaviour of Jack and Jill may go down in our field note-books and may provide illustrations for a general description."
5190,但是从科学的目的来看，我们需要的是对结构形式的解释。,But what we need for scientific purposes is an account of the form of the structure.
5190,"(1952,p.192)","(1952, p. 192)"
5191,我后面将要说到，社会这一概念也面临过同样的批判，然而不管它们看起来可能多么成问题，文化和社会这两个概念仍然形成了人类学概念框架的中枢部分。,"As I shall indicate later, the concept of society has been subjected to similar critiques, but problematic as they may be, both concepts still seem to form part of the conceptual backbone of anthropology."
5191,"亚当·库珀（Kuper 1999,p.226）在他那官气十足而又极其矛盾的文化概念评论中提到，“最近，人类学家们在谈到文化的时候变得异常不安——这很奇怪，尽管从表面上看，文化的人类学已颇有几分成名史的色彩。","In his magisterial, deeply ambivalent review of the culture concept, Adam Kuper (1999, p. 226) notes that these days, anthropologists get remarkably nervous when they discuss culture – which is surprising, on the face of it, since the anthropology of culture is something of a success story."
5191,”这里所说的 “不安”，其原因不仅在于文化这个其含义备受争论的术语，还在于那些与经典人类学有同类性质的文化观念被身份政治从政治上加以利用的事实（参见第十七章到十九章）。,"The reason for this ""nervousness"" is not just the contested meaning of the term culture, but also the fact that culture concepts that are close kin to the classic anthropological one are being exploited politically, in identity politics (see Chapters 17–19)."
5192,姿势一呼叫系统中的姿势成分由传达意义的姿势、面部表情和身体动作组成。,"The gestural component of the gesture-call system consists of postures, facial expressions, and bodily motions that convey messages."
5192,标记和分析这种“肢体语言”的方法通常被称为身势学（kinesics）。,The method for notating and analyzing this body language is known as kinesics.
5192,"就姿势来说, 身势信息可以直接传播。","Kinesic messages may be communicated directly, such as gestures do."
5192,例如，在北美，搔头皮、咬嘴唇，或皱眉是表达怀疑的方式。,"For example, in North America scratching one^ scalp, biting one's lip，or knitting one's brows are ways of conveying doubt."
5192,由北美男人和女人发送的性别信号提供了一个比较复杂的例子。,More complex examples are the gender signals North American men and women send.
5192,虽然有一些地位和阶级的差别，但当妇女站立时一般双腿并拢，有时大腿适当交叉，或者整条腿相交，足部仍并拢，脚外部相互平行，或者站立时，膝盖对着膝盖。,"Although some regional and class variation occurs, women when standing generally bring their legs together, at times to the point the upper legs cross, either in a full leg cross with feet still together, the outer sides of the feet parallel to each other, or in standing knee over knee."
5193,在一个熟悉或较为熟悉的环境里，你的优势是比在一个有文化距离的地方更熟悉语言和文化习俗，但是也更容易把太多东西想当然，这个问题有时被叫做“身在庐山的盲目”（homeblindness），至少在很大程度上，这个问题可以通过适当的训练而得到克服。,"In a familiar or semi-familiar setting, one has the advantage of mastering the language and cultural conventions better than in a culturally distant place, but one also tends to take too much for granted.This problem is sometimes called ""homeblindness"", and it can, at least to a great extent, be overcome through proper training."
5193,对文化多样性的详细的比较研究，是人类学家所受教育的核心，它也使我们能够用与研究遥远社会大致相同的方法和分析工具研究我们自以为熟悉的社会。,"The comparative, detailed study of cultural variation which forms the core of the education of an anthropologist enables us to study societies we believe to be familiar with roughly the same methods and analytical apparatus we would apply to distant societies."
5193,当现代人类学在20世纪早期已经成型的时候，世界上仍然有大片地区是欧洲人很少涉足的，更别提进行系统研究了。,"When modern anthropology took shape in the early years of the twentieth century, there were still large areas of the world that had hardly been visited by Europeans, much less been subjected to systematic exploration."
5194,可是更准确地讲，记忆和预测都是关于当前的紧张形态。,
5194,,"But then, memory and anticipation are more properly seen as tensed modalities of the present."
5194,也就是说，上述两个方面不是相分离的，而是存在于当前的一个具有张力的实体之中；连续不断的经历将吸收记忆的历史和预测的细节从而对具体的现实进行深描，这样我们的身份认同就会延续下去（即使并不连续）。,"That is, the above two stories are not separate but exist as a tensed unity in the present; an ongoing story absorbs the chronicle of memory and the scenario of anticipation into the thick description of an embodied present, so that our identity remains continuous (even if not coherent)."
5194,在我们对自我和他者的描述中，当前成为记忆中的过去和预期未决的未来之间，具有决定意义的时刻、决策的时刻和危机时刻。,"The present becomes the decisive moment in our story of self and other, the moment of decision, and of crisis, between the remembered past and the anticipated but undetermined future."
5195,第二卷的题目是《拉科塔社会》（Walker 1982b)，集中了与社会组织各方面和与时间、历史概念大致相关的文献。,"The second volume to have appeared is Lakota Society (1982b), which assembles documents roughly relating to aspects of social organization, as well as concepts of time and history."
5195,此书包括了大量“冬季合计”(Winter Counts)（拉科塔记录）和历史事件的个人回忆，这与质疑过于清晰地划分“有”历史和“没有”历史的人民的最近趋向一致（Rosddo1980；Price 1983)。,"The inclusion of extensive Winter Counts (Lakota annals) and personal recollections of historical events confirms recent tendencies to question overly clear distinctions between peoples ""with"" and ""without"" history (Rosaldo 1980; Price 1983)."
5195,第三卷是《拉科塔神话》(Walker l983）最后一卷将包括译成英文的索德作品。,Volume three is Lakota Myth (1983).And the last will contain the translated writings of George Sword.
5195,乔治˙索德是一位奧格拉拉武士，后成为松树岭的印第安人犯罪法庭（Court of Indian Offenses)的法官。,"Sword was an Oglal a warrior, later a judge of the Court of Indian Offenses at Pine Ridge."
5195,在沃克的鼓励之下，他详细地记录了当地的习俗生活，包括神话、仪式、战争与游戏，并附有他的自传,"With Walker's encouragement, he wrote a detailed vernacular record of customary life, covering myth, ritual, warfare and games, complemented by an autobiography."
5196,这张不同凡响的照片仅在两年前才出版——是我们时代的标志而不是他的时代的，我们不是从参与观察或(适合于阐释的）文化文本开始的，而是从写作、从制作文本开始的。,"This remarkable picture was only published two years ago — a sign of our times, not his.We begin, not with participant-observation or with cultural texts (suitable for interpretation), but with writing, the making of texts."
5196,写作不再是边缘或神秘的一维，而是作为人类学家在田野之中及之后工作的核心出现。,"No longer a m arginal, or occulted, dimension, writing has emerged as central to what anthropologists do both in the held and thereafter."
5196,人们直到最近才描绘或严肃地探讨写作，这一事实反映了主张再现的透明性和经验的直接性之意识形态的顽强。,The fact that it has not until recently been portrayed or seriously discussed reflects the persistence of an ideology claiming transparency of representation and immediacy of experience.
5196,。按照这意识形态，写作被而化为方法：做好田野笔记.精确绘制地图，“详细描写”结果。,"Writing reduced to method: keeping good field notes, making accurate maps, ""writing up "" results."
5197,在人类历史中，人类起源和进化的故事尤为多产。每种文化都有其人类创造的神话，而且都会有进化故事出现（当然也有与之竞争的学说，例如神造论）。,"Stories of human origins and evolution abound in human history.Every culture has its myth of human creation, and the story of evolution is within this genre(as also are competing doctrines,such as Creationism)."
5197,但进化论并不仅仅是一个故事，它是一个科学表达的理论，因此它可以激发人们进行研究。,"But evolutionism is not only a story, it is a theory couched scientifically so that it stimulates research."
5197,植物学家和地质学家与体质人类学家和考古学家通力合作，一起挖掘，加入所谓的跨学科团队工作，构建对未发现的过去的系统整合。,"Botanists and geologists cooperate with physical anthropologists and archeologists as they all swarm around the dig, joining in so-called interdisciplinary teamwork to construct holistic syntheses of a past uncovered."
5198,正统马克思主义之应用于人类学，正如在苏联所展现的情况那样，从这种观点来看，并没能超越对摩尔根划分的发展阶段的教条性接受，而这种观点早就被其他的人类学学派拋弃并归人本学科的历史之中了。,"Orthodox Marxism's treatment of anthropology as purveyed in the Soviet Union had not, in this view, gone beyond a doctrinaire acceptance of Morgan's phases of development, which other anthropological schools had long since relegated to the historyof the discipline."
5198,此外，尽管法国的马克思主义人类学家们很热爱摩尔根的人类学以及马克思本人的民族志笔记，但对他们来说，无论是马克思还是恩格斯都显然没有真正理解前资本主义社会，虽然他们能够接触到的人类学材料非常具有基础性作用。,"In addition, despite French Marxist anthropologists' love of Morgan's anthropology and of Marx's own ethnological notebooks, it was clear that neither Marx nor Engels really understood precapitalist societies, though the anthropological materials available to them had been pretty basic."
5198,和其他同代的马克思主义者一样，阿尔都塞对经典马克思主义仍然在宣称的各发展阶段的必然性提出了质疑因此他更深人地研究马克思并希望从中找到一个能够同时适用于阶级社会和无阶级社会的分析工具。,"Althusser, like other contemporary Marxists, doubted the inevitability of the stages that orthodox Marxism still claimed.He therefore tried to dig deeper into Marx to find an analytical tool applicable to both class and nonclass societies."
5198,他所找到的是生产方式（mode of production)这个概念。,What he came up with was the mode of production.
5199,马克思主义人类学所有概念里最重要的是“生产方式” （mode of production)，这个概念出自卡尔•马克思的《资本论》第一卷 (特别参见 Mane 1974 [ 1867]: 667 -724)。,"The most important of all concepts in Marxist anthropology is mode of production, based on Karl Marx’s ideas in Capital, Vol.i (see especially Marx 1974 [1867]: 667–724)."
5199,巴里•海因兹（Barry Hindess〉和保罗•赫斯特（Paul Hirst)对该词的用法作了经典注释 (Hindess and Hirst 1975: 9)。,The classic commentary on its usage is that by Barry Hindess and Paul Hirst (1975: 9).
5199,他们将生产方式定义为“由生产关系的支配构成的生产关系和生产力相连接的结合”。,They define a mode of production as ‘an articulated combination of relations and forces of production structured by the dominance of the relations of production’.
5200,民族志作者除了这些旨在树立其权威的技巧之外，还使用了别的手段 来直接构筑民族志呈现的有效性。,"Aside from the devices the ethnographer uses to constitute his authority, he uses others to establish the validity of his ethnographic presentations directly."
5200,我要列出卡特林、歌德和格尔茨在某种程度上使用过的其中三种技巧，他们藉此取得了大小不同的成功。,"I single out three of these, which are used to various extents and with variable success by Catlin, Goethe, and Geertz."
5200,生动叙述（hypotyposis)在卡特林文中占据了主导地位。,In Catlin it is a hypotyposis that predominates.
5200,歌德的技巧是外部的（不是隐喻的说法）戏剧性叙述（narrativity）。,In Goethe it is an external (nonmetaphorical) theatrical narrativity.
5200,格尔茨则主要依赖阐释技巧（interpretive virtuosity)。,Geertz depends primarily on interpretive virtuosity.
5200,在所有三个个案中，正如我们将要看到的，正是作者用来使其读者——以及他们自己——相信其描述的那些辞（figure）其实恰恰质疑了这些描述，而且在所有三个个案里而，一种制度性地合法化了的对“意义”的关注掩盖了取信的失败.,"In all three cases, as we shall see, the very figures the authors use to convince their readers—and themselves—of their descriptions in fact render them suspect, and in all three cases this failure to convince is covered by an institutionally legitimated concern for ""meaning."""
5201,随后，特纳认为，繁荣的生活圈存在于确立的结构之间。,
5201,,"Turner shows, then, a communitas that flourishes in the ""liminal"" interstices of society, outside and in between the established structures."
5201,格鲁克曼、道格拉斯和特纳全都肯定社区生活的力量，肯定小群体严密的组织、厚实的交织，维持一个强大的整体。,"Gluckman, Douglas, and Turner all affirm the strength of community life, how the tightly knit, thickly braided entanglements of the small group sustain a strong unity."
5201,因为人类所具有的可塑性、创造性和坏脾气，没有哪个纯粹“机械”的社会能够存在；但是社会人类学可以让我们了解，社会关系怎样以它们紧密连接、共同加强的方式发挥作用，维持社区的存在。,"No purely ""mechanical"" society can exist, for humans are too plastic, creative, and ornery; but social anthropology brings home to us how social relationships function in their interlocking, mutually reinforcing ways to sustain the community."
5202,"然而他们忽略了这样一个赤裸裸的事实：西方世界的生活水平是建立在对不可再生资源的巨大消耗率基础之上的；他世界总人足50%,但却消耗了这些资源中远远超出50%的部分。例如，到20世纪70年代,美国人——不足世界总人口的（大约）5%——消耗着全世界资源的 50%还要多。","Overlooked is the stark fact the standard of living in the Western world is based on a rate of consumption of nonrenewable resources whereby far less than 50% of the worlds population uses a good deal more than 50% of these resources.By the early 1970s, for example, the people of the United States—less than 5% (approximately) of the world’s population—were consuming more than 50% of all the world's resources."
5202,像这样的数据说明，期望世界上大多数民族在最近的将来都达到像西方世界那样的生活水平，是不现实的。,"Figures such as this suggest it is not realistic to expect most peoples of the world to achieve a standard of living comparable to that of the Western world in the near future, if at all."
5202,至少，西方世界的国家将不得不大大削减他们的资源消耗。,"At the very least, the countries of the Western world would have to cut drastically their consumption of resources."
5203,然而，我个人则倾向于联系“社会契约”的概念和人类天性、社会， 以及源自该概念的文化多样性等观念开始探讨人类学。,"My choice, though, would be with the concept of the ‘social contract’, and the perceptions of human nature, society, and cultural diversity which emerged from this concept."
5203,这就是我在 本书中的起点。,This is where I shall begin.
5203,另外一个原本无关的起点是生命巨链（Great Chain of Being)的观点，它将人类位置确定在神和动物之间。,"Another, essentially unrelated, beginning is the idea of the Great Chain of Being, which defined the place of the human species as between God and the animals."
5203,在某些方面这个观点是进化论思想的先驱，在本章中我们将会在相关场景中审视这一观点。,"This idea was in some respects a forerunner of the theory of evolution, and later in this chapter we shall look at it in that context."
5204,例如，反结构在线性状态中可以被找到，在这一状态中，当人们在生命礼仪中经过童年进人成年，新加人的人会暂停下来。,
5204,,"Anti-structure,forexample, is found in the ""liminal"" state in which initiates are suspended as they pass from childhood to adulthood in rites of passage."
5204,新加入的人既不是孩子也不是成人，而是位于这两个确立状态“之间”。,"Initiates are neither child nor adult, they are ""betwixt and between"" these established statuses."
5204,不过，在这一线性状态，新加入的人享受这种来自共有的苦难的团结和同伴关系。,"Yet in this ""liminal"" state, the initiates enjoy that unity and fellowship which comes from shared suffering."
5205,生态系统方法论在某些方面有助于淡化文化的概念。,
5205,正如艾伦（Ellen) (1982 :76)和莫兰（Moran) (1990:3)所述，在人类学领域，接受生态模式理论是反对把文化概念看作是有问题的一种反应。,
5205,文化决定论无法解释生态关系已是不言自明的事实，文化观念作为封闭系统的看法也已被贸易网络及其他各种跨越文化界线的事实所否认。,"The inability of cultural determinism to address ecological relations was becoming clear, and the image of cultures as closed systems was everywhere denied by evidence of trading networks and other forms of exchange which spanned the boundaries between cultures."
5205,生态系统模式为将人类社会的外部关系拓展为值得研究的领域提供了新的视角，同时也维持了强调生态学的传统，使其有别于民族生态学。,"The ecosystem model provided a way of reclaiming the external relations of human societies as a respectable field of study, and maintained an emphasis on ecology, as distinct from ethnoecology."
5206,关于自然，人类学有两种主要的观念：外部自然或曰生态系统，内部自然或称人类天性。,"Anthropology has two main kinds of concepts about nature: external nature, or the ecosystem, and inner nature, or human nature."
5206,这两种观念代表文化的相反面。,Both of these concepts represent the opposite of culture.
5206,有文化的东西总是区别于自然，而且文化总是意味着转变自然的东西，某些时候甚至是否定。,"What is cultural is always something other than nature, and culture always implies a transformation, and sometimes a denial, of that which is natural."
5206,列维-斯特劳斯的格言，所有的人类社会都区分文化和自然，被很多人类学家所接受（但是也被另外一些人类学家所质疑，参见Descola和Pálsson的相关著作，1996）。,"Lévi-Strauss's axiom that all human societies distinguish between culture and nature is accepted by many anthropologists (but challenged by others, see the contributions to Descola and Pálsson 1996)."
5206,有时，我们非人性化的环境显得像是对人类事业的一种主要威胁：它们似乎会破坏我们的庄稼，杀死我们的牲畜，等等。,"Our non-humanised surroundings may sometimes appear as a major threat to human projects: they may threaten to destroy our crops, kill our livestock and so on."
5206,每一个文化事业似乎都暗含着一种对外部自然和内部自然的同时转变。,Every cultural project seems to imply a transformation of both external and human nature.
5207,也许今天没有任何一位人类学家在写作时不把人与环境之间的关系描述为决定性的，要么是人类决定环境，要么是环境决定人类。,"Probably no anthropologist writing today would describe the relationship between human beings and their environments as deterministic, in either direction."
5207,但现在人们一改过去对环境因素塑造或被塑造的关注，开始从人与环境互惠的角度对文化理论进行改进，并以开放的姿态，关注人类与其生存环境的互动关系。,"Instead of either shaping or being shaped by environmental factors, human beings are understood to interact with their environments in mutually constitutive ways."
5207,有两种模式对文化理论具有重要的启发性：首先是生态系统模式，此模式在19世纪60年代以来一直在生态人类学领域占据着支配地位，其次是认知的概念，只是在近五年左右才由心理学引人人类学领域。,"Within this broad approach, two models in particular have important implications for cultural theory: first, the ecosystem model, which has been prominent in ecological anthropology since the late 1960s, and second, the concept of direct perception, which has entered anthropological thought from psychology only during the past five years or so."
5208,此外，人类学必须要成为非专门化的“跨学科的学科”，因为只有整体综合（也许似乎有些业余性）运用各种形态的信息才有望抓住处于文化建构和社会互动中的世界的“巨大的复杂性”（Bateson 1959: 296）。,"Furthermore, anthropology had to be a non-specialist, ‘interdisciplinary discipline’ because only in a holistic(however seemingly seeming amateurish) use of all manner ofinformation could it expect to tackle the ‘vast intricacies’ of the worlds of cultural construction and social interaction (Bateson 1959:296)."
5208,因此，人类学理解需要与人种学、生态学、生物学、哲学、美学以及心理分析联系起来。,"Hence the need for an anthropological understanding to connect up with ethnology, ecology, biology, philosophy, aesthetics and psychoanalysis."
5208,这将会带来新的生态世界观，美学和意识能在此合二为一的形成“神圣的”关于生活惟一性以及生活一元实体论的认识。,"This might then give onto a new ecological world-view where aesthetics and consciousness combined to form a ‘sacred’recognition of the one-ness of life, of life’s ontological monism."
5209,但是即使在工业社会的条件下，反全球论视角也不等同于近年来一些研究提出的激进环境决定论。,"But even within the context of industrial society, the antiglobalist perspective does not amount to what more recent analyses have identified as radical environmentalism."
5209,对于多布森（Dobson) (1990) 和厄科斯雷 （Ecker Sley)(1992) 而言， 更为激进的环境决定论（他们分别称其为“生态主义”和“生态中心主义”）认为环境具有一种不依赖于其对人类的有用性而存在的价值，要正确对待环境，人类就必须视自己为生态系统中的一个元素，而不是宇宙的中心。,"For both Dobson (1990) and Eckersley (1992), the more radical form of environmentalism (to which they refer, respectively, as ""ecologism"" and ""ecocentrism"") is based on the understanding that the environment has a value independent of its use to human beings and that our proper treatment of it requires us to see ourselves as just one element in an ecological system rather than as the centre of the universe."
5209,联系这种观点，则上述环境辩论中的两种视角都称不上是激进的，因为他们争论的是资源利用的模式，除了这种人与自然的关系之外其他的都不属于这场辩论的范畴。,"In relation to this view, neither perspective engaged in the debate analysed above can properly be seen as radical, for they are competing models of resource use.The debate is defined in terms which do not admit any other understanding of humanenvironment relations."
5210,本书所收的文章并不代表一个内在一致的“人类学”(Wolf 1980)内部的一种趋向或视角。,"The present essays do not represent a tendency or perspective within a coherent ""anthropology"" (pace Wolf 1980)."
5210,旧有的人类学定义包括学科“四领域”：体质（或生物”人类学，考古学，文化(或社会）人类学和语言学，对此博厄斯可能是最后一个鉴赏者了。,"The ""four-field"" definition of the discipline, of which Boas was perhaps the last virtuoso, included physical (or biological) anthropology, archaeology, cultural (or social) anthropology, and linguistics."
5210,今天很少有人能够严肃地说这些领域共享统一的方法或研究对象，尽管主要因为制度安排，这一梦想还在持续。,"Few today can seriously claim that these fields share a unified approach or object, though the dream persists, thanks largely to institutional arrangements."
5210,本书的文章占据了一片新天地，这是作为整个学科的终极目标的“人”的瓦解所开放出来的。它们吸收了文本批评、文化史学、符号学、哲学阐释学和心理分析领域的最近发展成果。,"The essays in this volume occupy a new space opened up by the disintegration of ""Man"" as telos for a whole discipline, and they draw on recent developments in the fields of textual criticism, cultural history, semiotics, hermeneutic philosophy, and psychoanalysis."
5211,人类学越来越有兴趣去纠正那些被高度的功能主义和结构主义拋弃或剔除的事物，相应调整他们的唯物主义加理性主义的世界观。,"There is an increasing interest within anthropology to rectify the deletions and excesses of high functionalism and structuralism, along with their materialist-cum-rationalist world-view."
5211,这种趋向强调理解文化表述的高度重要性，包括当地人眼中的神话。,"The trend is to stress the foremost importance of understanding cultural expression, including the mythic, from indigenous points of view."
5211,就像马凌诺夫斯基（Malinowski 1926: 18)观察到的那样，参与到神话诗学中的人相信“神话是活生生的现实”。,"As Malinowski observed (1926:18), for people who engage with mythopoetics, myth is ""reality lived""."
5211,许多人类学家如今希望去理解神话在日常生活中的运用，它们作为消遣、教育、治疗和阐释的表述价值，以及作为知识和丰富诗歌的明证（Brady 1991a；Turner and Bruner 1986)。,"Many anthropologists now wish to understand the context of the use of myths in everyday life, their performative value as entertainment, as pedagogy, cure and explanation—and as evidence of knowledge and a rich poetics (cf. Brady 1991a; Turner and Bruner 1986)."
5212,把易洛魁人和欧洲人作一番比较同样是有教益的。,A comparison between the Iroquois and Europeans is also instructive.
5212,在16世纪的某个时期（如果不是更早的话），五个易洛魁民族——莫霍克人、奥奈达人、奥农多加人、卡尤加人和塞尼卡人——决定用一个简单的办法来结束他们之间的战争，即把他们的掠夺活动指向外人，而非相互掠夺。,"Sometime in the 16th century, five Iroquoian nations—the Mohawks, Oneidas, Onondagas, Cayugas, and Senecas—determined to end warfare among themselves by the simple device of directing their predatory activities against outsiders, rather than each other."
5212,因此著名的易洛魁邦联诞生了。,In this way the famous League of the Iroquois came into being.
5212,类似地，1095年罗马教皇乌尔班二世在发动十字军东征的时候，用这样的演讲鼓动欧洲的基督教贵族们：要结束他们相互之间无休止的战争，一致对外，将敌意转向信奉伊斯兰教的土耳其人和阿拉伯人。,"Similarly, in the year 1095, Pope Urban II launched the Crusades with a speech urging European barons to end their ceaseless wars against each other by directing their hostilities outward against the Turks and Arabs."
5213,在一个以连续性而非以变迁为主题的段落里，勒华拉杜里把过去和现在都空间化了。,"In a passage that thematizes continuity more than change, Le Roy Ladurie spatializes the then and the now."
5213,他在弯曲的街上看到了连续性，更特别的是，他在海拔高度和气候上也看到了连续性。,"He sees continuity in a curving street and, more peculiarly, in the altitude and the climate."
5213,自从14世纪初以来，这个村子的海拔和天气可能已经发生了很大的变化吗？,Could the village's elevation and weather have changed much since the early fourteenth century?
5213,但是，就是这种长时段连续性的意识诱导这位历史学家去犯他的学科的重罪：时间错误anachmnism)。,Yet this very sense of long-term continuity tempts the historian into committing his discipline's cardinal sin: anachronism.
5214,在1970年代的各项进展中，我们可以发现一条不断扩大的裂痕：一方是唯物主义、马克思主义和政治经济学的观点。另一方是唯心主义、象征主义和解释学的观点。,"In the developments of the 1970s one can see a widening breach: between the perspectives of materialism, Marxism, and political economy, on the one hand, and those of idealism, symbolism, and interpretivism, on the other."
5214,尽管如此，仍然存在着弥补这种裂痕的尝试。,"However, there were also efforts to bridge this divide."
5214,谢里˙奥特纳在术语“实践理论”（practice theory)的名义下进行的许多这样的努力都以失败而告终（Ortner 1984)。,Sherry Ortner collapsed a number of such efforts under the term practice theory (1984).
5214,“实践理论”并不是一个单一的范式，而是一个结合了行动者导向和结构导向理论的概念——随着安东尼˙吉登斯著作的问世，能动性 (agency)和结构（structure)成为人们青睐的术语。,This was not a single paradigm but a concept that brought together actor-oriented and structure-oriented theories—agency and structure became the preferred terms once Anthony Giddens's work was known.
5215,人类学，实际上既是推理的也是归的（因为它既受理论和研究者其他心理构建的引导，也受被研究的事实的引导），既是内省的也是外省的（因为理解他者也包括理解自身），同时还是实验的（因为一个人是积极主动地参与社会生活而不是被动地记录数据）。,"Anthropology is, in fact, deductive as well as inductive (because it is guided by theory and other mental constructions of the researcher as well as based on facts researched), introspective as well as extrospective (because understanding of the other entails understanding of the self), and experimental (because one is actively participating in social life rather than passively recording data)."
5215,田野工作是“反身性的”。,"Fieldwork is ""reflexive""."
5215,尽管它包含所有这些元素——推理、内省和实验——人类学还是与像哲学、心理学这样的学科有着明确的区分，后两个学科主要强调它们自己。,"Despite its containing all these elements – deduction, introspection, and experimentation – anthropology is distinct from such disciplines as philosophy and psychology, which emphasize them."
5215,人类学独特的重点依然是以田野工作为基础去理解人类的体验。,Anthropology's distinctive emphasis remains understanding of human experience based on fieldwork.
5216,战后对殖民主义的批评——削弱了“西方”再现其他社会的能力——为理论化再现自身的局限之重要过程所强化。,"The critique of colonialism in the postwar period — an undermining of ""The West's"" ability to represent other societies—has been reinforced by an important process of theorizing about the limits of representation itself."
5216,我们没办法充分调査对维柯(Vico)称之为文化史的“严肃诗歌”的各种各样的批评。,"There is no way adequately to survey this multifarious critique of what Vico called the ""serious poem"" of cultural history."
5216,立场层出不穷：“阐释学”、“结构中义”、“心态史”、“新马克思主义”、“谱系学”、“后结构主义”、“后现代主义”、“实用主义”，还有大量“替代性认识论”——女性主义的、民族的、非西方的。,"Positions proliferate: ""hermeneutics,"" ""structuralism,"" ""history of mentalities,"" ""neo-Marxism,"" ""genealogy,"" ""post-structuralism,"" ""post-modernism,"" ""pragmatism""; also a spate of ""alternate epistemologies"" — feminist, ethnic, and non-Western."
5216,至关重要但并非总是得到承认的一环，是正在进行的对西方最自信、最有特色的话语的批评。,"What is at stake, but not always recognized, is an ongoing critique of the West's most confident, characteristic discourses."
5217,1970年代中期，这种立足实践而对实证主义的高理论的攻击其本身也是在一种抽象的理论讨论样式中进行的，既脱离于也指向各种实践体裁。,"During the mid-1970s, this practice-focused attack on positivist high theory was itself conducted within the genre of abstract theoretical discussion, separate from, and pointing to, genres of practice."
5217,到1980年代，这种批评进入到悬置范式权威的阶段，同时也质疑体系构建的效用。它赞成在对社会生括作特定记述处理方面进行自由操作和实验，在高理论方面对实证主义的挑战重点开始转为在本质更加民族志化和更具实验性，其中一个杰出的例子就是理査德˙J˙伯恩斯坦（Richard J. Bernstein）正在开展的工作。,"By the 1980s, this critique has moved to a suspension of paradigmatic authority and a questioning of the utility of system building in favor of free play and experimentation in the specific rendering of accounts of social life.A perfect example of the shift in emphasis toward the more substantively ethnographic and experimental among the ""high"" theory treatments of the challenge to positivism is the evolving work of Richard J. Bernstein."
5218,列维-斯特劳斯在《忧郁的热带》（1961）中“一小杯朗姆酒”那章，谈到两种遏制他者的危险的办法之间的对立，食人肉和吐人肉（Bauman 1995: 179-80）。,"Lévi-Strauss, in the chapter entitled ‘A Little Glass of Rum’ in Tristes Tropiques (1961), discusses the contrast between two solutions for neutralizing the dangers of the other, the anthropophagic versus the anthropoemic strategy (cf. Bauman 1995:179–80)."
5218,他指出，首先食人肉无疑会引起西方人最强烈的恐惧与厌恶。,
5218,,"He notes that the first, the strategy of cannibalism, is repellent to Western sensibilities as the most barbaric of all customs."
5218,可是在亚马逊的土著中存在一种普遍观念，即要增强自身的力量就只能消化掉危险的他者的力量（Overing Kaplan 1981）。,"It is, however, a widely spread notion of native Amazonia that the powers of the self acquire their human potency only by assimilating the powers of dangerous others (Overing Kaplan 1981)."
5219,为了与这个模型相一致，列维-斯特劳斯认为很可能是这样：同族相食（endocannibals）（他们吃死去的亲戚的部分身体）会煮熟了吃，而异族相食（exocannibals）（他们吃敌人的身体）会烤着吃。,"In accordance with this model, Lévi-Strauss held that it was likely that endocannibals (who eat parts of deceased relatives) would boil them, while exocannibals (who eat enemies) would roast them."
5219,为了验证这个“假说”，哈佛大学的人类学家保罗·尚克曼（Paul Shankman）处理了60个被认为是食人族社会的资料，他发现，有17个是煮着吃的，而有20个是烤着吃的，还有6个是既煮着吃又烤着吃，其余的使用了其他食用技术，包括烘焙。,"In a bid to test the 'hypothesis', the Harvard anthropologist Paul Shankman processed data from sixty societies assumed to practise cannibalism.He found that seventeen boiled while twenty roasted; six did both.The rest used other techniques for preparation, including baking."
5219,而且，尚克曼发现，在食用对象的分类和备办的方法之间没有相关性（Harris 1979）。,"Shankman found, further, that there was no correlation between the categorisation of the eaten and the mode of preparation(Harris 1979)."
5220,当早期原人的某些种群开始制造他们可用来屠宰动物以得到肉食的石制工具时，人类的文化看来就已经发展起来了。,Human culture appears to have developed as some populations of early hominines began making stone tools they could butcher animals with for their meat.
5220,最早的石制工具和值得注意的食肉证据，与人类出现一起，可追溯到约250万年前，人脑显著地扩大，超过任何其他早期原人的脑。,"Actually, the earliest stone tools and evidence of significant meat eating date to between 2.5 million and 2 million years ago, along with the appearance of the genus Homo, whose brain was significantly enlarged over that of any other early hominine."
5220,从那时起，习得的行为——文化——在人的持续生存中越来越重要，有助于更好的人脑的演化，反过来，更好的人脑使作为手段的文化改进成为可能，人类借助文化手段保证他们的持续生存。,"From then on the increasing importance of culture in human survival favored the evolution of a better brain, which in turn made possible improvement in culture as the vehicle humans used to secure their survival."
5220,在40万年前到20万年前之间，人脑的脑量达到现代人脑的大小，而文化则一直到现在还在不断地演化和变化。,
5221,寻食是最古老、最普遍类型的人类调适。,Food foraging is the oldest and most universal type of human adaptation.
5221,我们应把社会组织的重要要素归功于性別分工、食物分享，以及作为日常活动中心的大本营，而且在那里实现食物的分享。,"To it we owe such important elements of social organization as the sexual division of labor, food sharing, and a home base as the center of daily activity and where food sharing is accomplished."
5221,完全不同的调适，包括农业和畜牧业，在世界某些地区在9000—11000年前开始发展起来。,"Quite different adaptations, involving farming and animal husbandry, began to develop in some parts of the world between 9,000 and 11,000 years ago."
5221,借助于简单的手工工具种植家用植物的园艺，使比较永久的定居以及分工的重组成为可能在畜牧条件下，依靠放牧的家畜群，游牧生活得以持续，但是与其他民族互动的新模式发展起来了。,"Horticulture—the cultivation of domestic plants with simple hand tools—made possible more permanent settlements and a reorganization of the division of labor Under pastoralism—reliance on raising herds of domestic animalsnomadism continued, but new modes of interaction with other peoples were developed."
5222,传奇可能含有神话情节——特别是当它们诉诸超自然力量的时候——因此一直没有与神话截然分开。,"Legends may incorporate mythological details, especially when they make an appeal to the supernatural, and are therefore not always clearly distinct from myth."
5222,尼扬加民族的姆文多史诗仿效姆文多穿越大地、大气层、阴间和遥远的天空，为尼扬加民族关于他们世界的组织和界线的观点画了一幅全景图。,"The Mwindo epic of the Nyanga people follows him through the earth, the atmosphere, the underworld, and the remote sky and gives a complete picture of the Nyanga people's view of their world's organization and limits."
5222,传奇可能还包含谚语和附带的传说，因而可能与其他口头艺术形式相联系。,Legends also may incorporate proverbs and incidental tales and thus may be related to other forms of verbal art as well.
5222,例如，门德人的坎姆比利史诗据说包含多达150条谚语。,"A recitation of the Kambili epic of the Mande, for example, has been said to include as many as 150 proverbs."
5223,在位于人口不太稠密的新几内亚高地边缘的社会中，恩加人的次级氏族是接近于最大规模合伙亲属群体的单位，如甄巴加人那样（参见第六章）。,"The Enga subclan is a unit approximately the size of the largest corporate kin groups in societies occupying the less densely populated highland fringe of New Guinea, such as theTsembaga [see Chapter 6]."
5223,"但是，恩加人组织为更高一级的群体（也以父系继嗣为基础），即氏族。每个氏族平均约有350个成员，他们是氏族领土的最终拥有者和捍卫者,所有氏族成员最终从氏族那里获得其生计。","But the Enga are organized into a still higher level grouping （also based on patrilineal descent）, the clan, which averages about 350 members and is the ultimate owner and defender of the territory of the dart, from which all clan members ultimately derive their subsistence."
5223,氏族自身小心谨慎地界定领土并在战斗中以及在庆典场合中桿卫它们。,Clans own carefully defined territories and defend them both in battle and on ceremonial occasions.
5223,头人领导他们，在氏族之间的关系方面为氏族代言，并在氏族内部工作，动员独立的家庭进行军事、政治和庆典的活动。,"They are led by Big Men who speak for their clans in interclan relations and who work within their clans to mobilize the separate households for military, political, and ceremonial action."
5224,最年幼的和最年长的有权不参加劳动，女人主要负责农活，只有男人外出打猎。村子的首领和巫师是村子里的最高权威。,"The youngest and the oldest are entitled not to work, while the women are mainly responsible for agricultural activities, and only the men go hunting.The village headman and the shaman are the highest authorities in the villages."
5224,这些职务都不是世袭的；他们要通过出色的人品和与他人对权力的角逐才能获得。,Neither of these offices is hereditary; they are achieved through outstanding personal qualities and through successfully competing for power with others.
5224,因为劳动分工非常简单，也许每个家户各管各的事情有好处。,"Since the division of labour is rather simple, it might be thought an advantage for each household to run its own business independently."
5224,但是，让雅诺马马人大规模地团结在一起有更加充分的理由。,"However, there are sound reasons for the Yanomamö to stick together in larger groups."
5224,首先，有必须集体完成的任务，比如狩猎和典礼。,"First, there are necessary tasks which have to be done collectively, such as hunting and rituals."
5224,其次，雅诺马马人定期地卷入与邻村人的世仇中，很自然，当他们经常面对这种情形时，人数众多既更加有力量也会更加安全。,"Second, the Yanomamö are periodically involved in feuds with their neighbours, and naturally there is both strength and security in numbers when they are regularly faced with this kind of situation."
5225,夏威夷亲属称谓制（Hawaiian system)，在夏威夷和其他说马来一波利尼西业语的地区很普遍，但同时也能在其他地方发现。它是最简单的亲属称谓制，因为它使用的称呼最少。,"The Hawaiian system of kinship terminology, common (as its name implies) in Hawaii and other Malayo-Polynesian-speaking areas but found elsewhere as well, is the least complex system, in that it uses the fewest terms."
5225,夏威夷制又称世代制，因为同代同性别的亲属都用同一称呼指称（参见图10.6）。,"The Hawaiian system is also called the generational system, since all relatives of the same generation and sex are referred to by the same term (Figure 10.6)."
5225,例如，在某人父母那一辈里，用来称呼其父亲的那个词也被用来称呼其父亲的兄弟和其母亲的兄弟。,"For example, in one's parents' generation, the term used to refer to one's father is used as well for the father^ brother and mother's brother."
5225,相似地，某人的母亲、母亲的姐妹，以及某人父亲的姐妹也都被归于同一个称呼之下。,"Similarly, one's mother, her sister, and one's father's sister are all lumped under a single term."
5226,寻食民族与食物生产民族之间另外一个不同点是世界观（worldviews）的不同。,Another difference between food-gathering and food-producing populations lies in their different worldviews.
5226,一般而言，寻食者倾向于把他们自己看成是自然界的一部分，并与之保持某种平衡关系。,"As a general rule, food foragers tend to conceive of themselves as a part of the natural world and in some sort of balance with it."
5226,这一点反映在他们对所杀动物的态度上。,This is reflected in their attitudes toward the animals they kill.
5226,例如，西部的阿贝那基人的猎手认为，动物和人一样是由肉体和灵魂组成的。,"Western Abenaki hunters, for example, thought animals, like humans, were composed of both a body and a personal spirit."
5226,虽然阿贝那基人猎杀动物来维持他们自己的生存，但他们明显意识到，动物应得到适当的尊重,"Although Abenakis hunted and killed animals to sustain their own lives, they clearly recognized that animals were entitled to proper respect."
5227,人类学不再带着启动的权威替那些被界定为不能为自己说话的人(“原始的”“前文字的'“无历史的”）说话。,"Anthropology no longer speaks with automatic authority for others defined as unable to speak for themselves (""primitive,"" ""pre-literate,"" ""without history"")."
5227,其他人群不再那么容易被抛入特殊的、几乎总是过去或正在过去的时代——把他们表现得仿佛他们没被包含在当下的世界体系之中，而正是这些世界体系把民族志学者和他们所研究的人民一道牵连其中。,"Other groups can less easily be distanced in special, almost always past or passing, times—represented as if they were not involved in the present world systems that implicate ethnographers along with the peoples they study."
5227,“文化”并非为了他们的描绘而静止不动，试图使文化保持静态，必然包含了简化和排除，选择暂时的焦点，建构特定的自我-他者关系，以及一种权力关系的强加或讨价还价。,"""Cultures"" do not hold still for their portraits.Attempts to make them do so always involve simplification and exclusion, selection of a temporal focus, the construction of a particular self-other relationship, and the imposition or negotiation of a power relationship."
5228,如果说对民族主义的彻底贬低是一个陷阱，那么另一个相关的陷阱也许就是对世界主义的绝对髙估。这是另一个问题。,"If one pitfall lies in the absolute devaluation of nationalism, another related pitfall may lie in the absolute overvaluation of cosmopolitanism."
5228,我们不能认为世界主义已经超越了民族主义的混乱，尽管有人这么认为。,"This is the beginning of another story, but we cannot assume that cosmopolitanism – however conceived – is free from the equivocations which unsettle nationalism."
5228,世界主义不是神药，它也不能超越现实政治世界的矛盾。,Cosmopolitanism is not a miraculous physic and cannot be above the contradictions of our political world
5229,一个引人注意的现象是，“神话”作为一个词汇进入英语辞典是相当晚近的事，大约在19世纪早期才开始出现（Williams 1983a [1976])。,"It is significant that ""myth"" as a word came late into the English lexicon, appearing only in the early nineteenth century (Williams 1983a [1976])."
5229,它带着从古希腊理性主义者那里继承的传统进入语言体系，而且对理性和非理性进行辩论的目的是为了发现真理。,"Its entry into the language carried with it the tradition inherited from the rationalist intellectuals of Classical Greece, and their debate on the rational and the irrational in their endeavours to discover truth."
5229,这一词汇在欧洲 逐渐普及的过程，很大程度上与世俗化的进程有关，特别是科学在与教会和其他力量的斗争中通过宣称掌握现实的真理从而取得支配地位。,"The growth of the popularity of the word in the European context is most likely associated with the process of secularization, and especially the battle of the sciences for ascendancy over the church and other powers in their ""truth-claims"" about reality."
5230,这位国王决意在原型民族主义（protonationalist）这一最基本的君权统治以及封建主义政治经济结构的背后动员有组织的并且合法的力量来制约教会的势力，尽管法令本身矛盾重重，但是其原则就是要反对天主教会所主张的国际主义（internationalism)、教义的普及和学习以及任何潜在的社会流动性。天主教会的这些主张是克吕尼改革的集中体现，其目的在于应对世俗权威应凌驾于教会之上的观点（Caesaropapalism)的挑战。,"They represent Henry's most determined attempt to mobilize the sanctions of organized and legitimate force behind the protonationalist monarchy and behind the politicoeconomic structures of feudalism, which with all their internal contradictions represent a principle opposed to the internationalism,learning, and potential social mobility then represented by the Catholic church, in the fine fleur of the Cluniac reform and before the emergent arrogance of Caesaropapalism."
5230,贝克特没有同主教们协商就对亨利的要求妥协和迁就，这令他们十分失望和不满。,"Becket dismayed the other bishops by giving way, without consulting them, to Henry's demands."
5231,人们对被统称为世系理论的东西出现了一种不安，这是在逻辑和抽象意义上呈现的结构与现实状况之间经常出现的差异所导致的结果。,A certain unease with what can broadly be called lineage theory emerged as a result of the gap that often appeared between the structures as they were logically and abstractly presented and what seemed to be the facts on the ground.
5231,埃文思-普里查德自己记录了努尔人中存在于他所描述的想象中的共同世系群体（1951)与实际存在的居民社区之间的不一致。,Evans-Pritchard himself had documented the disparity among the Nuer between the supposedly corporate lineage groups he described (1951) and the residential communities that existed in actuality.
5231,在每一个村庄和领地内，相当多的村民原来都不是根据“主导”氏族的祖先来追溯血统的；这些村民也许是母系亲属、姻亲或只是依附者。,"In every village and territory a significant number of villagers turned out not to trace descent from the ancestor of the ""dominant"" clan; these villagers might be matrilateral kin, affines, or mere hangers-on."
5231,为了解答这一问题，埃文思-普里查德声称，对于努尔人来说，分支的系谱提供了地域分支的概念模型，因此出现的差异其实是无关紧要的。,"Evans-Pritchard resolved the question by claiming that, for the Nuer, the segmentary genealogy provided the conceptual model of territorial segmentation, and so the disparity was made moot."
5232,如西南亚的早期城市一样，阿兹特克人社会的基础是集约农业。,"As in the early cities of southwest Asia, the foundation of Aztec society was intensive agriculture."
5232,玉米是主要的作物，每个家庭由其世系群分配一份土地，种植各种各样的作物，包括大豆、南瓜、葫芦、胡椒、西红柿、棉花和烟草。,"Com was the principal crop.Each family, allotted a plot of land by its lineage, cultivated any of a number of crops, including beans, squash, gourds, peppers, tomatoes, cotton, and tobacco."
5232,然而，与旧世界的社会不同，只有几种动物是驯养的；这些动物包括狗和火鸡（都是供食用的）。,"Unlike Old World societies, however, only a few animals were domesticated; these included dogs and turkeys (both for eating)."
5232,许多（但不是全部）庄稼种在特诺奇蒂特兰城周围的小块土地上，该城是在四周环湖的浅水中由人工建造的。,Many of the crops were grown in around Tenochtitlan in plots actually constructed artificially in the shallow waters of the surrounding lake.
5232,在园圃或突起的田地之间的水道，不仅便于运输，而且也是用作堆肥的水生植物的来源。,Canals between these chinampas not only facilitated transport but were also a source of water plants used for heavy mulching.
5233,非工业社会的人们通过互惠、再分配和市场交换过程来交换物品。,"Nonindustrial peoples exchange goods through the processes of reciprocity, redistribution, and market exchange."
5233,互惠包括大致相等价值的物品和服务的交换，而且它往往是为仪式目的或为获得尊重而进行的。,"Reciprocity involves the exchange of goods and services of roughly equivalent value, and it is often undertaken for ritual purposes or in order to gain prestige."
5233,再分配需要某种政府和(或)宗教精英，以物品或以服务的形式去搜集资源，然后，把它们再分配出去。,Redistribution requires some sort of government and/or religious elite to collect and then reallocate resources in the form of either goods or services.
5233,在非工业社会中，市场交换意指到专门的地点直接交换物品，它也起消遣作用，并作为交换重要信息的手段起作用。后者往往是促使人们到集市去的主要驱动力。,"Market exchange, which in nonindustrial societies means going to a specific place for direct exchange of goods, also serves as entertainment and as a way to exchange important information.The latter two are frequently primary motivating forces bringing people into the marketplace."
5234,北美人类学家利奧波德•波西皮西尔1955年对新几内亚西部的山民巴布亚卡保库人的研究，可以说明文化在经济、政治和社会方面的整合。,"The integration of the economic, political, and social aspects of a culture can be illustrated by the Kapauku Papuans, a mountain people of western New Guinea studied in 1955 by North American anthropologist Leopold Pospisil."
5234,卡保库人的经济依赖植物耕作，以及养猪、狩猎和捕鱼。,"The Kapauku economy relies on plant cultivation, along with pig breeding, hunting, and fishing."
5234,尽管植物耕作提供了人们大部分的食物，但是，男子只有通过养猪才能获得政治权力和合法权威的地位。,"Although plant cultivation provides most of the peopled food, men achieve political power and positions of legal authority through pig breeding."
5234,在卡保库人那里，养猪是复杂的事务。,"Among the Kapauku, pig breeding is a complex business."
5234,饲养许多头猪显然需要许多食物。,"Raising lots of pigs, obviously, requires a lot of food to feed them."
5235,尽管继嗣群体在许多社会都很重要，但并非在所有社会都能发现继嗣群体，它们也不是所能发现的扩大亲属群体的唯一种类。,"Important though descent groups are in many societies, they are not found in all societies nor are they the only kinds of nonfamilial kinship groups found."
5235,"双边亲属关系（有时被错误地称为双边继嗣）是西方社会的一个特点，也是很多食物采集社会的一个特点。它通过男女两性把一个人与其他近“血缘""亲戚（而非姻亲）联系起来，换句话说，个体是通过他的父母双方、所有的袓父母外袓父母四人等等来追溯他的系，并承认其多个祖先。","Bilateral descent, a characteristic of Western society as well as a number of food-foraging societies, affiliates a person with close relatives through both sexes; in other words, the individual traces descent through both parents, all four grandparents, and so forth, recognizing multiple ancestors."
5236,"在双重继嗣（double descent）,或者叫双重单边继嗣中，继嗣是同时依父系和母系两边计算的，这是一种非常罕见的继嗣。","Double descent, or double unilineal descent, whereby descent is reckoned both patrilineally and matrilineally at the same time, is very rare."
5236,在这种继嗣体系中，为了某些目的，继嗣是母系的，而为了另一些目的，继嗣又是父系的。,In this system descent is matrilineal for some purposes and patrilineal for others.
5236,一般而言，在采取这种继嗣方式的地方，母系群体和父系群体在社会的不同领域发挥作用。,"Generally, where double descent is reckoned, the matrilineal and patrilineal groups take action in different spheres of society."
5236,例如，在尼日利亚东部的亚科（Yako）人中，财产被分成父系的财产和母系的财产。,"For example, among the Yako of eastern Nigeria, property is divided into both patrilineal line possessions and matrilineal line possessions."
5236,父系拥有永久性的生产资源，比如土地；而母系则拥有消耗性的财产，比如牲口。,"The patrilineage owns perpetual productive resources, such as land, whereas the matrilineage owns consumable property, such as livestock."
5237,在思考如何阅读、分析、阐释当代的这些自传文本的时候，我想到族群归属的追寻反映了双重焦点，而这一直是人类学基本原理的部分：在我们自己的背景中观看他人，在他人的背景中观看我们自己。,"In thinking about how to read, analyze, and interpret these contemporary autobiographical texts, it occurred to me that the ethnic search is a mirror of the bifocality that has always been part of the anthropological rationale: seei n g others against a background of ourselves, and ourselves against a background of others."
5237,将外人奇异的习俗与我们熟悉的习俗并置，或者相对化我们想当然的预设，一直是人类学所许诺的文化批评。,"The juxtaposing of exotic customs to familiar ones, or the relativizing of taken-for-granted assumptions, has always been the kind of cultural criticism promised by anthropology."
5237,在一个各社会之间越来越相互依赖的世界，这种双重焦点，或者说交互视角，也变得越来越重要：所描述的文化中的成员日益成为民族志的批判性读者。,"This bifocality, or reciprocity of perspectives, has become increasingly important in a world of growing interdependence between societies: members of cultures described are increasingly critical readers of ethnography."
5238,"举例来说,16世纪阿兹特克人以人为祭品供仪式之用的习俗。","Take, for example, the 16th-century Aztec practice of sacrificing humans for ritual purposes."
5238,北美人今天很少——如果有的话——会宽恕这种做法，但是通过中止判断，人们就能洞悉表面现象以下的东西，并理解它怎么起作用使老百姓相信：阿兹特克人的国家兴旺发达，太阳仍将普照大地。,"Few (if any) North Americans today would condone such practices, but by suspending judgment one can get beneath the surface and understand how it functioned to reassure the populace that the Aztec state was healthy and that the sun would remain in the heavens."
5238,除此之外，人们可以用同样的方式理解今天死刑在美国的作用。,"Beyond this, one can understand how the death penalty functions in the same way in the United States today."
5238,不同社会科学家的许多研究已明确证明死刑并没有威慑住暴力犯罪，一点也不亚于阿兹特克人实际上为太阳提供食物的献祭。,"Numerous studies by a variety of social scientists have shown clearly that the death penalty does not deter violent crime, any more than Aztec sacrifice really provided sustenance for the sun."
5239,就在第二次世界大战以前的数年中，在东欧犹太人年轻一代移民后代中发展出一种令人关注的两可系继嗣群体的变体。,"In the years just prior to World War II, an interesting variant of the ambilineal descent group developed among younger-generation descendants of east European Jewish immigrants."
5239,由于受美国文化较多的同化，他们中的一些人努力便他们自己与老一代成员区别开来，他们认为后者有些过时了。,"Being more assimilated into North American culture, some of them sought to separate themselves somewhat from members of older generations, who were perceived as a bit old-fashioned."
5239,然而，他们却仍然希望维持犹太人家族团结的传统伦理。,Yet they still wished to maintain the traditional Jewish ethic of family solidarity.
5239,因此他们成立了堂表兄弟姐妹俱乐部，这种倶乐部由一群有着共同祖先的第一代堂表兄弟姐妹及其配偶和子女组成。,"The result was the cousins club, which consists of a group of first cousins who share a common ancestry, their spouses, and their descendants."
5239,他们的父母、袓父、外袓父母因其陈旧观念和生活方式都被排除在外。,"Excluded are parents and grandparents of the cousins, with their older views and lifestyles."
5240,特殊化和概化是两个极端——它们是在与其他社会科学、人文学科和自然科学相比较时人类学所具有的双重特点。,"Particularizing and generalizing at the extremes – these are the dual features of anthropology when compared to the other social sciences, humanities, and the natural sciences."
5240,在一个极端，田野工作导致参与一个特定的群体，了解关于那一群体的知识。,"At one extreme, fieldwork leads to involvement with a particular group and to learning about that group."
5240,民族志学者与那一群体产生共鸣/身份认同，那一群体变成“我的村庄”、“我的部落”或“我的人民”。,"The ethnographer identifies with that group, which becomes ""my village"", ""my tribe"", or ""my people""."
5240,然后他成为一名臭名远扬的反对者。,He then becomes a notorious nay-sayer.
5241,收集在本书中的论文断言，上述意识形态已经溃败。,The essays collected here assert that this ideology has crumbled.
5241,这些文章认为文化是由相互激烈竞争的符码和表象构成，假设诗学和政治是不可分的，而科学位于历史和语言学过程之中，而不是之上，它们还假定，学术体裁和文学体裁相互渗透，描述文化的写作真正是试验性和伦理性的。,"They see culture as composed of seriously contested codes and representations; they assume that the poetic and the political are inseparable, that science is in, not above, historical and linguistic processes.They assume that academic and literary genres interpenetrate and that the writing of cultural descriptions is properly experimental and ethical."
5241,它们把焦点放在文本生产和修辞上，以便突出文化叙述的建构和人为的性质。,"Their focus on text making and rhetoric serves to highlight the constructed, artificial nature of cultural accounts."
5241,"这种做法削弱了过度透明的权威模式，把注意力引向民族志的历史困境，亦即，民族志总是陷入发明文化而非再现文化的境地（Wagner 1975),","It undermines overly transparent modes of authority, and it draws attention to the historical predicament of ethnography, the fact that it is always caught up in the invention, not the representation, of cultures (Wagner 1975)."
5242,人们对“生态系统”提出了不同的定义。,"Various definitions of ""ecosystem"" have been proposed."
5242,"其中一些定义强调其“有界的""（bounded)性质：“在生物圈某些特定的区域之内，整个有生命物质和无生命物质之间密切相关，并且进行着物质能量的交换”（Rappaport 1971:238)。","Some of these stress their bounded nature: ""the total of living organisms and non-living substances bound together in material exchanges within some demarcated portion of the biosphere"" (Rappaport 1971:238)."
5242,另一些定义关注于物质成分间转换的性质：“生物与非生物之间一系列动态的联系促进了能量的相互转，致使物质得以流通”(Hardesty 1977:14)。,"Others focus on the nature of the exchanges among components: ""a dynamic set of relationships between living and non-living things through which energy flows and materials cycle"" (Hardesty 1977:14)."
5242,对生态系统的研究倾向于关注生态系统内部的运作，特别是“体内平衡”（homeostasis)的过程，同时也关注参与交换的有生命物质与无生命物质之间，通过物质及其能量的转换来维持其自身的稳定性（见Ellen 1982:74)。,
5243,“体现”（embodiment)甚至超越了它的性别方面，是一个越来越引人关注的领域。,"‘Embodiment’, even beyond its gender aspects, is an area of increasing interest."
5243,特别是托马斯•朝达斯（Thomas Csordas)在梅洛-庞蒂（Merleau-Ponty，1962)的理论基础上提出的体现是不确定的（CSordasl990;参见CSordas 1994)。,"In particular, Thomas Csordas (1990; cf. 1994) has built on Merleau-Ponty’s (1962) notion that embodiment is indeterminate."
5243,他的观点比20世纪70年代出现的“身体人类学”的观点激进得多。,His view is much more radical than the notion of the ‘anthropology of the body’ which emerged in the 1970s.
5243,身体要大于各部分的总和。,The body is more than the sum of its parts.
5244,在传统上，人类学被划分为四个领域：体质人类学和三个文化人类学分支学科:考古学、语言人类学和民族学。,"Anthropology is traditionally divided into four fields: physical anthropology and the three branches of cultural anthropology, which are archaeology, linguistic anthropology, and ethnology."
5244,"体质人类学（Physical Anthropology)主要研究作为生物有机体的人,而文化人类学（Cultural Anthropology）研究作为文化造者的人类。当然，二者是相互联系的。我们若不知道人类是如何创生的，我们就不能理解人是如何思考和行动的。","Physical anthropology is concerned primarily with humans as biological organisms, while cultural anthropology deals with humans as cultural animals.Both, of course, are closely related; we cannot understand what people do unless we know what people are."
5244,我们想要了解生物特性焉如何影响文化，文化又是如何影响生物特性的。,"And we want to know how biology does and does not influence culture, as well as how culture affects biology."
5245,话语变得“普通平常”，不再是那些具有雄辩天赋的人的专利。,"Discourse became ‘common’, no longer the exclusive privilege of those who possessed the gift of eloquence."
5245,所有人现在都平等拥有演讲的权利，理性的语言被认为最能契合这一目标。,"All members of the community were now judged to possess equally the right to speech, and it was the rational language of logos that was thought to best fulfil this purpose."
5245,如此一来，理性就被引入到在公共场所相遇的人们中间。,Thus logos was brought into the encounters of the public square.
5246,简要来说，这一历史包括种族、性别和天性的概念。,
5246,总的说来，人类学和其他社会科学巳经拒绝了那种认为种族、性别和天性是生物学或伪生物学原因所致的解释，转而强调社会和文化因素。,"On the whole, anthropology and other social sciences have rejected explanations that assume such biological or pseudobiological causes as race, gender, and instinct and have emphasized instead social and cultural factors."
5246,实际上，“文化”这一概念的发明和发展，部分就是想要解释那些自然原因（种族、性别、天性）无法说清的行为差异。,"In fact, the invention and development of the concept of culture are in part an attempt to explain behavioral differences where the natural (racial, gender, or instinctual) explanations failed."
5247,第2章考虑方法，即人类学家着手学习他们所学到的方式。,Chapter 2 treats method: the way anthropologists go about learning what they learn.
5247,田野工作是人类学最有特色的方法。,Fieldwork is the distinctive method of anthropology.
5247,田野工作所独有的身体考验、心理偏差和智力挑战相融合的要求，只有那些亲身做过田野工作的人才能真切地理解。,"The peculiarly demanding combination of physical hardship, psychological disorientation, and intellectual challenge that constitutes fieldwork can be understood only by those who have done it."
5247,实际上，即使对这些人来说，由于记忆很容易变模糊，很难对其体验作出准确的回忆和描述。,"In fact, even for these, memory dims, so that the experience is difficult to recall and describe sharply."
5248,民族志写作的一个亚体裁出现了：自我反思的“田野工作叙述”。,"A subgenre of ethnographic writing emerged, the self-reflexive ""fieldwork account."""
5248,或世故或天真，或自白或分析，这些叙述为讨论认识论、存在和政治的广泛议题提供了重要的论坛。,"Variously sophisticated and naive, confessional and analytic, these accounts provide an important forum for the discussion of a wide range of issues, epistemological, existential, and political."
5248,文化分析家的话语不再可能仅仅是一个“有经验”的观察者对习俗的描述和阐释。,"The discourse of the cultural analyst can no longer be simply that of the ""experienced"" observer, describing and interpreting custom."
5248,民族志的经验和参与观察的理想被证明是有问题的。,Ethnographic experience and the participant-observation ideal are shown to be problematic.
5248,不同的文本策略得到尝试。,Different textual strategies are attempted.
5248,例如，按照新的惯例采用第一人称单数 (民族志从来没有禁止过第一人称单数，民族志总是个人风格化的。,"For example, the first person singular (never banned from ethnographies, which were always personal in stylized ways) is deployed according to new conventions."
5249,在社会或文化人类学领域，学者们经常区分“田野民族志”和“理论”这两个概念。,"In social or cultural anthropology, a distinction is often made between ‘ethnography’ and ‘theory’."
5249,从字面意义上说，田野民族志是关于民族的写作实践。,Ethnography is literally the practice of writing about peoples.
5249,因为人类学家通常更多地研究异文化而不是自己的文化，所以田野民族志常常意味着我们理解其他民族思维模式的方法。,"Often it is taken to mean our way of making sense of other peoples’ modes of thought, since anthropologists usually study cultures other than their own."
5249,而在某种程度上，理论也可以说是我们理解自身、理解人类学思维模式的途径。,"Theory is also, in part anyway, our way of making sense of our own, anthropological mode of thought."
5250,在平等群体中，进行交易的各个人之间都彼此认识且有亲属关系，而且大多数人都看重“和睦相处”，因此冲突产生的潜在可能性很小。,"In egalitarian groups, where everyone is related to—and knows on a personal basis—everyone else with whom dealings are required and where most everyone values ""getting along"" with the natural order of life, the potential for conflicts to develop is reduced in the first place."
5250,如果冲突真的产生，那么大都通过闲言碎语、嘲笑、直接谈判或者调解等非正式方式加以解决在后面这些情况中，重点在于获取大多数当事方都认为公正的解决方案，而不是遵循某条抽象的法律或规则。,"Many of those that do arise are settled informally through gossip, ridicule, direct negotiation, or mediation.In the latter instances, the emphasis is on achieving a solution considered just by most parties concerned, rather than conforming to some abstract law or rule."
5250,如果其他解决方法都失败了，不满意的个人还可以选择离开这个臥群，到另一个自己有亲属的队群中去生活。,"Where all else fails, disgruntled individuals have the option of leaving the band to go live in another where they have relatives."
5251,调适过程确立了人的需求与其环境潜能的动态平衡。,The adaptation process establishes a moving balance between the needs of a population and the potential of its environment.
5251,新几内亚高原居民甄巴加人的例子可以说明这一过程。甄巴加人维持自己的生活主要靠园艺(horticulture)—用简单的手工工具种植庄稼。,"This process can be illustrated by the Tsembaga, New Guinea, high landers, who support themselves chiefly through horticulture—the cultivation of crops carried out with simple hand tools."
5252,尽管在永久定居的农业社区中人们积累财物的机会增加了，但是对财产获取的限制在他们那里就如在游牧民族那里一样显著。,"In spite of the increased opportunities in sedentary farming communities for people to accumulate belongings, limits on property acquisition may be as prominent in them as among nomadic peoples."
5252,在这类社区中，社会义务迫使人们放弃财富，而且没有人被允许积累比他人多得多的财富。更多的财富只不过招来要承担的更多的社会义务。,"In such communities, social obligations compel people ro divest themselves of wealth, and no one is permitted to accumulate too much more than others.Greater wealth simply brings greater obligation to give."
5252,人类学家把这类义务称为调整机制（leveling mechanisms） 。,Anthropologists refer ro such obligations as leveling mechanisms.
5253,作为对现代经济体制日益增长的“面对无面”性质的部分反应，美国“跳蚤市场”（参见图7.3），有某种程度的复苏和增长。在“跳蚤市场”，任何人，付一小笔费用，就可以展示和销售手工艺品、二手货、农产品以及在面对面情境下作的绘画。,"The United States, as part of a reaction to the increasingly ""face-to-faceless"" nature of the modern economic system, is having something of a revival and proliferation of ""flea markets"" (Figure 7.3), where anyone, for a small fee, may display and sell handicrafts, secondhand items, farm produce, and paintings in a face-to-face setting."
5253,寻找便宜货和讨价还价的机会有令人兴奋的因素。,Excitement is felt in the search for bargains and an opportunity for haggling.
5253,到处弥漫着欢乐的气氛，有吃有喝，欢声笑语，以及交谈，而且货物交易甚至可能没有任何现金过手。,"A carnival atmosphere prevails, with eating, laughing, and conversation, and items even may be bartered without any cash passing hands."
5253,这些跳蚤市场、商品交易会、节期和农民市场类似于非西方社会的集市。,"These flea markets, including fairs, festivals, and farmers' markets, are similar to the marketplaces of non-Western societies."
5254,这一问题的答案就像人类历史一样复杂。,The answer to this is as complex as human history.
5254,在某种程度上说，它与人类的技术局限有关。,"In part, it relates to the limits of human technology."
5254,在大部分历史中，人们一直受限于他们的地理范围。,"Throughout most of history, people have been restricted in their geographical horizons."
5254,没有到世界遥远地方旅行的手段，对远远不同于人们自己的文化和民族的观察是艰难的——如果不是不可能的话——冒险。,"Without the means for one to travel to distant parts of the world, observation of cultures and peoples far from one's own area was a difficult— if not impossible—venture."
5254,大范围的旅行通常是少数人独享的特权；只有当适当的运输和通信方式得到发展，对其他民族和文化的研究才可能盛行。,Extensive travel was usually the exclusive prerogative of a few; the study of foreign peoples and cultures was not likely to flourish until adequate modes of transportation and communication could be developed.
5255,后来，维克多·特纳（Victor Turner 1982a）提出，分类和不分类之间的这种认知性与社会性的摆动是人类生活中一项永恒的动态。,"Victor Turner (1982a), finally, argued for an oscillation, cognitive and social, between the classificatory and the non-classificatory as constituting a universal dynamics of human life."
5255,人在固有结构和反结构之间摆动，在分类和一体统一之间摆动，但人类文化应当被视为同时包含了这两个方面。,"Human beings oscillated between inhabiting structure and anti-structure, between division and homogeneity, but human culture must be seen as comprising both."
5255,日常生活由现有的社会秩序制约：根据分门别类的象征体系内的位置和角色区分人与物。,"Everyday life, then, was characterized by a status-bound social order: persons and things differentiated according to their positions and roles in a segmentary symbolic system."
5255,不过，特定时期中人会诉求并回复到相反的方面，即某种可称为“同感”（communitas）或全方位交流的原始状态的关系。,"However, at periodic intervals human beings resorted and reverted to an antithetical, indeed primordial, modality of relationship characterized by ‘communitas’ or total communion."
5256,事实上，许多创造了人与人之间持久稳固的约束力的亲属制度系统并不是那些我们所谓的“血族”。,"Indeed, many kinship systems create enduring and strong commitments between people who are not what we would call ""blood relatives""."
5256,要在这种理论框架下解释存在于大多数社会中的同性恋，似乎也很困难。,"Homosexuality, which exists in most societies, also seems difficult to explain within this framework."
5256,威尔逊在他最近的著作（Wilson 1998）中似乎调整了他的观点，并且呼吁跨学科的合作而不是将一门学科（人类学）包含在另一门学科（生物学）之内。,"In his most recent work, Wilson (1998) seems to have modified his views, and calls for cooperation across disciplinary boundaries rather than subsuming one (anthropology) under the other (biology)."
5256,总的来说，大约自1980年代晚期，达尔文对人类生命的解读的拥护者已经修正了他们以前强烈的决定论的观点。,"Generally, adherents of Darwinist interpretations of human life have modified their formerly strongly determinist views since – roughly – the late 1980s."
5256,如今文化不再被当做一种偶发现象，并且没有人会认真地宣称，文化现象必然是“发挥生物功能的”或是适应的结果。,"Culture is no longer regarded as an epiphenomenon, and nobody would seriously claim today that cultural phenomena are necessarily ""biologically functional"" or adaptive."
5257,由于规模较大的资本主义公司越来越依赖贫穷国家的低成本商品制造业，使用童工已成为工业社会日益引人关注的问题。,The use of child labor has become a matter of increasing concern as large corporations rely more frequently on the manufacture of goods in the world's poorer countries.
5257,"虽然可靠的数字难以获得,但据估计，仅在南亚就有约1500万不自由的童工，包括一些4岁的幼童。","Although reliable figures are hard to come by, it is estimated that there are some 15 million indentured child laborers in south Asia alone, including some as young as 4 years old."
5257,每年，美国进口的产品，至少有价值1亿美元的产品是领微薄工资的童工制作的，产品包括小地毯、地毯、服装和足球等等。,"Each year, the United States imports at least $100 million worth of products children manufacture, ranging from rugs and carpets to clothing and soccer balls."
5257,早在比尔·克林顿任总统期间，他就签署法律，阻止由被迫从事雇佣劳动的儿童制造的产品进口。但强制实施这一法律能有多大效果，我们还没有看到。,"In 1990, President Clinton signed into law legislation that would prevent importation of products made by children who are indentured servants, but how effectively it can be enforced still remains to be seen."
5258,米歇尔˙福柯对于权力关系的研究为我们提供了某些有益的分析工具。,The work of Michel Foucault on power relations provides us with some helpful analytic tools.
5258,福柯（Fpucault 1982:212)在剥削、支配与主体之间作了区分。,"Foucault distinguishes between exploitation, domination, and subjection (1982:212)."
5258,"他认为，大多数权力的分析几乎无一例外地都集中在支配与剥削的关系上,谁在控制谁以及谁从生产者的生产中擭取成果。","He argues that most analyses of power concentrate almost exclusively on relations of domination and exploitation: who controls whom, and who extracts the fruits of production from the producers."
5258,第三个术语：主体，集中在一个权力场域中离开力的直接应用最为遥远的向度上。,"The third term, subjection, focuses on that aspect of a field of power farthest removed from the direct application of force."
5258,权力关系的那一维度就是个体与群体的认同经受考验之所，那里也是体现最宽泛意义的秩序形态之所。,"That dimension of power relations is where the identity of individuals and groups is at stake, and where order in its broadest meaning is taking form."
5258,这是文化与权力最为紧密地交织在一起的王国。,This is there a lm in which culture and power are most closely intertwined.
5258,"福柯有时会称这些关系为“统怀""(governmentality)，而这个术语便是一个有益的术语。","Foucault sometimes calls these relations ""governmentality,"" and the term is a helpful one."
5259,实证主义模型是理性的，但它的合理性是由观察者而不是行动员来确定的。,"The positivist model is rational, but it is rationality as defined by the observer rather than by the actor."
5259,事先确定你的假说、合理性和效率，决定了你的测试只与那些相关的数据相联系。,"Having defined your hypothesis, rationality and efficiency dictate that you limit your test to only those data that are relevant."
5259,相应地，你也就通过你的做法创造了这些数据。,"Accordingly, you create these data, manufacture them through your procedure."
5259,在心理学中，这一做法通常是实验；在社会学中，这一做法是调查问卷；在经济学中，这一做法则是各种各样的统计测量。,"In psychology, this procedure is typically the experiment; in sociology, the survey questionnaire; in economics, various kinds of statistical measurement."
5260,1832年，第一次正式说明女性没有投票权。,"In 1832, it had been formally clarified for the first time that women could not vote."
5260,到 1867年，妇女的投票权问题已经长期成为女权主义者一个重要的问题，显然，投票权是公民身份的一个象征。,"By 1867, women's suffrage had been an important issue for feminist groups for a long time, for it was clear that the vote was the symbolic crux of citizenship."
5260,有人开展组织了一场请愿活动，致力于使女性获得和男性一样的投票权。约翰·斯图亚特·穆勒 (John Stuart Mill)在国会下议院代表她们提出了这个议题。,"A petition was organised seeking the vote for women on the same terms as men, and John Stuart Mill raised the subject in the House of Commons on their behalf."
5261,天人合一的古典模式叫作“图腾崇拜”。,"The classic pattern of nature/humanunity is known as ""totemism""."
5261,在图腾社会，每个群体都会有一个特有的与一个自然。类别相连的特征：例如熊氏族、狮氏族、狼氏族。,"In totemic societies, each group identifies with a natural category: bear, lion, wolf clans, for example."
5261,在某些领域我们仍然存在一些这方面的残余，例如体育队的名字——狼窝（the Wolfpack )、老虎（the Tigers)和水龟（the Terrapins)。,"We have pale remnants of this in some spheres, such as sports team names – the Wolfpack, the Yellow-Jackets, the Tigers, and the Terrapins."
5262,多贡人住在马里共和国（Mali）东南部干旱的大草原上，接近布基纳法索（Burkina Faso）的边界（Beaudoin 1984），游牧的富拉尼人也住在这里。,"The Dogon live on the dry savannah in south-eastern Mali, near the border with Burkina Faso (Beaudoin 1984), in an area where nomadic Fulani also live."
5262,多贡人是不迁徙的农民，他们种植小米、水果和蔬菜。,"They are sedentary farmers and cultivate millet, fruit and vegetables."
5262,他们住在村子里，这些村子传统上形成了独立的政治实体。,They live in villages which traditionally make up independent political entities.
5262,这些村子在许多方面都是自给自足的，他们有自己的农民、政治领袖、工匠、田地和公共仪式。,"These villages are in many ways self-sufficient, with their own farmers, political leaders, craftsmen, fields and public rituals."
5262,通过以下事实可见，这些村子明显处于自治的状态：该地区的政治冲突常常发生在不同的村子之间，起因是对土地权利的不同意见或在几个村子共同的集市上的争吵。,"The autonomy of the villages is evident through the fact that political conflicts in the area are frequently conflicts between villages, caused by disagreements over land rights or disputes at the market-place, where inhabitants from different villages meet."
5262,多贡村落的居民点按照继嗣从属关系划分。,The settlements in the Dogon villages are divided according to lineage membership.
5262,每个家系都有权利耕作特定的田地，居住在村子里标示出的地方。,Each lineage has rights to cultivate specific fields and lives in a delineated part of the village.
5263,它们的用法代表了一种亚文化和社会关系中特定形式的功能（而不是个体心理学）。,Their usage was a function of subculture and of particular forms of social relationship (rather than individual psychology).
5263,那么，严格代码是适用于“地位取向”的社会环境和社会关系，例如军队、监狱、年龄级次、长期建立的友谊与婚姻，而精细代码则适用于“个人取向”的那些社会环境和社会关系。,"Hence, restricted code pertained to ""position-oriented"" social milieux and relations—armies, prisons, age-grades, long-established friendships and marriages—while elaborated code pertained to ""person oriented"" ones."
5263,特别是这两种编码的使用方法将劳工阶级与中产阶级区分开 来；劳工阶级的社会性和团结的“基因”通过严格代码传导，而中产阶级的社会性和个体性的基因则通过精细代码传异。,"In particular, the two codificatory usages differentiated the working class from the middle class; the ""genes"" of working-class sociality and solidarity were transmitted by restricted code, while the genes of middle-class sociality and individuality were transmitted by elaborated code."
5264,不管乱伦禁忌是由什么引起的，考察它对社会结构的影响，我们可以看到它的效用。,"Whatever its cause, the utility of the incest taboo can be seen by examining its effects on social structure."
5264,与反对乱伦密切相关是反对内婚制（endogamy），即在特定的个人（譬如堂 兄弟姐妹和堂表姐妹夫或堂表嫂或弟媳等）的群体内婚配的规则。,"Closely related to prohibitions against incest are rules against endogamy, or marriage within a particular group of individuals (cousins and inlaws, for example)."
5264,如果该群体只被定义为直系家庭，那么社会一般禁止或至少劝阻内婚制f因而鼓励外婚制(exogamy)，即在该群体之外的婚配。,"If the group is defined as one's immediate family alone, then societies generally prohibit or at least discourage endogamy and practice or at least encourage exogamy, or marriage outside the group."
5264,然而，在某一级上实行外婚制的社会，可能在另一级上实行内婚制。,Yet a society that practices exogamy at one level may practice endogamy at another.
5264,例如，在特罗布里恩德岛民中，每个人都必须在其氏族或世系群之外婚配（外婚制）。,"Among the Trobriand Islanders, for exam- ple, each individual has to marry outside of his or her own clan and lineage (exogamy)."
5265,为什么这一外省很重要？,Why this extrospective emphasis?
5265,一个简单的答复就是，基于单独一个人（譬如你自已）来推论人性是有风险的。,"The simple answer is that it is risky to generalize about humanity based on a single human, yourself."
5265,同理，基于只知道一种文化（譬如你自己的文化）来推论所有文化，也是有风险的。,"Likewise, it is risky to generalize about all cultures based on knowing only one, your own."
5265,这个答案虽则有其合理性，但却还是显得有些太过简单。,"This answer, though valid to a point, is too simple."
5265,它在启我与他者、主体与客体、内省与外省之间，划出了一条太过清晰的界限。,"It draws too sharp a line between self and other, subjectivity and objectivity, introspection and extrospection."
5266,泰勒的宗教理论由一套源自“万物有灵论”的进化论图式组成。这种包括一切的学说认为，灵魂（拉丁语 animi 或 animae) 独立于物质世界而存在。,"Tylor’s theory of religion consisted of a scheme of evolution from ‘animism’, the all-embracing doctrine that souls (Latin animi or animae) exist independently of the material world."
5266,他指出，从实质上说，每个人类社会都有灵魂在生命死后依然存在的共同信仰。,"He noted that in virtually every human society, there is a common belief in a spiritual essence which survives death."
5267,道格拉斯（Mary Douglas)的网格与群体理论。,Mary Douglas's theory of grid and group.
5267,道格拉斯将群体共同生活区分为两个方面：内部（网格，将一个人与另一个人联系起来并进行分类的网络）和外部（群体，与其界限之外相对的共同体的身份认同）。,"Douglas distinguishes two dimensions of group communal life: the internal (grid, which is the network that binds and classifies persons in relation to one another) and the external(group, the community's identity contrasted to those outside its boundaries)."
5267,然后，她根据这两个维度怎样结合到一起对社区进行分类。,She then classifies communities according to how these two dimensions combine.
5267,在古典社会，群体和网格都很强。,"In the classic Gemeinschaft, both group and grid are strong."
5268,由于这种冲动是个体天生的，因此巴塔耶实际上是用一种与意志和权力相关的现象学群体心理学来对涂尔干式的理性主义社会学进行了补充。这种心理学承袭自弗洛伊德、尼采、黑格尔，甚至与马基·德·萨德（Marquis de Sade），后者代表了一种打破性禁忌的极端形式。,"And since this urge inhered in individuals, Bataille supplemented rationalist Durkheimian sociology with a form of phenomenological collective psychology that was linked to ideas of will and power drawn from Freud, Nietzsche, Hegel, and even the Marquis de Sade, who represented in an extreme form the violation of sexual taboos."
5268,这种非理性冲动不但以违反禁忌的阻断替代了对禁忌的禁止，而且还代表了一种意愿，这种意愿会威胁到被社会和那些非理性的人推崇为神圣之物的东西，尽管非理性冲动也释放出了新的活力。,"Not only did this irrational urge replace the interdiction of taboos with their transgression, it also represented a will to endanger what was sacred to society and to those who belonged to it, though this also released revitalizing energies."
5269,后者认为，我们这个世界与生俱来的对不稳定性和创造性的偏好，绝对控制和精确预苫的不可能性，以及对人们在世界中的行动的处境的更清楚的看法，都使自然科学和社会科学的研究计划彼此靠得更近。,"For Prigogine, an appreciation of the instability and creativity inherent in our world, the impossibility of absolute control or precise forecasting, and a clearer view of the place of human activity-within-the-world, now bring the projects of natural science and social science close to one another."
5269,对两者来说，陈旧的决定论、唯物论和还原论观念在我们想象、表达自己的知识，并据此行动时都必须为“叙述性的因素”让路。,"In both, old notions of determinism, materialism and reductionism, of knowledge as omniscient and timeless, must give way to ""a narrative element"" in the way we conceive of our knowledge, represent it, and act upon its implications."
5269,因为，“实际上，所有人的社会互动和所有文献所表达的都是未来的不确定性，以及对未来的建构（Prigogine1989：389),
5270,在田野工作中，人类学家面对道德问题，必须解决他和群体都受到影响的实际任务。,"In fieldwork, the anthropologist faces ethical questions, he must solve practical tasks, and, like it or not, both he and the group are affected."
5270,我在印度尼西亚所做的第一份田野工作，将我抛入一个和我们住在一起的贫困家庭从事特定交易中以挣钱糊口。,My first field work in Indonesia threw me into certain dealings to get money for an impoverished family with whom we were living.
5270,三十多年后，我仍然在参与维持另一个印度尼西亚家庭的生存，由于政治迫害，其养家糊口的人（我的亲密朋友）消失了。,"More than thirty years later, I still participate in the subsistence of another Indonesian family, whose breadwinner, my close friend, has disappeared because of political persecution."
5271,在这个焦点之内，我们不能吸收女性主义所生发的关于民族志文本实践的任何展开的思考。,Within this focus we could not draw on any developed debates generated by feminism on ethnographic textual practices.
5271,少数初露端倪的书或文章（例如，Atkinson 1982；Roberts，ed.1981)都是已出版过的，这一情形后来也没有显著改变。,"A few very initial indications (for example, Atkinson 1982; Roberts, ed. 1981) were all that had been published.And the situation has not changed dramatically since."
5271,女性主义无疑对人类学理论作出了贡献。,Feminism clearly has contributed to anthropological theory.
5271,不同的女人类学家，像安妮特˙韦纳（Weiner 1976)，都在踊跃地改写大男子主义的经典。,"And various female ethnographers, like Annette Weiner (1976), are actively rewriting the masculinist canon."
5271,但女性主义民族志的焦点，或者是忠实地记录妇女的经验，或者是修正人类学范畴(例如文化/自然的对立）。,"But feminist ethnography has focused either on setting the record straight about women or on revising anthropological categories (for example, the nature/culture opposition)."
5271,它还没有生产出非传统的写作形式，或对民族志的文本性等问题进行深入反思。,It has not produced either unconventional forms of writing or a developed reflection on ethnographic textuality as such.
5272,对列维－斯特劳斯来说，乱伦禁忌是（人类）本性的一部分，因为它存在于所有社会之中。但乱伦禁忌也是文化的本质，因为不同文化对它的定义各不相同。,"For Le ́vi-Strauss, the incest taboo is part of (human) nature because it is present in all societies, but it is the essence of culture because it is defined differently from culture to culture."
5272,列维－斯特劳斯指出，有些文化禁止交表兄弟姊妹之间发生性关系，而另一些文化则恰好承认将表兄弟姊妹的范畴作为允许发生性关系的一种类别。,"Some cultures, Le ́vi-Strauss points out, prohibit sex between cross-cousins, while other cultures recognize the category of cross-cousins as precisely the one within which sex is allowed."
5273,在人类学中，文化比较不必局限于民族学的资料。,"In anthropology, cultural comparisons need nor be restricted to ethnographic data."
5273,例如，人类学家可以转向考古学的或历史的资料以检验有关文化变迁的假说。,"Anthropologists can, for example, turn to archaeological data to test hypotheses about cultural change."
5273,被认为因为某种特殊条件引起的文化特质，考古学可以通过研究这种条件过去事实上发生的处境对其加以检验。,Cultural characteristics thought to be caused by certain specified conditions can be tested archaeologically by investigating situations where such conditions actually occurred.
5273,民族史学（Ethnohistory）是一种历史民族学，通过口述历史，探险者、传教士和商人的描述，以及通过对地名、生死记录和其他档案材料的分析来研究最近的文化。,"Also useful are data the ethnohistorian provides.Ethnohistory is a kind of historic ethnography that studies cultures of the recent past through oral histories; through the accounts of explorers, missionaries, and traders; and through the analysis of data such as land titles, birth and death records, and other archival materials."
5274,暗含在这其中的是贝特森用希腊语eidos (文化表象）和ethos (文化精神）界定的两种概念的区分。,Implicit in all this is a distinction between two concepts which Bateson called by the Greek words eidos and ethos.
5274,文化由这两者构成（参见 Bateson 1958 [1936]: 123-151，198 -256)。,"Culture is made up of both (see, e.g., Bateson 1958 [1936]: 123–51, 198–256)."
5274,按照贝特森的用法，文化表象就是我们通常所说的“形式”或“结构”（参见Kroeber 1963 [1948]: 100 -103)。,"In Bateson’s usage, eidos is what we more generally call ‘form’ or ‘structure’ (cf. Kroeber 1963 [1948]: 100–3)."
5274,贝特森在国民性研究中所描述的两组对立（旁观者和表现癖；控制和服从）是英美两国文化文化表象的一部分。,The sets of oppositions he describes in his study of national character (spectatorship v. exhibitionism; dominance v. submission) are part of the eidos of American and of English culture.
5275,来自这类研究的一个重要的发现是，它产生了其他社会科学家所做的那类研究通常不会形成的知识。,An important discovery from such research is it produces knowledge that usually does not emerge from the kinds of research other social scientists do.
5275,例如，在20世纪60年代产生的文化剥夺理论，人们用它来解释对许多少数民族儿童教肓的失败。,"For example, the theory of cultural deprivation arose during the 1960s as a way to explain the educational failure of many children of minorities."
5275,为了说明他们缺乏教育成就的原因，一些社会科学家提出，这类儿童“在文化方面受到了剥夺”。,"To account for the students' lack of achievement, some social scientists proposed that such children were ""culturally deprived""."
5275,然后，他们着手研究大部分来自美国原住民、非洲裔美国人、两班牙裔美国人家庭的儿童，通过他们的理论框架解释邦研究成果来进一步“确认”这一观点。,"They then proceeded to ""confirm"" this idea by studying children, mostly from Native American, African American, and Hispanic populations, interpreting the results through the protective screen of their theory."
5275,相比较而言，对“义化上受剥夺”儿童的文化所做的民族学研究揭示不同的情况。,"By contrast, ethnographic research on the cultures of ""culturally deprived"" children reveals a different story."
5276,既然一个单一、同质的世界文化并不必然是未来的潮流，那么什么才是呢？,"Since a homogeneous world culture is not necessarily the wave of the future, what is?"
5276,有人把文化多元主义（cultural pluralism) 这个社会中存在不止一种文化视为人类的未来状态。,"Some see cultural pluralism, in which more than one culture exists in a given society, as the future condition of humanity."
5276,文化多元主义是指在同一个社会或多民族国家内具有不同生活和思维方式的人们的社会和政治互动。,Cultural pluralism is the social and political interaction of people with different ways of living and thinking within the same society or multinational state.
5276,理想中的文化多元主义意味着抛弃偏执、偏见种族主义，倡导对其他公民的不同文化传统的尊重。,"Ideally, it implies a rejection of bigotry, bias, and racism in favor of respect for the cultural traditions of other peoples."
5276,事实上，还很少有人那样理解。,"In reality, it has rarely worked out that way."
5277,我们在后面会详细谈论到复杂的国家社会的政治和政治文化，特别是在第十六章和第十九章的文化复杂性的语境中。,"The politics and political culture of complex state societies are dealt with in greater detail later, notably in the context of cultural complexity in Chapters 16 to 19."
5277,不过，这里会涉及国家政治的一些方面，部分地是为了避免产生世界上的多数社会都是无政府的这样的印象。,"Nevertheless a few aspects of state politics are considered here, partly to avoid the impression that most societies in the world are stateless."
5277,当然不是如此，尽管在地方社区之间，国家政府的功能有很大差别——从几乎没有功能到在多数公共事态中发挥重要。,"They certainly are not, although the role of the state varies greatly between local communities – from being nearly absent to being an important actor in most public situations."
5277,一些人，如皮埃尔·克拉斯特斯（Pierre Clastres 1977），会认为国家的出现和无政府民族被强迫合并成的国家，是文化历史上最重要的分水岭。,"Some, like Pierre Clastres (1977), would regard the emergence of the state, and the enforced incorporation of non-state peoples into the state, as the most important watershed in cultural history."
5278,在社会的谋生方式中起作用的文化因素被称为文化核心（culture core）。,The cultural features that play a part in the society's way of making its living are called its culture core.
5278,它包括社会对于可利用资源的生产技术和知识。,This includes the society productive techniques and its knowledge of the resources available to it.
5278,它也包括涉及把这种技术应用于地方环境的劳动方式。,It encompasses the patterns of labor involved in applying those techniques to the local environment.
5278,例如，人类是否每日工作固定的小时数？或者是否在一年的某段时间集中做大部分工作？,"For example, do people work every day for a fixed number of hours, or is most work concentrated during certain times of the year?"
5278,文化核心规定那些影响食物生产和分配的义化的其他方面。,The culture core also includes other aspects of culture that bear on the production and distribution of food.
5278,意识形态可能间接影响生存，它的影响方式的例了可以在一些文化中看到。在这些文化中，宗教可能使人们能利用当地可获取的和有营养价值的食物。,Examples of the way ideology can indirectly affect subsistence can be seen in a number of cultures where religion may lead to failure to use both locally available and nutritionally valuable foods.
5279,当美国人类学超越博厄斯的极端相对论重拾进化论时，进化与传播之间的相互变得更为明显。,The interplay between evolution and diffusion became yet more apparent when American anthropology left behind the extreme relativism of Boas to take up evolutionism again.
5279,在斯图尔德的著作中，它具有特殊的意义。,Thus it took on special meaning in Steward’s work.
5279,我们已经在第三章介绍过这位多线进化论的设计者，但是他理论也有传播论的基础。,"We met him in chapter 3 as the architect of multilinear evolutionism, but his theories also had a diffusionist basis."
5279,"这里至关紧要的是他对“文化核心”(culture core)和“总体文化"" (total culture）的区分。",Crucial here is his distinction between the ‘cultural core’ (which is determined by environment and evolution) and the ‘total culture’ (which contains elements of culture susceptible to diffusion).
5280,传播主义带有文化决定论的萌芽。,Diffusionism contained the seeds of cultural determinism.
5280,文化决定论在博厄斯的相对论中发展到了极致。,
5280,,This was elevated to an extreme with the relativism of Franz Boas.
5280,后来，大西洋两岸的阐释主义者和近时的后现代主义者都反对先前对社会结构的强调，反对社会过程的单一视角。,"Later, interpretivists on both sides of the Atlantic and the postmodernists of recent times all reacted against previous emphases on social structure and monolithic visions of social process."
5281,由于早期原人女性已潜在地随时可以性交，所以占支配地位的男性可能会试图独占这些女性；另外的诱因可能是女性在食物采集中的出色本领。,"With early hominine females potentially ready for sexual intercourse at any time, dominant males may have attempted to monopolize females; an added inducement could have been the prowess of the female at food gathering."
5281,（在寻食社会中，妇女通常凭借她们的采集活动提供大量食物。,"(In food-foraging societies, women usually provide the bulk of the food by their gathering activities.)"
5281,）不管怎样，独占女性的倾向会把竞争、好斗的因素引入原人集群中去，在其他许多灵长目动物中有这种集群，集群不可能允许这一因素破坏和谐的社会关系。,"In any event, a tendency to monopolize females would introduce the kind of competitive, combative element into hominine groupings seen among many other primate species —an element that cannot be allowed to disrupt harmonious social relationships."
5281,解决这一难题的办法是把性活动置于文化的控制之下。,The solution to this problem is to bring sexual activity under cultural control.
5281,因此，就如文化告诉人们应治吃什么、什么时候吃以及怎样吃，它也告诉他们应当在何时、何地、如何以及与谁发生性行为。,"Thus, just as a culture tells people what, when, and how they should eat, so does it tell them when, where, how, and with whom they should have sex."
5282,"要探究特定地区的内部差异，人类学家朱利安˙斯图尔德提出了文化类型（culture type）概念,这概念指的是，一般跨文化发生的文化中各要素的集合，而且涉及一种特殊技术以及该技术与它所对付的环境特征的关系。","To deal with variations within a given region, anthropologist Julian Steward proposed the concept of culture type, or consideration of a culture in terms of a particular technology and its relationship with the environmental features that technology is equipped to deal with."
5282,大盆地的例子表明，技术怎么有助于决定正好什么环境特征是有用的。,The example of the Great Plains shows how technology helps decide just which environmental features will be useful.
5282,曾养活狩猎野牛者的同一片草原现在供养着牧牛者和农民。,Those same prairies that once supported buffalo hunters now support grain farmers.
5282,印第安人不从事农耕，不是由于环境的缘故，也不是因为缺乏农业知识，因为他们某些人——如切延内人——在迁移到大平原之前已种植谷物了。,"The Indians were prevented from farming the plains not for environmental reasons, nor for lack of knowledge about farming, since some of them, such as the Cheyenne, had been farmers before they moved onto the plains."
5283,"怀特的“灵长目革命"" (Primate Revolution)  概念也是一个明显例子。",White’s notion of a ‘Primate Revolution’ is also a clear example.
5283,然而，变革论只在20世纪80年代才以其自己的能力作为一种范式出现，在这之前曾经是进化论和反进化论（在此意义上，它将瞬间变化置于缓慢进化之上）（比如 Cucchiari 1981)。,"Yet it emerged as a paradigm in its own right – at once evolutionist and anti-evolutionist (in the sense that it puts instantaneous change over slow evolution) – only in the 1980s (e.g., Cucchiari 1981)."
5283,今天它的主要特色是研究象征 文化的起源，或文化起源 (culturo-genesis)。,"Its central feature today is the search for the origin of symbolic culture, or culturo-genesis."
5284,大平原原住民文化区（culture area）(参见图6.1)，是有相似生活方式的许多社会存在的地理区域。,The aboriginal culture area of the Great Plains (Figure 6.1) was a geographic region where a number of societies with similar ways of life existed.
5284,31个政治上独立的民族（其中前面提到的切延内人和科曼奇人是两个例外）都面临一个共同的环境，在这种环境里，野牛是食物以及衣服和居所原料的明显和实际的来源。,"Thirty-one politically independent peoples (the aforementioned Cheyenne and Comanche were but two of them) faced a common environment, in which the buffalo was an obvious and practical source of food as well as materials for clothing and shelter."
5284,因为他们相邻而居，所以他们能够分享新的发明和发现。,"Living close by each other, the nations could share new inventions and discoveries."
5284,他们达成对特殊生态地带共同的和共有的调适。,They reached a common and shared adaptation to a particular ecological zone.
5285,"20世纪30年代左右，传播论的重要性逐渐式微之时，它遗留下来的一些理念为其他理论传统所采用：“文化区域"" (culture areas) 思想是其中最突出的例子。","By the time diffusionism was dwindling in importance, around the 1930s, it had left behind ideas which were picked up within other traditions: the idea of ‘culture areas’ is the most prominent example."
5285,这一思想已经成为弗兰兹·博厄斯及其追随者田野民族志传统中重要的一方面（参见第七章）。,This had already become an important facet of the ethnographic tradition of Franz Boas and his followers (see chapter 7).
5285,它也出现在朱利安·斯图尔德的进化论（第三章）以及在20 世纪前半期出现的功能主义、结构主义传统中（第五章及第八章）。,It also appeared within the evolutionism of Julian Steward (chapter 3) and within the functionalist and structuralist traditions which emerged in the Wrst half of the twentieth century (chapters 5 and 8).
5286,弗罗贝纽斯是一位自学成才的非洲探险家、博物馆民族学家，热衷于寻找世界范围内文化发展中的相似性。,"Frobenius, a self-trained African explorer and museum ethnologist, enjoyed looking for parallels in cultural development worldwide."
5286,他发展了“文化圈” (Kulturkreise )的观点，设想在某些个案中，一些大的文化区域扩散至全球，并且与各地以前就存在的文化区域互相交叠，例如，弓箭文化覆盖枪矛文化。,"He came up with the idea of ‘culture circles’ (Kulturkreise), conceived as great culture areas which in some cases spread across the globe and overlapped those which had existed before: for example, bow-and-arrow culture over spear culture."
5286,19世纪90年代至20世纪30年代，这些文化圈的阐述在德国和奥地利人类学界占据支配地位。,
5286,,The definition of these culture circles was to dominate German and Austrian anthropology from the 1890s to the 1930s.
5287,当两个主要的倡导者在1954年和1961年分别退休和去世后，施密特和柯珀斯的历史传播论的神学版本早早地结束了。,"Historical diffusionism's theological version under Schmidt and Koppers came to an early end when its two main proponents retired and died in 1954 and 1961, respectively."
5287,柯珀斯的继任者约瑟夫˙哈克尔（Joseph HaekelM自学院建立后，他是这一职位上首位奥地利出生的非牧师）连同罗伯特˙海因-杰尔登（流亡后又移民回来的少数人之一）及其助手安娜˙霍恩瓦特-杰拉克史泰因（Anna Hohenwart Gerlachstein)以及沃尔特˙赫什伯格，接着很快宣布了施密特的文化圈理论过时了。,"Koppers's successor, Josef Haekel (the first Austrianborn nonpriest in this chair since the institute's foundation), together with Robert Heine-Geldern (one of the few re-migrants from exile), his assistant Anna Hohenwart-Gerlachstein, and Walter Hirschberg, soon thereafter declared Schmidt's culture circle theory obsolete."
5287,被关闭的圣言会人类学学派也走到了尽头，从那个时候开始，圣言会的理论体系完全改变了它整体的神学和学术取向。,"The times of the closed SVD anthropological school were coming to an end, and the SVD order has completely changed its overall theological and academic orientation since then."
5288,一开始介绍文化人类学研究，我们就将仔细考察该学科的性质。,"To introduce the study of cultural anthropology, we will look closely at the nature of the discipline."
5288,在第一章，我们将看到人类学领域是怎么划分的，各分支学科是如何相互联系的，以及它们与其他学科和人文学科的关系。,"In Chapter I we will see how the field of anthropology is subdivided, how the subdivisions relate to one another, and how they relate to the other sciences and humanities."
5288,在这之后，我们将把注意力转向文化——人类学的核心概念。,"Following this, we will turn our attention to the core concept of anthropology, culture."
5288,第二章讨论文化的性质及其对人类个体和社会的意义。,Chapter 2 will discuss the nature of culture and its significance for human individuals and societies.
5288,我们将以一章的篇幅结束本书第一编，我们要看一看，作为解决生存问題的人类机制，人类文化是如何发生的，如何对生物变迁取得优势的。,We will conclude this part of the textbook with a chapter that looks at how human culture originated and gained primacy over biological change as the human mechanism for solving the problems of existence.
5289,怀特去世后，他的学生们继承了他的这种进化论。,White’s style of evolutionism continued after his death through the work of his students.
5289,马歇尔• 萨林斯（特别是其早期著作）、埃尔曼•塞维斯以及马文• 哈里斯，还有许多其他学者，都将自身的知识理性归功于怀特。,"Marshall Sahlins (especially in his early work), Elman Service, and Marvin Harris, among many others, owe an intellectual debt to Leslie White."
5289,然而，随着文化生态学的出现，他们的观点比怀特更加细化，其研究也明显地趋向于更多途径。,"However, with the dawn of cultural ecology, their vision became more particularistic than White’s, and their approaches decidedly more multilinear."
5290,然而，社会学家着重研究在工业化的北美和欧洲社会生活的人，因而下述可能性就越来越大，即他们有关人类行为的理论是受文化束缚叫（culture bond）的，也就是说，他们关于世界和实在的假定以社会学家自己的西方文化那部分为根据。,"Sociologists, however, have concentrated heavily on studies of people living in modern—or at least recent—North American and European societies, thereby increasing the probability that their theories of human behavior will be culture bound: that is, based on assumptions about the world and reality that are part of the sociologists, Western culture, usually the middle-class version most typical of professional people."
5290,因为文化人类学家主要也是他们由以成长的文化的产物，所以他们从事理论活动也可能受到文化束缚。,"Since cultural anthropologists, too, are products of the culture they grew up with, they also are capable of culture-bound theorizing."
5290,然而，他们通过研究各个时代和各个地方的所有人，不断努力使偏见问题最小化，他们不使自己局限于当代西方民族的研究。人类学家已经发现，要充分理解人的观念和行为的复杂性，必须研究过去的和现在的所有的人。,"However, they constantly seek to minimize the problem by studying the whole of humanity in all times and places, and they do not limit themselves to the study of recent Western peoples; anthropologists have found that to fully understand human behavior, all humans, past and present, must be studied."
5291,博厄斯、罗维 、萨丕尔这些学者，特别是克虏伯（例如 Kroeber 1939 ) 帮助发展了文化区域概念。,"Of these, Boas, Lowie, Sapir, and especially Kroeber (e.g., 1939) helped to develop the notion of the culture area."
5291,"他们将他们的努力方向放在定义具体区域并记录“文化特质"" (culture traits) 上。文化特质是每个文化内部最小的文化单位。","They directed their efforts towards the definition of specific areas and the recording of ‘culture traits’, the minimal units of culture, within each."
5292,另一位受到马克思主义学派影响却又反对该学派新发展方向的美国人是马文•哈里斯（例如 Harris 1979: 216-57 )。,"Another American influenced by but opposed to new directions in Marxist anthropology, Marvin Harris (e.g."
5292,"他攻击结构马克思主义者过于偏向结构主义而不够唯物主义,并在此观点上建立了自己的理论。",", 1979: 216–57), built his attack on the notion that the structural Marxists were too structuralist and not materialist enough."
5292,"哈里斯的“文化唯物主义"" (cultural materialism) 被马克思主义学派重要学者乔纳森•弗里德曼 ( Friedman 1974 ) 批判为“庸俗的唯物主义”。哈里斯力求将文化归纳为几乎纯粹的物质力量。",Harris’ ‘cultural materialism’ – labelled ‘vulgar materialism’ in an important Marxist attack by Jonathan Friedman (1974) – sought to reduce culture to virtually pure material forces.
5293,古典文化相对论产生于弗朗兹•博厄斯及其学生的著作中。,Classic cultural relativism emerged from the work of Franz Boas and his students.
5293,在20世纪上半叶，它一直是美国人类学研究的首要范式。,For the first half of the twentieth century it was the dominant paradigm of American anthropology.
5293,"一些古典文化相对论的拥护者（包括博厄斯本人）强调文化的丰富性，而在当时人们普遍认为文化是“原始的"" (primitive) ;  其中有儿位拥护者（也包括博厄斯）用相对论来反对种族主义、犹太主义和民族狂热；","Some adherents (including Boas himself) stressed the richness of cultures then generally thought of as ‘primitive’, and several (again including Boas) used relativist ideology to argue the case against racism, anti-Semitism, and nationalist zealotry."
5294,因此，19世纪欧洲人和美国白人只不过表现出他们自己的种族中心主义罢了。,
5294,自人类学家开始生活在所谓野蛮民族之中并发现他们与任何人一样以后，他们就一直积极地参与同种族中心主义的斗争。,
5294,因此，人类学家开始根据文化自身的条件考察每一种文化，探讨文化是否满足人们自己的需要和期望 问题。例如，一个民族实行人祭，他们就问，根据当地人的准则，夺人生命是否可以接受。,"As a consequence, anthropologists began to examine each culture on its own terms, asking whether or not the culture satisfied its people's needs and expectations.If a people practiced human sacrifice, for example, anthropologists asked about the circumstances that made the taking of human life acceptable according to native values."
5294,为了根据其他民族自己的文化条件来理解它们，一个人必须中止对其他民族习恪的判断，这一观念被称为文化相对主义（cultural relativism）。,The idea that one must suspend judgment on other peoples' practices in order to understand them in their own cultural terms is called cultural relativism.
5294,只有通过这种研究方式，人们才能获得关于其他民族习俗的未扭曲的观点，也能获得对人们自己社会的洞力。,"Only through such an approach can one gain an undistorted view of another people's ways, as well as insights into the practices of one's own society."
5295,面对普遍化和全球化，人类学具有可能除了历史学外其他学科所不具备的力量去理解独特性、地方性的重要意义。,"It has strengths unparalleled by other traditional fields of study, except perhaps history, in that it understands the importance of the particular, and thus the local, over against the universalist and the global."
5295,人类学保持着对相互关联的价值观念和实践体系的敏感，在文化背景中关注特定的生活方式。,Anthropologists contextualize specific lifeways by keeping intact the systems of values and practice to which each is tied.
5295,严谨的人类学家并非总是发布全球化普适主义扫荡的言论。,"Careful anthropologists do not usually go around making global, universalist sweeping statements."
5295,人类学的文化相对主义已受到来自认为人性是普遍的现代性模型的支持者们的攻击（Hollis and Lukes 1982），而另一方面又得到持较为人文观点的人们的赞赏（MacIntyre 1985；Taylor 1985）。,"The cultural relativism of anthropology has been subjected to major attack by all those defensive defenders of universalist modernist models of human nature (cf. Hollis and Lukes 1982), and conversely praised by defenders of more humanist, perspectival concerns (MacIntyre 1985; Taylor 1985)."
5296,少数社会学家看到了杜尔克姆所谈论的是文化特质及其表现，而不是人类有机体及其互动。但是，他的大多数后继者不是试图将他的文化学转变为人类互动的社会心理学，就是把它误解为“神秘主义”。,"A few sociologists have been able to see that Durlcheim is talking about culture traits and their behavior rather than human organisms and their interactions, but most of his successors have either tried to reduce his culturology to the social psychology of interaction or have dismissed it as ""mysticism""."
5296,然而，尽管存在着对他的误解，杜尔克姆的影响仍是巨大的，他最终将被公认为文化科学的奠基人之一。,"Despite misunderstanding, however, Durkheim's influence has been considerable, and he will eventually come to be recognized as one of the founders of the science of culture."
5297,所有的事物都是相对的。田野民族志中没有真理。,Everything is relative; there is no truth in ethnography.
5297,人类学家应该融入文学批评领域，或最好归入承担了人类学中一大块的研究对象的那类文学批评——文化研究（参见例如 Bratlinger 1990) 。,"Anthropology should dissolve into literary criticism, or at best into that brand of literary criticism that has taken over a big piece of anthropology’s subject matter – cultural studies (see, e.g., Bratlinger 1990)."
5298,文化变迁包括创新、传播、文化遗失和涵化。,"The mechanisms involved in cultural change are innovation, diffusion, cultural loss, and acculturation."
5298,变迁的最终来源是通过创新：一些新的做法、工具或原理。,"The ultimate source of change is innovation: a new practice, tool, or principle."
5298,其他个人接受这一创新，于是它就变成社会分享的了。,"Other individuals adopt the innovation, and it becomes socially shared."
5298,首次创新是对一些新原理的偶然发现——例如黏士经火焙烧能够变得永久坚硬这一发现。,"Primary innovations are chance discoveries of new principles—for example, the discovery that the firing of clay makes the material permanently hard."
5298,二次创新是通过对已知原理的应用而带来的改进——例如，用已知的技术将黏土烧铸成人们所熟悉的物体。,"Secondary innovations are improvements made by applying known principles—for example, modeling the clay to be fired by known techniques into familiar objects."
5298,首次创新可以促进快速的文化变迁，并激发其他发明。,Primary innovations may prompt rapid cultural change and stimulate other inventions.
5298,一种创新被接受的机会，部分地（而非全部地）取决于它相对于自己将要取代的那种方法或物体的明显可见的优越性。,"An innovation's chance of acceptance depends partly, but not entirely, on its perceived superiority to the method or object it replaces."
5299,相对论人类学的第一个伟大人物是Franz博厄斯， 他的主张基本属于描写性相对论。,"The first great relativist in anthropology was Franz Boas, whose ideas were essentially of the descriptive relativist type."
5299,业余语言学家本杰明•李•沃尔夫是博厄斯的追随者，估奉一种认知相对论，以后的认知人类学者和民族科学家也是一样。,"His follower, amateur linguist Benjamin Lee Whorf, embraced a form of cognitive relativism, as did later cognitive anthropologists and ethnoscientists."
5299,早期的“文化与人格”学派的心理人类学与道德相对论有特定的联系。,Early psychological anthropology of the ‘culture and personality’ school was characteristically associated with moral relativism.
5300,"卢梭所说的“最初社会"" ( socie ́te  naissante )  是一个黄金时代，但是对于大多数人来说，该时代并没有持续很久。","Rousseau’s ‘nascent society’ (socie ́te ́ naissante) was a golden age, but for most of humankind it did not last."
5300,嫉妒出现了，私有财产的出现导致财富积累，并因此出现了人们之间的财富争夺。,"Jealousies emerged, and the invention of private property caused the accumulation of wealth and consequent disputes between people over that wealth."
5300,文明，或说“ 文明社会” 就以这样不平等日益加剧的方式发展。,"Civilization, or ‘civil society’ developed in such a way that inequalities increased."
5301,从某种程度上来说，这些情况延续了早期唯物主义和心智主义之间的分歧，但是现在，这种分歧表现为政治经济学与解释人类学相对立的形式，后者导致了一种文本人文主义的诞生。,"To some extent these continued the earlier division between materialists and mentalists, but now the division took the form of political economy as against interpretive anthropology, with the latter giving rise to a textual humanism."
5301,这一分歧可以从赋予“批评的”（critical)这一术语的不同意义中略见一斑。,The divergence may be seen in the different meanings attached to the term critical.
5301,双方都将这一称号据为己有：对一方而言，其所指涉的批评（critique)是政治上的；而对另一方而 言，这一模式指的是文学批评（literary criticism)。,"Both sides claimed that label: for one side, the critique it referred to was political; for the other side the model was literary criticism."
5301,在1970年代 至1980年代期间，双方之间变得越来越对立，但没有哪一方是一成不变的：每一方都涵盖了一系列的理论观点和政治立场，而且在数十年的进程中也都历经了变迁。,"During the 1970s and 1980s the sides grew more antagonistic to each other, but neither one was monolithic: each covered a range of theoretica and political positions, and each side underwent change over the course of these decades."
5302,18世纪时，支配模式是围绕着乌托邦主义这一关键概念的“作为寓言的民族志”，其中“高贵的野蛮人”作为一种治疗者的形象，扮演着使人高贵（ennobling)的角色。,"In the eighteenth century, the dominant mode was ""ethnography as allegory,"" centering around the key concept of utopianism in which the ""noble savage"" played his ennobling role as a therapeutic image."
5302,19世纪时，“野蛮人”不再高贵；她或者是持久不衰的圣经寓言中的“堕落的”形象，或者是治疗性讽刺故事中的形象一一一根起威吓作用的魔鬼的手指，或是最初的“原始”的例子，在新出现的进化论寓言中标志着过去的不完美性被时间所治愈的“活化石”。,"In the nineteenth century, the ""savage"" was no longer noble; she was either ""fallen,"" in the continuing biblical allegory, or a figure of therapeutic irony — a minatory Satanic finger, or an instance of the primordial ""primitive,"" a ""living fossil"" signifying past imperfection healed by time in the emerging evolutionary allegory."
5302,20世纪时，“野蛮人”甚至不再是“原始的”。,"In the twentieth century, the ""savage"" was no longer even ""primitive."""
5303,在这样的社会中，群体（社区和氏族）拥有我们如今很难想象的权力。,"In such societies, the group – the community and clan – has power difficult for us to imagine."
5303,最引人注目的事例最易被引用。,The dramatic instances are easiest to cite.
5303,例如，在“巫毒教（voodoo) 死亡”中，如果群体宣称一个人死了，他就死了。,"In ""voodoo death"", for example, if the group declares a person dead, he dies."
5303,相反，在治愈仪式中，如果群体宣称一个人好了，他就好了。,"Conversely, in rituals of healing, if the group declares a person well, he gets well."
5303,在这里，个体意识是如此深陷于群体意识中，以至于谈论像我们所知道的个体主义是不准确的。,Here individual consciousness is so deeply enmeshed with group consciousness that it is not accurate to speak of individualism as we know it.
5304,的确，自20世纪60年代以来，巫技在美国开始经历某种程度的繁荣，并不只有北美人才相信巫技。,"Although many North Americans suppose witchcraft is something that belongs to a less enlightened past, in fact, it is alive and well in the United States today.Indeed, starting in the 1960s, witchcraft began to undergo something of a boom in this country."
5304,例如，虽然尼日利亚的伊比比奥人已经接受了越来越多的现代教育和科学训练，但他们在解释不幸事件时，对巫术的依赖性却增强了此外，经常是伊比比奥社会中受过较多教育的年轻人指控别人对自己施巫术。,"North Americans are by no means alone in this; for example, as the Ibibio of Nigeria have become increasingly exposed to modern education and scientific training, their reliance on witchcraft as an explanation for misfortune has increased.Furthermore, it is often the younger, more educated members of Ibibio society who accuse others of bewitching them."
5304,而受到指控的通常是社会中更年老和更传统的成员；因此，我们有一种代际敌意的表现方式，这种敌意往往存在于快速变迁的社会之中。,"Frequently, the accused are the older, more traditional members of society; thus we have an expression of the intergenerational hostility that often exists in fast-changing traditional societies."
5304,尽管很多北美人相信，巫技只属于未开化 的过去时代的东西，但事实上，在今天的美国它依然存在，而且很兴盛。,
5305,“无家可归者（the unhomely)”是霍米·巴哈巴哈（Homi Bhabha) 创造的词，用来概括那些“没有家的人”——难民、移民、被殖民者、解放的奴隶、妇女和同性恋者——的困境，这些人“在系统内”是没有家的。,"""The unhomely"" is a Homi Bhabha turn of phrase (1994) which he employs to highlight the plight of ""unhomeliness"" of all those people—refugees, migrants, the colonized, ex-slaves, women, gays—who have no home within ""the system""."
5305,今天，世界上大多数土著居民都被划到了这个范围里。,"Today, most indigenous peoples of the world also belong to this category."
5305,作为一种建构，它被用来指一种“混合”的状态（既不在这儿，也不在那儿），同时也适用于后殖民的争论。,"As a construct it refers to the state of ""hybridity"" (being neither here nor there), and as such is situated within post-colonial debate."
5306,经验告诉人们，他们所自鸣得意地对之抱有幻想的无限权力，始终是他的弱点的一个根源。他对事物的控制权，只有当他承认事物有其自己的本性，并使自已甘心情愿地了解这一本性时，才真正地产生出来，然而，这种反复重现的经验却为人视而不见。,"In vain have repeated experiences taught him that this omnipotence, the illusion of which he complacently entertains, has always been a cause of weakness in him; that his power over things really began only when he recognized that they have a nature of their own, and resigned himself to learning this nature from them."
5306,为其他科学所摒弃的上述可悲的偏见，却牢牢地盘踞在社会学[文化学]之中。,"Rejected by all other sciences, this deplorable prejudice stubbornly maintains itself in sociology [culturology]."
5306,再也没有比把我们的科学从这种偏见中解脱出来更为紧迫的任务了，而这正是我们努力所欲达到的目的。,"Nothing is more urgent than to liberate our science from it, and this is the principal purpose of our efforts."
5307,无言贸易（silent trade）是不进行口头交流的物物交换的一种特殊形式。,Silent trade is a specialized form of barter with no verbal communication.
5307,其实，它可能根本没有面对面的接触。,"In fact, it may involve no actual face-to-face contact at all."
5307,这种情况经常是寻食民族与其生产食物的邻居之间交易的特征，因为在过去大约2000年的时间里前者已提供世界经济所需的各种各样的商品。,"Such cases often have characterized the dealings between foodforaging peoples and their food-producing neighbors, as the former have supplied for the past 2000 years various commodities in demand by the world economy."
5308,但是，他指出，这并不意味着我们应当追求一种统一的波普尔式的真理王国，而是像保罗˙费耶阿本德(Paul Feyembend)那样，我们应尽可能开放地让我们的选择接受探询。,"But, he argues, this does not imply that we should search for a unified Popperian realm of the true; rather, a la Paul Feyerabend, we should keep our options in inquiry as open as possible."
5308,哈金提醒我们，古希腊人没有统计学的槪念，并且从未使用过统计方法，这一事实既未使古希腊科学、也未使统计学失去其价值。,"The Greeks, Hacking reminds us, h a d no concept, or use, of statistics, a fact that invalidates neither Greek science nor statistics as such."
5308,这一立场并不是相对主义的，但也不是经验主义的。,"This position is not relativism, but it is not imperialism either."
5308,"罗蒂将他眼中的这一切命名为解释学，哈金则称其为“无政府的理性主义""（Anarcho-rationalism)。",Rorty calls his version of all this hermeneutics.Hacking calls his anarcho-rationalism.
5308,无政府的理性主义是把“对他人的宽容与自身的真理和理性标准相结合”（第65页）。,"""Anarcho-rationalism is tolerance for other people combined with the discipline of one's own standards o f truth and reason"" (65)."
5308,在此，让我们将其称为良善的科学。,Let us call it good science.
5309,宗教的程序远不是理性的和解释性的行为，也不是以试验定理或对理性构想的假设的验证为基础的。,"The procedure is far from being intellectual or explanatory activity, based on experimental propositions or the testing of rationally formulated hypotheses."
5309,宗教根本就不是基于一个机械论的宇宙，就宗教信仰对待经验事实、原因和功能的态度来说（在努尔人中，乱伦导致麻风病），这些对它们的目标都是第二位的，并且是被直觉地诗意地获得的，完全没有通过理论或试验的中介。,"Religion is not grounded in a mechanistic universe at all, and to the extent that religious beliefs treat empirical facts, causes and functions (""among the Nuer, incest causes leprosy""), then these are secondary to their main purpose, and arrived at intuitively or poetically, and without theoretical or experimental mediation."
5309,更确切地说，宗教仪式和信仰的主要目标是，通过诅咒、牺牲和祈祷去影响一个充满人格化的现实的有目的的宇宙。,"The main purpose of religious ritual and belief is, rather, to influence, by imprecation, sacrifice and prayer, an intentioning universe replete with personalized beings."
5310,"在20世纪50年代以前，虽然“肢体语言”很少得到科学的关注，但自那时起, 特别在北美人那里有许多研宄。","Although little scientific notice was taken of body language prior to the 1950s, since then a great deal of research, particularly among North Americans, has occurred."
5310,然而，跨文化研究已经表明，全世界在诸如微笑、 笑、哭，以及愤怒的面部表情等基本面部表情方面有许多相似之处。,"Cross-cultural research has shown, however, many similarities around the world for such basic facial expressions as smiling, laughing, crying, and variations of anger."
5310,我们从灵长目动物祖先那里遗传来的这种得意的笑、皱眉等等，很少需要学习，而且比习惯的姿势更难“伪装”。,"Such smirks, frowns, and so forth that we have inherited from our primate ancestry require little learning and are harder to fake than conventional gestures."
5310,全世界在远距离打招呼的惯例方面都很相似。,"Great similarity, too, exists around the world in the routine for greeting over a distance."
5311,社会结构并非自成一格，也不是靠惯性存在，而是有赖于各个个体持续的有意识的协调行动来进行延伸、生长和维系（Holy and Stuchlik 1981; 15-16）。,"Social structure, here, is not sui generis, and does not exist through inertia; it depends on the continuing, conscious, concerted activity of different individuals to intend, produce and sustain it (cf. Holy and Stuchlik 1981:15–16)."
5311,而且社会结构并非总是导致一致性、稳定性、连续性或者协调。,"Furthermore, social structure does not inexorably give rise to homogeneity, stability, consistency or communication."
5311,作为散漫的俗语和一种编造，它总是创造性解释的主题，个体操纵和再演绎的对象，改变文化的行动的靶心（Handler and Segal 1990: 87）.,"As a discursive idiom, a fiction, it is always subject to creative interpretation, to individualmanipulation and re-rendering, to ‘alter-cultural action’ (Handler and Segal 1990:87)."
5311,人类学已经开始以这种方式更加致力于弥合民族志描述中习俗与创造、社会结构与个体能动性之间的间隙。,"In this way, anthropology has begun more concertedly to fill in the gaps in the ethnographic record of relations between convention and creativity, social structure and individual agency."
5312,"这些人中最著名的无疑要数詹姆斯·乔治·弗雷泽爵士（James George Frazer, 1854-1941）。作为一位正统派学者，弗雷泽在三一学院和剑桥拥有教职，终其一生都在编纂和精简他那部研究巫术和宗教的13卷本《金枝》。这一时期的英国人类学作品有许多共同的特征。","The most famous of them all was no doubt Sir James George Frazer (1854–1941), a classical scholar who held a fellowship at Trinity College, Cambridge, and spent his life compiling and abridging his thirteen-volume study of magic and religion named The Golden Bough.The work of this period in British anthropology has a number of shared features."
5312,它们全部都是以现成的文字材料而非直接的田野观察为基础，遵照研究经典和历史的学者所设定下的模式。,"It is all based on written sources, not direct field observation, conforming to the pattern set by the scholars of classics and history."
5313,就如在入类种群中常见的那样，这些旧石器时代晚期民族（Upper Paleolithic Peoples）也显出身体方面相当大的差异，但是，一般说来，他们都具有独特的现代人模样的面部。,"As is usual in human populations, these Upper Paleolithic peoples reveal considerable physical variability, but, generally speaking, they all had characteristically modern-looking faces."
5313,就如我们在讨论直立人时指出的那样，专门的工具和烹饪，通过逐步承担曾经由大的牙齿和有力的颌担当的咀嚼和软化功能，有助于达到这种现代化。,"As suggested in our discussion of Homo erectus, specialized tools and cooking helped achieve this modernization by gradually assuming the chewing and softening functions once served by large teeth and heavy jaws."
5313,"自然选择看来已有助于咀嚼肌的减少,因而这些肌肉附着其上的骨头也变得不太大了。","Selection seems to have favored diminished muscles for chewing, and consequently the bones these muscles were attached to became less massive."
5314,当人类学家从不同的角度对现代化理论提出批评时，一个主要的替代理论却来自人类学之外，它由经济学家安德烈˙冈德˙弗兰克（Andre Gunder Frank)提出。,"While anthropologists were offering critiques of modernization theory from a variety of perspectives, a major alternative came from outside of anthropology, from the economist Andre Gunder Frank."
5314,其观点的前身可以在早期的马克思主义文献以及冈纳˙米达尔（Gunnar Myrdal)和一些拉美发展经济学家的著作中觅得端愧，但依附理论（dependency theory)仍然主要是通过弗兰克进入到人类学中的。,"His ideas had precursors in the earlier Marxist literature and in the writings of Gunnar Myrdal and some Latin American development economists, but it was mainly through Frank that dependency theory entered anthropology."
5314,根据他的“不发达的发展”（the development of underdevelopment)概念，弗兰克指出从不发达到发展并不是一个线性序列，相反，它们是一个硬币的正反两面，是资本主义内部矛盾的表现形式（Frank 1966，1967)。,"With his notion of ""the development of underdevelopment,"" Frank argued that there was not a linear sequence from underdevelopment to development; rather, these were opposite sides of the same coin, manifestations of internal contradictions of capitalism (Frank 1966, 1967)."
5315,另一方面，安东尼的话意在说明他是反创造论者。,"What Anthony is saying, on the other hand, is that he is anticreationist."
5315,他相信我们有太多的肚脐，而且它们绝对必要。,He believes that we have this plethora of navels and that they are absolutely essential.
5315,他说，现代主义只讲述了一半故事，我想这是我与他之间分歧的症结所在。,He says – and I think this is the crux of the disagreement between us – that modernism only tells half the story.
5315,但是，即便现代主义只讲述了一半故事，与我而言也足矣。,"But if it tells half the story, that is enough for me."
5316,我们看到人类学的现实主义并非纯粹的价值无涉，不过是一种相当独特的色彩性很强表达方式。,"We see then that anthropological realism is not an innocent, value-free task, for it is a highly coloured presentation of a very specific kind."
5316,作为对“关于他者的事实”的创造而非表达，它有着自己的“现实影响力”（Mason 1990)。,"As such it is a creation of ""the reality of the other"", and not a representation; as a creation it has its own ""reality effect"" (cf. Mason 1990)."
5316,这种表达方式和其他人文学科在试图与自然科学匹配中所创造的对他者的想象世界一样取得自身的位置并获得特定的权力。,Such presentations acquire their special signifying power by taking their place within a network of other imaginary worlds also created in the modernist spirit by the rest of the human sciences as they made their fit with the natural sciences.
5317,他们很少说明这里所说的“复杂性”意谓着什么，更不曾试图证明现象的复杂性势必意味着科学成就的不足。,"They seldom explain what they mean by ""complexity,"" and more rarely do they attempt to prove that complexity of phenomena must mean meagerness of scientific achievement."
5317,他们仅仅假设，首先，人人都通晓复杂性的含义；其次，他们设想，复杂性无可争辩地意谓着困难。,"They merely assume, in the first place, that everyone knows what is meant by complexity, and,in the second place, they assume without argument that complexity means difEculty."
5317,我们认为这样的推论是毫无根据的。,We regard their reasoning as unsound.
5317,在“难以科学地探讨”的意义上，社会现象并不比物理现象和生理现象更为复杂。,"Social phenomena arc no more complex in the sense of ""difficult to treat scientifically"" than physical or physiological phenomena."
5318,然而当我用受访者的语言同他们交谈的时候（刚开始的时候这对我而言是极为困难的），一种被巴塞尔˙伯恩斯坦（Basil Bernstein）称作话语的“限制性符码”（restricted code of discourse）的规则便显著地表现出来。,"But when I conversed with informants in their own tongue (however ineptly, at first, on my part), there prevailed the conventions of what Basil Bernstein has called a ""restricted code"" of discourse."
5318,文化以及社会结构的很多前提和属性都被省略，和受访者使用同样的语言看来意味着对这种文化的价值观念和信仰的认同。,Many premises and features of culture and social structure were left unstated; use of a common language implied a consensus as to values and beliefs.
5318,如此一来，受访者似乎也就忽略了交谈的双方是否具有共同的经验、动机以及情感等因素了。,"Shared experience, motives, and feelings were also taken for granted."
5318,借助翻译的访谈迫使受访者在谈论他们的习俗和信仰之前必须三思而后行，更确切地说，类似的情形迫使受访者意识到了规则的存在，而在此之前他们可能仅仅隐约感觉到自己的谈话是否恰当。,"The translation situation forced informants to think carefully before they spoke about their customs and beliefs and, indeed, compelled them to become aware of principle and regularity where before there was merely an obscure sense of fitness."
5319,乡村牧歌的概念关注的是在城市势不可挡的发展的社会文化背景下，“乡村”所具有的某些意义和价值。,"The concept of the rural idyll concerns the way that ""the rural"" possesses a certain meaning and value in socio-cultural milieux which are overwhelmingly urban."
5319,它是关于人们在多大程度上根据自己声称的“乡村性”或“城市性”来斟酌自己的身份和使自己的生活风格有意义，尤其是“乡村”如何成为了更自然、完整和和谐的生活方式的宝库（Strathern 1982)。,"It pertains to the extent to which people measure their identities and make sense of their lifestyles in terms of their purported ""rurality"" or ""urbanity"", and, in particular, how ""the rural"" comes to be a repository for ways of life which are regarded as more natural, holistic and harmonious (cf. Strathern 1982)."
5319,人类学家和他们对乡村共同体及共产主义的描述也以这祥的方式受到了 “乡村”概念的影响。,Among those affected in this way by notions of the rural can be included anthropologists and their depictions of village communities and of communitarianism.
5320,贝尔诺随后参与了在列维-斯特劳斯的支持下进行的一项对一个法国北部乡村社区的初期人类学研究（Bernot and Blancard 1953）。,Bernot then participated in an early anthropological study of a northern French rural community under the auspices of Lévi-Strauss (Bernot and Blancard 1953).
5320,"1951-1952年间，他在马尔马人（Marma）中做田野研究。这是一个讲藏缅语并生活在当时还属于东巴基斯坦（现在是孟加拉国）吉大港地区的族群。他在1970年代把这次调查扩展到了对缅甸的研究（Bernot and Bernot 1958；Bernot 1967a,1967b）。","In 1951-1952 he was with the Marma, a Tibeto-Burmesespeaking group in the Chittagong area of what was then East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), which he extended into a study of Burma in the 1970s (see Bernot and Bernot 1958; Bernot 1967a，1967b)."
5321,有点战战兢兢地编出这样一本有争议的论文集，希望它得到严肃的对待，面不是简单的反对，比如，说它是对科学的又一次攻击抑是或相对主义的煽动。,"One launches a controversial collection like this with some trepidation, hoping it will be seriously engaged — not simply rejected, for example, as another attack on science or an incitement to relativism."
5321,诸如这样的反对意见至少应该说清楚，为什么对于民族志学者所做的主要事情——这就是写作一一的切近分析，不应该在对科学研究结果的评估中占据核心地位，本书中的作者没人认为任何文化描述都一样好坏。,"Rejections of this kind should at least make clear why close analysis of one of the principal things ethnographers do — that is, write — should not be central to evaluation of the results of scientific research.The authors in this volume do not suggest that one cultural account is as good as any other."
5321,如果他们支持一种如此无足轻重和自我拆台的相对主义，他们就不会投入那么多精力冒着惹麻烦的风险写那么详尽的、批判性文章了。,"If they espoused so trivial and self-refuting a relativism, they would not have gone to the trouble of writing detailed, committed, critical studies."
5322,相异性这一概念只是在20世纪90年代以来才在人类学的词汇中获得重要的位置。,"The concept of alterity has only recently, in the 1990s, acquired an important place within the vocabulary of anthropology."
5322,“他者”的概念作为人类学的主要关怀被广泛接受，导致过去二十年中众多作品深深卷入对那些冠名为“某种主义”的现代思想（进化主义、功能主义、结构主义如此等等）的批判，这些现代思想曾经代表着西方文明中的帝国主义和资本主义。,"This more general acceptance of the notion of ‘otherness’ as a major concern for anthropological consideration comes in the wake of innumerable writings over the past two decades that have been seriously engaged in a critique of all those grand ‘isms’ of modernist thought (evolutionism, functionalism, structuralism, and so forth) that are implicated in Western civilization’s imperialist and capitalist past."
5322,这一思潮的显著特点是总在模糊哲学、社会学、人类学和历史学这些学科之间的界限。,"A striking characteristic of this literature is that it consistently blurs the boundaries normally held between such disciplines as philosophy, sociology, anthropology, history."
5322,例如“社会学家”鲍曼（Zygmunt Bauman）的著作涉及人文学科中的众多相邻领域，也涉及文学和文化研究。,"For instance, the writings of Zygmunt Bauman, a ‘sociologist’, are relevant to all the neighbouring fields of study within the human sciences, and also those of literary and cultural studies."
5322,跨学科的两个志趣和突出的特征是：（1）除非谁完全了解内情，否则往往很难指出一个学者归属哪个学科；（2）社会科学和人文学科间传统的学科界限基本上正在消融。,"Two very interesting and significant results of such crossing of disciplinary boundaries are that (1) unless one is ‘in the know’ it is often very difficult to pinpoint the author’s disciplinary attachment, and (2) the traditional boundaries between the social sciences and the humanities are being systematically dissolved."
5322,造成后者的原因源于近来关于“相异性”的讨论，换句话说，关于相异的客观化的他者的概念和比较，已经动摇了对人文学科及其所声称的科学权威和客观性的固有信任的基础。,"The reason for the latter is that the primary resolve of this recent talk about ‘alterity’—about, in other words, the concept and treatment of the alien objectified other—is to shake the foundation of the objectifying thrust of the human sciences, along with all its claims of scientific authority and objectivity."
5323,而且图恩瓦尔德在一些人的学术晋升方面起到了很大作用，如英格堡·赛多（Ingeborg Sydow）和伊娃·尤斯廷，这些人积极地帮助——正如在后者的论文中反映的——将集中营里的罗马人、辛迪人和犹太人推向死亡。然而，图恩瓦尔德成为德语国家所有人类学家中最著名的一位并非偶然。,"Moreover, Thurnwald substantially contributed to the academic promotion of some persons, like Ingeborg Sydow and Eva Justin, who actively helped—as was reflected in the latter’s thesis—to send Roma, Sinti, and Jews to death in concentration camps.Yet it is no coincidence that Thurnwald stands out as one of the best known anthropologists of all time from the German-speaking countries."
5323,有鉴于他那极富争议的一生所固有的象征意义，他的这种特殊地位仍然还要维持一段时间也许倒是个好事。,"Perhaps it is good that this will remain so for a while to come, given the inherent symbolism of his profoundly contradictory biography."
5324,在出神的第三个也是最深的阶段，主体不再是他们的幻觉的观察者，而倒像是这些幻觉的一部分了。,"In the third and deepest trance stage, subjects cease to be observers of their hallucinations but seem to become part of them."
5324,当这种情况发生的时候，他们感到自己正在经过一个旋转的隧道或者一个有着格子状侧壁的旋涡，在那上面浮现出动物、人和各种怪物的形象。,"As this happens, they feel themselves passing into a rotating tunnel or vortex with latticelike sides and on which appear images of animals, humans, and monsters of various sorts."
5324,在这一过程中，早期阶段产生的各种内视形式被整合进了这些所谓的肖像意象（iconicimages）之中。,"In the process, the entoptic forms of the earlier stages become integrated into these iconic images, as they are called."
5324,内视图案离开主要的意象就很难被看出来，尽管有时候它们看起来像是一种背景。,"The entoptics may be hard to discern apart from the main image, although sometimes they appear as a kind of background."
5324,肖像意象是因文化而异的，个体看见的是他们的文化 让他们看见的东西，这些意象往往含有很强的情绪性内容。,"Iconic images are culture specific； individuals ""see"" what their culture disposes them to see; often these images have high emotional content."
5325,特罗布里恩德人是园艺农业者，他们的主食是山药（一种富含碳水化合物的块茎植物）。,The Trobrianders are horticulturalists and the staple food is the yam (a tuber rich in carbohydrates).
5325,但每个家户耕种的首要目的并非用于个人消费，实际上却是为了他们的母系亲戚而种植山药。,"However, each household does not primarily cultivate yams for its own consumption.Rather, they grow yams for their matrilineal relatives."
5325,一个男人和他的家户因此是为了他的姐妹而种山药（女人也会在园子里种些日常所需的山药，这些园地是为此目的而留下的），岛民也把山药给其他亲戚。一个男人可能会对那些由其妻子的兄弟给予他的妻子的山药进行再分配。,"A man and his household thus grow yams for the man's sister.(Women also grow some yams for daily consumption in gardens allocated to this purpose.)The islanders also give yams to other relatives, and a man may redistribute yams given to his wife by her brothers."
5326,消极互惠（negative reciprocity）是交换的第三种形式。在消极互惠中赠与人试图在交易中胜出。,"Negative reciprocity is a third form of reciprocity exchange, in which the giver tries to get the better end of the deal."
5326,交易双方有着对立的利益，通常是不同社区的成员，而且关系不太密切。,"The parties involved have opposing interests, usually are members of different communities, and are not closely related."
5326,消极互惠的极端形式是用暴力把东西抢走。,The ultimate form of negative reciprocity is to take something by force.
5326,不太极端的形式包括欺诈、诈骗或至少拼命讨价还价。,"Less extreme forms involve guile and deception or, at the least, hard bargaining."
5326,在美国，一个例子也许是对汽车销售员的一种刻板印象：他声称那辆汽车“是老小姐上教堂驾驶的”，而事实并非如此，或许在它拍卖出去后不久，问题就逐渐显露出来了。,"In the United States, an example would be the stereotype of the car salesperson who claims a car was ""driven by a little old lady to church"" when in fact it was not and is likely to develop problems soon after it leaves the sales lot."
5326,据人类学家克莱德·克拉克洪的报道，在美国西南部的纳瓦霍人中，“在与外来人交易时，从伦理角度上说，欺骗是为公众所接受的。”,"Among the Navajo, according to anthropologist Clyde Kluck- hohn, ""to deceive when trading with foreign peoples is morally accepted""."
5327,先秦巴蜀地区各族，除巴、蜀两族外，主要为百濮和氐羌两大民族系统。巴蜀地区的百濮，多为商周时代即已在当地定居的族群，也有春秋时代从江汉地区迁徙而来的濮人支系，主要分布在四川盆地、四川西南和四川东部。,"Baipu and Diqiang were the main ethnic groups in the BaShu region in the Pre-Qin period besides the Ba and Shu nationalities.Most of the Baipu ethnic group had settled in the BaShu region in the Shang and Zhou dynasties, but a small party migrated there during the Spring and Autumn period and were distributed mainly in the Sichuan Basin, Southwest Sichuan and East Sichuan."
5327,巴蜀地区的氐羌民族系统至少在夏商时代就已出现，主要分布在川西高原。,"Main party of the Diqiang ethnic groups were distributed in the West Sichuan Plateau, who had appeared in BaShu as early as the Xia and the Shang dynasty."
5328,拜树节是仡佬族民间传统节日，流行于广西隆林等地。,"Baishu Festival is a Gelao traditional folk festival that is in particular prevalent in Longlin,Guangxi province."
5328,"拜树节这天家家户户带上酒、肉、糯米饭、鞭炮，轮流向房前屋后及山上的树木举行仪式，预祝林木旺盛，果树丰收，并刨掉树根周围的野草，选远山上一棵高大的树作""代表""去拜。","On this day every household takes out wine, meat, rice, and firecrackers, and the family members take turns to conduct specific rituals towards the trees in front of and and behind their house.They wish the trees to grow stronger in hope of a fruit harvest, and they remove the weeds around the roots of these trees.They also choose to worship a tall tree on a distant hillside."
5328,拜树节后全寨就自发地进行造林活动，形成习俗，成了绿树造林的一个好传统。,"After the Baishu Festival, they spontaneously carry out afforestation activities, which has become a good tradition of planting trees."
5329,根据所提出的界定礼器的标准，认为山东龙山文化时期已经形成了一套礼器组合——以黑陶器物群为主、包括白陶鬶在内的陶礼器，由玉冠饰、玉钺、玉锛等玉器组合而成的玉礼器及少量的乐礼器。,"：According to the standard for ritual vessels, a combination of ritual vessel had been formulated during Shandong Longshan Culture, which included the pottery ritual vessels featuring black potteries and white pottery Gui, and the jade ritual vessels featuring jade crown jewel, jade tomahawk, jade adz,as well as the ritual vessels for playing music."
5329,以此为基础，对山东龙山文化礼器的总体特征、承继关系、传播影响及发展演变等问题作进一步探讨，对山东龙山文化礼器的艺术特点及对后世艺术的影响作综合分析，对山东龙山文化礼器与文明起源的关系问题进行研究。,"On the basis of this research, this article discussed about the overall characteristic, inheritance, evolution and influence of the ritual vessels that belonged to the Shandong Longshan Culture.Besides, this article makes an analysis about the artistic characteristics of the ritual vessels of Shandong Longshan Culture.Finally, this article discusses the relationship between the ritual vessels of Shandong Longshan Culture and the origin of the civilization."
5329,通过研究山东龙山文化礼器，为海岱地区及其它地区新石器时代礼器乃至整个新石器时代礼器的发展历程提供一套系统的研究模式。,"The main purpose of this article is to provide a systematic model for the research on the development of ritual vessels of Haidai region and other regions of the Neolithic Age, by researching the ritual vessels of Shandong Longshan Culture."
5330,关于春秋时代晋县的性质，学术界多认为是卿大夫的采邑。,Lots of scholars regard counties of Jin in the Spring and Autumn Period as the feuds of the ministers and high officials.
5330,但从晋县主官不世袭和赋税受国家支配等情况来看，晋县当为国君的直属地。,"However, according to the facts that the position of major officials couldn't be inherited and the taxes were dominated by the country, counties of Jin should be the territories directly subordinate to the emperor."
5330,至于对卿大夫赏与县，是指委任其做县大夫，并非所谓的授以为采。,The county rewarded to ministers and high officials didn't represent the feud but rather the appointment of senior
5331,20世纪国内藏戏研究可分为两个阶段。第一阶段是1930～1970年代末，可视为国内藏戏研究的初发期；第二阶段是1980～1990年代，可视为国内藏戏研究的兴盛期。,"Studies on Tibetan opera in the 20th century in our country can be divided into two stages: the first stage is from 1930s till late 1970s, which can be regarded as the incipient period."
5331,,"The second stage is the era from 1980s to 1990s, which can be regarded as the flourishing period."
5331,与前一阶段相比，后一阶段有关藏戏研究的文章和论著不仅在数量上有了大幅度的提高，且在历史渊源、剧种流派划分、藏戏剧目、面具艺术、表演音乐和现状发展等研究内容方面也有了进一步的拓展和深入。,"Comparing to the previous stage, articles and books on Tibetan opera in the later stage have not only increased in amount but also further expanded and deepened in contents including historical origins, opera divisions, opera play lists, opera masks, music performance and current researches."
5332,民族传统节日是民族文化和文明发展的标志性符号，反映了民族的生活方式、历史传统、宗教信仰、心理特征和民族情感。,"National traditional festivals are the symbolic symbols of national culture and civilization development, reflecting the lifestyle, historical traditions, religious beliefs, psychological characteristics and national sentiments of a minority nationality."
5332,插花节作为彝族的传统节日之一，它的形成和发展经历了十分漫长的历史。,The Flower Arrangement Festival is one of the traditional festivals of the Yi people.Its formation and development have experienced a very long history.
5332,插花节肩负着凝聚民族智慧，承载着传承民族文化的历史使命，经历了从虚幻到真实、从单一到多元、从小村落到大社会的不断变化和发展的过程。,"The flower arrangement festival carries national wisdom, bears the mission of inheriting national culture, and has experienced the process of constant change and development from illusory to real, from single to plural, and from a small village to a big society."
5333,闽南歌，发扬于闽南地带，在台湾则称为台语歌，流行于上世纪80年代。,"The song of Minnan is carried forward in southern Fujian.In Taiwan, it is called the Taiwanese song."
5333,在泉州，厦门，漳州一带非常流行，男女老少都会唱，特别是《出帆歌》，《欢喜就好》外出的闽南人有时候听到故乡的歌曲，会热泪盈眶。,"It was prevailing in the 1980s.These folk songs are so popular in Quanzhou, Xiamen and Zhangzhou that all men,women and children can sing, especially Sailing Ballad and the Best Joy.Minnan people sometimes hear native songs abroad, and tears always come to their faces."
5333,台湾八九十年代代表歌手有周华健、叶启田、李茂山等，进入21世纪，有林姗、黄思婷、龙千玉、蔡小虎和王识贤等。,"Famous singers at that time include Emil Chau, Ye Qitian, Lee Mao Shan, and in the the 21st century Lin Shan, and Huang Ssu Ting, long Qian Yu, Cai Xiaohu Wang Shixian and etc."
5334,侗族大歌作为民间歌曲中的一株艺术奇葩，在多声思维、多声形态、合唱技艺、文化内涵等方面都属举世罕见，尤其是其文化教育功能在培养人的智力因素和非智力因素方面具有鲜明特色。,"Songs of Dong ethnic group occupies a unique position worldwide in terms of its varieties of thoughts, voices, chorus, cultural connotation, etc.The style of singing is characterized particularly by its educational function in cultivating singers on a intellectual and non-intellectual basis."
5334,但随着时代的变迁，这一传统音乐文化的传承方式也不同程度地发生了危机。在侗族大歌变迁的脚步日趋加快的今天，我们必须要探寻出一条适合其发展的有效途径，使之成为中国乃至世界音乐文化遗产中的有机组成部分。,"Nowadays, as the times changes, the inheritance of this traditional music culture has also experienced crisis to varying degrees, which necessiates the search for a new way to inherit the gem of ancient Chinese art, making it an integral part of the musical heritage of China and the world."
5335,毛南族分龙节又称庙节，是广西环江毛南族最重要的传统节日。,"Dragon Raining Festival of Maonan is also called Miao festival, which is the most important and traditional festival in Maonan, Huanjiang county, Guangxi province."
5335,分龙节的习俗在宋代就已广泛流行于中国各地。,The custom of Dragon Raining Festival has become widely popular throughout China since Song Dynasty.
5335,"在历代中原文化向广西少数民族地区的传播与渗透的过程中，毛南族古老的土俗神崇拜宗教仪式受到中原和江南地区""分龙日""、""分龙节""节俗和道教文化的影响，形成了毛南族分龙节。","In the process of cultural transmission and permeation from the central plains of China to minority areas in Guangxi, the customs of Fenlong festival along with Taoism in the Central Plains and the regions south of the Yangtze River have had an influence on the old religious rites of worshiping local God in Maonan.In this way, Dragon raining festival of Maonan has formed．"
5336,"火把节古称""星回节""，流行于滇、贵、川等地的彝、白、汉等民族之中，一般在六月下旬和十二月下旬举行，节日的意义在于以此标志新年。有学者认为，火把节与星回节来源不同。","Torch festival is Xinghui festival in ancient times, which is popular in Yi, Bai, Han and other ethnic groups in Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan and other places and generally held in late June and late December, and its significance lies in the fact that it marks the beginning of the new year．"
5336,"但联系彝族历法中""一年两截""制遗迹和彝族传统的恒星观测法，可以论证这两个节日习俗有共同的原初本质和古老渊源，从文化积累角度看，""星回""是""火把""的底层。","However, according to the remains of ""two parts a year""  and the traditional stellar observation method of the Yi people in the Yi calendar, it can be argued that these two festival customs have a common original essence and ancient origin.From the perspective of cultural accumulation, ""Xinghui"" is the bottom layer of a torch."
5336,"火把节起源研究启示我们，中国民族学研究应注意""高文化""问题，重视文献、文物资料对于民族文明研究的意义。","The study of the origin of the Torch Festival reveals us that the reasearch of Chinese ethnology should pay attention to the issue of ""high culture"" and attach importance to the significance of literature and cultural relics for the study of national civilization."
5337,土家族大都深居在崇山峻岭，深山峡谷酉水流域，以伙耕水耨、渔猎山伐为业。,"Tujia, mostly secluded in the mountains and the Youshui basin of deep valleys, make a living by group farming, water weeding, fishing, hunting, and mountain cutting."
5337,因此，土家族民族文化，有别于其它游牧文化、高原文化与海洋文化。,"Therefore, the Tujia ethnic culture is different from other nomadic, plateau and maritime cultures."
5337,高山、峡谷、河流阻碍了土家文化的发展；隔断了民族文化的传播。,"Mountains, valleys and rivers have hindered the development of Tujia culture and cut off the spread of national culture."
5337,恰恰就是这种阻碍和隔断，铸就了土家文化的封闭性和稳定性。,It is precisely this kind of obstacle and partition that has created the closure and stability of Tujia culture.
5338,教坊是赵宋王朝最重要的俗乐机构，北宋教坊覆灭于靖康二年(1127)。,IImperial music office was the most important secular music body in the Zhao and Song dynasties.The imperial music office in the Northern Song dynasty declined in the 2nd year of Jingkang(in 1127).
5338,随着北宋政权的灭亡，教坊的主体——教坊乐人以各种方式大量损失，其方式大约有三种:一是在宋金战争中获罪，或被处死，或叛归金人；二是宋金战争前后，背井离乡，流落四方；三是被攻陷汴京的金军劫往金国。,"As the Northern Song fell, the main body of the imperial music office, a lot of musicians, disappeared in various ways.Some were convicted, or sentenced to death, or became the people of Jin dynasty in the Song-Jin war;some left their hometown and became homeless before or after the Song-Jin War;others were taken to Jin by Jin soldiers who occupied Bianjing, the capital of the Northern Song dynasty, at what is Kaifeng today."
5338,教坊乐人的流散一方面使宋代音乐文化的发展遭到了重大挫折；另一方面也促进了教坊音乐文化的传播。,"The wandering of musicians gave a heavy blow to the music development of the Song dynasty, and on the other hand, promoted the transmission of imperial music culture."
5339,元代宫廷尚金之俗直接推动了中国织金技术的发展，使得元代的中国织金技术达到了鼎盛时期。采用以文献资料为主、图像和实物资料的借鉴为辅的方法，分析了元代宫廷尚金之俗兴起的缘由，梳理了元代织金锦与纳石失发展脉络，认为元代尚金主要源自于金人用金风气习惯的承袭、游牧民族对贵金属特殊的爱好与追求，以及蒙古民族的文化传统，并使得元代织金锦形成了鲜明的时代特征，成为中西、南北交流的象征。,"The gold fashion in the palace in Yuan dynasty has directly promoted the development of gold weaving technology in China, making Chinese gold weaving technology in Yuan dynasty reach a golden age.The paper analyzes the reason of emergence of gold fashion in the palace in Yuan dynasty, sets the development course of gold weaving brocade and Nasich in Yuan dynasty mainly through document literature and assistance of the reference of images and real object data, considers that the gold fashion in Yuan dynasty mainly came from the inheritance of gold using custom of Jin people, horde's special interest in and pursuit of precious metal and cultural tradition of mongols and made gold weaving brocade in Yuan dynasty form a distinct feature of the age and become a symbol of Sino-western and north-south communication.The paper further discusses functions of apparel gold weaving fabric in Yuan dynasty."
5339,进一步探讨了元代服饰织金面料的功能，表面物服饰织金面料功用织金锦的主要用途不仅仅用于帷幔、茵褥、仪仗、舆辂等，更主要是用作服饰面料方面。,"Functional gold weaving brocade of surface apparel gold weaving fabric is not only used for purdah, cotton-padded mattress, ceremonial weaponry, and vehicles, but more used as apparel fabric."
5340,坎儿井是干旱地区劳动人民在适应自然环境过程中的智慧创举，是具有很高人文价值的地下水利工程，是人类宝贵的文化遗产。,"Karez was created with the wisdom of the working people of the arid regions in the process of adaptation to the natural environment initiative, one of the underground water conservancy projects with high human value, and the precious cultural heritage of mankind."
5340,它在我国文化史、科技史、水利史研究中具有非凡的意义，对于新疆历史的研究也具有极高的价值。,"It has great significance in our cultural history, history of science, and irrigation history research, and has a very high value for the study of the history of Xinjiang."
5340,科学、准确的认识坎儿井，需要多学科、多角度研究坎儿井的特点及历史发展过程，充分认识和挖掘坎儿井的文化内涵和实用价值，这对于更有效地保护和利用坎儿井这一文化遗产具有重要的现实意义。,"Scientific and accurate understanding of the Karez requires multi-disciplinary, multi-angle studies of the Karez characteristics and historical development, fully understanding and mining Karez cultural connotation and practical value, which is of great practical significance for the effective protection and use of the Karez."
5341,喇嘛教在内蒙古地区有着广泛的群众基础，影响到政治、经济、文化等各个领域。,"In Inner Mongolia, with abroad mass participation Lamaism exerted influence on the fields of politics, economy, culture, etc."
5341,以乌兰夫为首的共产党人为了解决蒙古民族全民信教所致的诸多社会问题进行了宗教改革。其重点是对喇嘛教的庙仓经济和上层喇嘛的生产资料进行社会主义改造，通过教育使喇嘛逐步转变为自食其力的劳动者，改造喇嘛庙中不合理的制度。,"The communists led by Wulanf implemented a religious reformation to dispel various social problems resulted from mass religious belief in Lamaism, focusing on socialist transformation on the temple economy and upper-strata lamas' own production means, educating lamas for earning their own living and reforming the irrational lamasery institutions."
5341,内蒙古宗教改革是我党解决民族问题与宗教问题的典范。,This religious reformation on Lamaism establishes a model of the Party's solving the religious and national problems.
5342,勒勒车是北方草原上应用历史悠久的交通运输工具，曾在草原牧民的生活中发挥了非常重要的作用，成为蒙古族文化的一个重要特征。,Mongolia Lele Cart is one kind of the most important transportation tools of northern grassland in ancient China.It has played a very important role in the life of Mongolia Nation and has become an important feature of Mongolian culture.
5342,然而随着现代物质文明的发展，勒勒车的实际应用越来越少，以至于其传统制作工艺逐渐消失。,"However, with the development of modern economics and technology, the practical application of the Lele car has become less and less, so that the crafts of making Lele Cart are going to be lost gradually."
5342,"根据现场调查，结合文献资料，本文对这项传统工艺进行了有效记录,详细叙述了勒勒车使用的历史概况以及制作勒勒车的工艺流程。","According to the on-site investigation, combined with the literature, this article has effectively recorded the traditional process and has also stated in detail the procedure of making Lele Cart based on the investigation and a brief history of the application of Lele Cart as well."
5343,"在中国历史上，桂西原是一个边陲社会，明清以来经历了从""化外""到""化内""，从封闭到开放的转变过程。","In our view, western Guangxi is a border community and has experienced the changing process from the ""thrust"" into the ""inside"" and from a closed to an open one."
5343,"明初政府在桂西实行土司制度，保持了当地少数民族原有的村、峒""自治""传统以及""村老""治理模式。与此同时，土司为了加强社会控制能力，也引进了户籍、黄册与里甲制度。","In the early Ming dynast, the government implemented Chieftain System, intended to rule the suburban areas indirectly.On the one hand, Chieftain region maintained the ""autonomy""　tradition of village、cave and ""cun lao"" governance system; on the other hand, basic-level Chieftain had introduced Residence、Yellow Book and Lijia systems."
5343,土州县的里甲主要行使赋役征派职能，但编户数目偏少，赋税较轻，而兵役负担较重。,"Tax-collection was the the main function performed by Lijia of the Soil County, but the number of the household is small.The tax burden was light while the burden of military servic was heavier."
5343,"广西的俍与""傜僮""的界限是以进入里甲系统为标准的，可见里甲还有族群区分的意义。","Whether or not entering the Lijia system was the standard to draw the boundary between ""lang soldiers"" and ""Yao zhuang"" of Guangxi.It follows that it was meaningful for Lijia to distinguish ethnic groups."
5343,"明清时期，桂西土州县的""俍人""村寨，基本上被编入里甲体系，从而被视同""民村""。","In the Late Ming dynasty, the village of ""lang sodiers"" of the Soil County in West Guangxi, was basically compiled into the Lijia system, which was regarded as a ""village of people""."
5343,清中期，作为基层行政组织的里甲体制基本终结，个别地方则一直延续到民国时期。,"In the middle period of the Qing dynasty, as a basic administative organization, Lijia system ended by and large, with some places continuing the system until the Republican period."
5344,佤族猎头祭鬼和剽牛祭神的仪式和内容，为我们展示出了原始宗教仪式的典型方式，即有血(猎头)有肉(剽牛)。,"Head-hunting and ox-slaughtering as a religious sacrifice of the Va people, characterizes the primitive religious sacrifice."
5344,人头祭是人对神最彻底的信服，牺牲肉体，奉献头颅；剽牛祭，对神最虔诚的态度，献上最好的食物牛肉和牛头。,"Offering the head of a man and oxasa sacrifice expressed men's full devotion and pious attitude to the god, in which man is willing to dedicate the best food or even themselves to the deity."
5344,猎头祭鬼和剽牛祭神，是佤族文化的重要特征，同时在原始宗教仪式中具有典型代表性。,This typical sacrificial rite displays the features of the Wa Culture.
5345,桂林饮食文化历史悠久，特色鲜明。,Guilin catering culture boasts its longstanding history and distinctive features.Local rice cultivation culture also has a long history.
5345,本土稻作文化源远流长，秦代灵渠的开凿沟通了中原与岭南，也促成了桂林米粉的产生；佛教从印度传入桂林，也为桂林带来了马蹄；桂林三花酒在宋代已经名扬湖广；桂林食狗保留了中原汉族饮食孑遗。,"The construction of the Lingqu canal in the Qin dynasty contributed to the communication between Zhongyuan areas and Lingnan areas as well as the birth of Guilin rice noodles.Introduction of Buddhism into Guilin from india, introduced water-chestnut into Guilin.Guilin Sanhua liquor was a household name across Zhongyuan and Lingnan areas.Guilin customary practice of eating dogs preserves epibiotic catering practice of the Han nationality in Zhongyuan areas."
5345,这些特色美食为桂林饮食文化增色颇多。,Those discussed cuisines glorify Guilin catering culture.
5346,西汉成帝在位期间修建了两座陵墓: 延陵与昌陵。,"Emperor Cheng of the Western Han dynasty built two mausoleums during his reign, i.e., the Yan Mausoleum and the Chang Mausoleum."
5346,延陵位于咸阳原上的西汉主陵区内，地理形势和历史传统十分优越；昌陵位于汉长安城东南的戏乡，地势平坦，交通便利。,"The Yan Mausoleum is situated inside the main mausoleum area of the Westerm Han dyansty on Xiangyang hills, having quite a favorable position and historical tradition, while Chang Mausoleum is situated in the Xi Township in the southeast of Han's capital---- Chang'an, having a flat terrain and convenient communications."
5346,昌陵是在延陵建设了近十年之后开始修建的，由于其所在地势等原因，建设了五年即被放弃，又返回延陵。,"The Chang Mausoleum was initiated after nearly a decade of the construction of the Yan Mausoleum.For a mumber of reasons such as its physiognomy, Chang Mausoleum was abandoned after five years of construction and returned to Yan Mausoleum."
5347,广西北部湾经济区的文化原型就是骆越文化。骆越文化历史悠久、内涵丰富。,"The cultural prototype of Guangxi Beibu Gulf Economic Zone is Luo Yue culture, which evolves in a long history and enjoys rich connotation."
5347,稻作文化是骆越文化的本质，它磨炼了骆越人及其后裔的性格；骆越古医药文化是骆越文化的衍生及其扩展，使骆越后裔得以长寿；铜鼓文化是骆越文化在文化艺术宗教信仰等方面的载体，使骆越人及其后裔的精神生活得以丰富。,"The rice culture is seen as the essence of Luo Yue culture, forging the personalities of Luo Yue people and their descendants;the ancient medicine culture is believed to be derived and develop from Luo Yue culture, insuring longevity of the people;the drum culture is the carrier of Luo Yue Culture in the arts and religious belief and so on, enriching ideological life of local people."
5347,骆越文化要复兴，必须实现现代转型。要实行现代转型，教育是关键，文化产业是手段。,"Therefore, to revive Luo Yue culture requires modernizational transformation, which relies heavily on education and cultural industry."
5348,马头琴是蒙古族特有的弓弦乐器，并且历史悠久。,"Morinhuur is a kind of the stringed instrument of the Mongolia nationality, and has a long history."
5348,在传统社会中不同的部落之间对马头琴类乐器有不同的称谓和演奏方式。,"In the traditional society, the musical instruments of morihuur have different names and different play modes in different tribes."
5348,新中国成立后马头琴艺术得以迅速发展并取得成功。,"After the founding of new China, morinhuur art has developed rapidly and achieved success."
5348,"这种发展模式可称为""专业化""的发展模式。其中马头琴乐曲创作方面取得了最为瞩目的成绩。","This kind of development mode can be described as ""specialized"", with which the morinhuur has achieved impressive success in terms of its musical creation."
5349,苗族古歌对于苗族来说是百科全书般的史诗，是对苗族的历史和文化的综合反映。,"The Miao epic song, an encyclopedia-like epic poem for the Miao ethnic minority, is a comprehensive reflection of the history and culture of the Miao people."
5349,苗族古歌表达了丰富的文化信息和元素，所以它是创意产业发展的重要文化资源。,"The Miao epic song boasts rich cultural information and elements, so it is an important cultural resource for the development of the creativity industry."
5349,利用其独有的特色，把苗族古歌发展为一种文化产品是有其可行性和实用性的。,It is feasible and practical to develop the Miao epic song into a cultural product with its unique characteristics.
5350,1912 年民国肇兴，千年帝制宣告终结，财产的重新分配问题也伴随而来。,"After the founding of the Republic of China in 1912, the feudal monarchies in China as long as more than 2000 years ended.And with it comes the division of property."
5350,河北旗地，这一清代所特有的土地形态，随着朝代更替，因其归属及地域的特殊性而在新的时代中引发了错综复杂、涉及深广的利益争夺。,"The banner legacy in Hebei, one special land of the Qing dynasty, raised the complex competition due to its particularity of ownership and location."
5350,对此，民国政府成立了专门机构对其进行了较长时间的清理和处分。,"Therefore, the special institution was established to resolve the banner legacy for a long time by the government of the Republic of China."
5351,辛店文化的墓葬形制以长方形竖穴土坑墓为主，还有一些横穴洞室墓。,"In Xindian culture, the tomb construction are dominated by the rectangle tombs with vertical earthen shaft graves besides catacombs."
5351,葬式以仰身直肢葬为主，其次为二次葬与屈肢葬。,"Funeral customs are dominated by backward extended burials, besides twice burials and flexed burials."
5351,随葬陶容器的数量不太多，常见的有双耳陶罐、彩陶壶与双大耳彩陶罐等。,"Accessories of pottery vessels in buries are not too many, and the most common vessels of pottery are two-handled earthenware jars, painted pottery pots and two big ear painted earthenware jars."
5351,辛店文化的经济形态应是以农业为主，兼营畜牧和狩猎的混合经济。,"The economy of Xindian culture is based on the agriculture, and it is also a mixed economy of animal husbandry and hunting."
5351,辛店文化的族属可能就是青铜时代中国西北地区的古代羌人。,The clan of Xindian culture probably dates to the Qiang people in northwestern China during the Bronze Age.
5352,"《老子》是中国传统文化的重要经典之一，老子将""慈""、""俭""和""不敢为天下先""视为""三宝""。","Laozi is one of the important classics of the Chinese traditional culture.Laozi has regarded kindness, thrift and  not being the first as the three treasures."
5352,"""慈""即爱民，""以百姓之心为心""，""俭""即俭朴、寡欲，反对奢靡，""不敢为天下先""即无为而无不为。",Kindness is loving the people and thinking for the people.Thrift is saving and fighting against luxury.Not Being the first is inaction.
5352,"""三宝""思想具有重要的现代廉政建设价值。",The three-treasure theory has an important value in modern clean government construction.
5352,"挖掘""三宝""思想的廉政建设元素，为当代中国廉政建设服务。",And thus the three-treasure thought should be explored to help build a clean government in contemporary China.
5353,内蒙古三河牛是我国自主培育的乳肉兼用型品种，它是呼伦贝尔各族人民一百多年来辛勤劳动的结晶。,Sanhe cattle in Inner Mongolia is a local dual-purpose breed formed and approved in China with more than 100 years' developing history in Hulunbuir pasture.
5353,从1986年育成以来，三河牛以核心家系选育的方式延续严格的保种制度，在呼伦贝尔草原严酷环境中保持良好的生产性能和繁殖力。,"Since it was approved as a breed in 1986, this breed was preserved by adopting selection within family lines in the nucleolus herd, and both its performance and reproduction efficiency were preserved under the harsh condition in Hulunbuir pasture."
5353,虽然在近20年不断受到荷斯坦牛等高产品种的挑战，但对当地气候的高度适应性和良好的兼用性让三河牛始终立于不败之地。,"Although Sanhe cattle was challenged by high-yield breeds during the past 20 years, such as Holstein, it remains as a major breed because it was highly adapted for the local environment and had excellent performance in meat and milk production."
5354,西汉早期的石槨画像常见菱形纹饰、玉璧、树木、人物、楼阁等画像。,"There were diamond ornamentations and patterns of jade discs, trees, figures, pavilions, etc. in the early Western Han dynasty mastaba."
5354,比较当时大型墓葬的棺槨装饰得知，菱形纹饰以及玉璧画像可谓模拟当时贵族的漆棺镶玉装饰。,"Compared with ornamentations in other large tombs at that time, the diamond ornamentation was copied from the pattern of aristocratic sarcophaguses, while the jade disc pattern was from the real jade disc of aristocratic funeral objects."
5354,相对于此，树木纹饰可谓象征良木棺槨自身，进而象征墓上的封树等。,"On the other hand, the tree pattern was a symbol of coffins and trees surrounding the tomb."
5354,除此，人物纹饰则是如同人俑一般，可谓服侍墓主的象征。,"In addition, lifelike patterns of figures were symbols of servants in tombs."
5355,拓跋鲜卑是我国古代北方少数民族之一，曾建立北魏，统一中国北方，在历史舞台上发挥了重要作用。,"Tuoba Xianbei is one of the northern ethnic minorities and played an important role in Chinese ancient history, which found the Northern Wei and united northern China."
5355,在与两晋的交往中，双方在政治上建立了封赐、朝贡与质子关系，在军事上则相互联合。,"Tuoba Xianbei and the Jin dynasty (Western Jin and Eastern Jin) built a political relation in the form of ennoblement, tribute and hostage and united in military affairs."
5355,此外，拓跋鲜卑还十分重视对汉族士人的招抚与任用。,"Besides, Tuoba Xianbei also attached great importance to offering amnesty and enlistment to the Han senior personage."
5356,凉山彝族服饰种类繁多，体系复杂，异彩纷呈。彝族服饰因明快、古朴而闻名。,"Dressings of Lis in Liangshan are various, complicated and colorful, which are also famous for their brightness and ancientness."
5356,同时，黎族人认为男人不留胡须为最美，所以他们经常把自己的胡须刮得非常干净。,"Meanwhile, no beard is considered beautiful by the Lis, so they shave off their beard all the time."
5357,佛虽说“凡诸有相，皆为虚妄”，但于现世仍然通过形象来传达教理教义，以使着相的有情众生得以度脱成为可能。,"Although Buddhism states that everything is sunya, but in order to release people in real life from attaching to appearance, images were used to deliver the messages of doctrines."
5357,其中佛菩萨的体姿、法器、坐骑、手印等，无一不使佛教思想与典籍内容通过它们传达给人们。,"And through diversified images of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas including their different postures, dharma-vessels,  mounts and mudras, basic ideas of Buddhism and the contents in scriptures are conveyed to common people."
5357,我们熟悉的普贤形象，无论是显宗的还是密宗的，几乎都可以在佛经中找到用以比喻普贤思想的依据。正是这些经典的传译留存，给研究普贤形象以及挖掘蕴涵于其中的佛教思想提供了参考。,"Different images of Samantabhadra, no matter in exotoric Buddhism or esoteric Buddhism, serve to better understand the ideas of Samantabhadra in sacred writings which are in the process of transmission and reinterpretation and lead us to either study Samantabhadra figures or dredge up the Buddhist ideas."
5358,广西龙胜瑶族多数人的母语依然是瑶语。其中，单语人占19.15%，双语人占80.85%。,"Yao language is still the mother tongue of Yao nationality in Longsheng, Guangxi, among whom 19.15% are monolingual and 80.85% are bilingual."
5358,家庭内部主要使用瑶语。,Yao language is mainly used within a family.
5358,在教学语言上，多数人主张在中小学使用普通话(约占三分之二)。,"In language teaching, the majority of people have suggested the use of Mandarin in primary and secondary schools(about two-thirds)."
5358,有一半左右的瑶族，对瑶语的媒体功能、市面用语功能和用立法手段促进瑶文工作，感到信心不足。,"About half of the Yao are not confident enough about the media features of Yao language, function of market language, legislation means to promote the work of Yao language."
5358,瑶族对普通话的认可度较高，认为普通话有用，其认同是功能优先性的。,"Yao people attach great recognition to Mandarin, which is regarded to be useful.Such recognition is considered from a functional perspective."
5359,阴山风景画既既保留了本民族的文化，又具有当代的本土文化特色，发扬本土文化元素研究本土文化，积极的与当代艺术进行交融与发展，使其成为中国艺坛上不可缺少的一朵奇葩。,"The Yinshan landscape paintings not only retain the national culture but also blend with the contemporary art.These paintings promote the native cultural elements as well as develop with the contemporary art, which makes themselves become a vital part of Chinese art."
5359,《阴山风景系列》以阴山岩画表现内容中所反映的游牧文化为创作源点，从构图、线条、画面表现内容及表现手法上，展现草原民族天人合一的自然、真实的生活状况。,
5359,问题：语病优化：阴山风景画既既保留了本民族的文化，又具有当代的文化特色，在发扬本土文化元素研究本土文化，积极地与当代艺术进行交融与发展，使其成为中国艺坛上不可缺少的一朵奇葩。,
5359,《阴山风景系列》以阴山岩画表现内容中所反映的游牧文化为创作源点，从构图、线条、画面表现内容及表现手法上，展现草原民族天人合一的自然、真实的生活状况。,"The Yinshan landscape series refers to the creative source of the nomadic culture reflected by the contents of Yinshan Rock paintings.The series presents the natural harmonious real life of the ethic group by composing, lining, giving surface content of pictures and techniques of expression."
5360,白银在我国货币史上曾一度独领风骚。,Silver had been the most important money in Chinese monetary history.
5360,自从明朝中后期成为我国经济交往和贸易生活的主要货币后，白银便在中国近代社会的经济发展、政治稳定和外交延伸上起着重要的历史作用。,"Ever since it took the role as the prominent currency in the Ming dynasty in terms of business and trade, silver had played an important historic role in the economic development, political stability and diplomatic extension of China."
5360,虽然我国不产白银，但由于当时我国以白银为最主要货币，使得世界其它国家的白银大量地流入我国。,"Although China did not produce silver by itself, the silver of other places of the world flowed into China in large quantities due to its need of large amount of silver as the main currency."
5361,瑶族度戒源于早期正一道的授科仪，瑶族度戒仪式中的诸多道教因素，反映出瑶族宗教道教化的特质。,"Originating from the rite of talisman conferred in the Way of Orthodox Unity (an early sect of Taoism), the rite of dujie reflects many Taoist elements and the convert to Taoism in Yao religion."
5361,道教在瑶族社会的传播及其与瑶民族文化相结合而发生的衍变，通过在瑶族社会具有深远影响的度戒可以得到说明。,The far-reaching rite also shows the spread of Taoism in the Yao society and the combination of Taoism and the native culture among the Yao people.
5361,度戒作为瑶族吸取道教思想而形成的仪礼，在瑶族社会中发挥的宗教功能，具有深刻的人类学意义。,"As a rite representing the Taoist thought, dujie plays a religious part with profound anthropological significance in the Yao society."
5362,在中国，传统中秋节是历史悠久的总要节日。,The traditional Mid-Autumn Festival has a long history in China.
5362,在几千年的发展进程中其早已成为人们生活不可或缺的一部分，早已成为创造与传承民族精神的重要载体。,"During thousands of years' development, it has already become an indispensable part of people's life and an important carrier for the shaping and inheriting of national spirit."
5362,然而，随着社会的不断进步，全球化的慢慢形成，传统中秋节日文化正被人们逐渐淡忘。,"However, with the progress of society as well as globalization, traditional Mid-Autumn Festival culture has been gradually forgotten."
5362,因此为了传承和发扬中国传统文化，对传统中秋节进行改革和创新使之适应现代人的需求是极有必要的。,"Therefore, in order to inherit and carry forward traditional Chinese culture, it is quite necessary to reform and make innovation in the traditional Mid-Autumn Festival to meet the needs of modern people."
5363,对于壮锦这一能够在新的社会语境背景下获得生存与发展空间的民族传统来说，它自身深厚的文化底蕴和现实价值是其在现代资本运作的基础。,"For the Zhuang Brocade, which is an ethnic tradition that can survive and develop under the background of new social context, the rich cultural connotation and realistic value are the basis for its modern capital operation."
5363,在多种话语并置的现代社会，衍生于传统的壮锦文化符号在当代的发展，虽然不可避免地离开了原初语境，使得原生形态亦逐渐淡化，但却是在原初文化语境的影响场域之下得以重塑。,"In the modern society with the coexistence of multiple discourse, though the development of the Zhuang Brocade cultural symbol which derives from tradition inevitably departs from the original context and its primitive state fades gradually, it's reshaped under the influence of the original cultural context."
5363,历史积淀和民族文化是壮锦文化品牌打造的核心要素，一步步地将其编织为壮族文化符号的代表。,The historical accumulation and the ethnic culture are the core elements for the brand building of the Zhuang Brocade culture.
5364,北路壮剧孕育于北部壮族生产生活的土壤中，是在壮族民间歌舞的基础上发展而成的艺术形式，它反映了壮族民众的文化心理和审美情趣，曾在北部壮族人民的精神生活中有着不可替代的地位，有较高的艺术价值。,"Beilu Zhuang opera, based on Zhuang people's folk songs and dances, is an art form developing from the work and life of Zhuang people in the northern part.It reflects Zhuang people's cultural psychology and aesthetic interest.Zhuang opera has artistic value and plays an irreplaceable role in Zhuang people's spiritual life."
5364,然而在知识全球化的今天，北路壮剧的发展现状不容乐观，已出现青黄不接的态势。,"But nowadays with the globalization of knowledge, the development of Beilu Zhuang opera is not optimistic."
5364,为此，怎样保护和传承北路壮剧，是当下一个亟待解决的问题。,"Therefore, how to protect and inherit Beilu Zhuang opera is a problem demanding prompt solution."
5365,全面性是贝特森的关键字；把我们人类放到整体的“生活系统”中进行理解对于我们的生存本质来说显得至关重要。,"Holism was a key word for Bateson; an understanding of our human part in the whole ""living system"" that was the world he saw as crucial for our earthly survival."
5365,此外，人类学必须要成为作专门化的“跨学科的学科”，因为只有整体综合（也许似乎有些业余性）运用各种形态的信息才有望抓住处于文化建构和社会互动中的世界的“巨大的复杂性” (Bateson 1959:296)。,"Furthermore, anthropology had to be a non-specialist, ""interdisciplinary discipline"" because only in a holistic (however seemingly seeming amateurish) use of all manner of information could it expect to tackle the ""vast intricacies"" of the worlds of cultural construction and social interaction (Bateson 1959:296)."
5365,因此，人类学理解需要与人种学、生态学、生物学、哲学、美学以及心理分析联系起来。,"Hence the need for an anthropological understanding to connect up with ethnology, ecology, biology, philosophy, aesthetics and psychoanalysis."
5365,这将会带来新的生态世界观，美学和意识能在此合二为一的形成“神圣的”关于生活唯一性以及生活一元实体论的认识。,"This might then give onto a new ecological world-view where aesthetics and consciousness combined to form a ""sacred"" recognition of the one-ness of life, of life's ontological monism."
5366,二战后美国人类学的标志是存在于唯物主义和心智主义之间的紧张关系，这两种思潮各自都随着时间而经历了转变，但这种紧张关系持续到了1990年代。,"After World War II American cultural anthropology was marked by the tension between materialisms and mentalisms; each of these underwent shifts over time, but the tension continued into the 1990s."
5366,尽管它很大程度上受到了来自国外出生的学者（这些学者从卡尔˙维特弗格尔和卡尔˙波拉尼到埃里克˙沃尔夫和维克托˙特纳）的贡献的影响，但它主要是一个土生土长的发展过程并且成为了一个独特的美国式争论。,"Although much influenced by the contributions of foreign-born scholars from Karl Wittfogel and Karl Polanyi to Eric Wolf and Victor Turner, this was primarily a homegrown development, and it became a singularly American argument."
5366,例如，双方都回应了1960年代的政治剧变和学术界中新声音的加人.但它们是通过以不同方式重塑人类学来实现这一回应的。,"For example, both sides reacted to the political upheavals of the 1960s and to the entry of new voices into the academy, but they did so with different kinds of reinventions of anthropology."
5367,另一个主要观点，深受列宁（Lenin）和托洛茨基（Trotsky）对帝国主义的分析的影响，他们强调了富裕国家对贫穷国家的剥削，而且两者的经济和政治的接触不会导致后者的“发展”，相反，而是导致它们激烈的欠发达状态。,"The other main view, which is influenced by Lenin's and Trotsky's analyses of imperialism, instead emphasises the ways in which the rich countries exploit the poor ones and that economic and political contact does not lead to the ""development"" of the latter, but instead to their active underdevelopment."
5367,巨大的国家债务、贫穷国家售出商品（多数是原材料）的低廉价格、跨国公司对利润的榨取都是这种结构不平等的症状（例如，参见Frank 1979）。,"Large state debts, low prices put on the goods the poor countries sell (mostly raw materials) and the extraction of profits by multinational companies are symptoms of this situation of structural inequality (see for instance Frank 1979)."
5367,因此，战后几十年的去殖民化并没有为贫穷国家带来真正的独立和解放，因为它们被牢固地绑缚在他们注定会输掉的资本主义体系之中。,"Thus the de-colonisation of the post-war decades did not lead to the true independence and emancipation of poor countries, since they were tied up with a global capitalist system in which they were bound to lose out."
5367,此外，从文化的层面上说，受到新帝国主义理论影响的学者会认为，以前被殖民过的民族变得要依赖前殖民者的各种模式和知识体系了。,"At the level of culture, moreover, writers influenced by the theory of neo-imperialism have argued that formerly colonised peoples become dependent on the models and knowledge systems of the former colonisers."
5368,由于博厄斯的影响，从摩根开始的唯物论传统在20世纪上半叶的美国隐至幕后，而在后来以文化生态学和新进化论的面目重现江湖，摩根的理论遗产也被许多马克思主义人类学家所认可。,"Due to Boas's influence, the materialist tradition from Morgan fell into the background in the USA during the first half of the twentieth century.It would later re-emerge as cultural ecology and neo-evolutionism, and Morgan's legacy would also be acknowledged by many Marxist anthropologists."
5368,但是现在，摩根的进化主义被牢牢地转移到了次要地位，这可能是受到达尔文的进化理论的影响。,"But for now, Morgan's evolutionism was firmly sidetracked, as was any potential influence from Darwin's theory of evolution."
5368,现代美国人类学已经成形，一方面是受博厄斯派学者及其相对主义关注点的驱动，另一方面是感知到在本土文化不幸消失之前进行记录的需要。与此同时，在主要的殖民强国大不列颠的情况却非常不同。,"While modern American anthropology had been shaped, on the one hand by the Boasians and their relativist concerns, and on the other hand by the perceived need to record native cultures before their feared disappearance, the situation in the major colonial power, Great Britain, was very different."
5368,殖民机构和在殖民地工作的人类学家之间存在多大程度的共谋，一直是个引起争论的问题（Goody 1995）。但是帝国主义的事实对于英国人类学家来说，即使是含蓄的，也是一个无可逃避的前提，至少在去殖民地化之前如此。,"The degree of complicity between colonial agencies and anthropologists working in the colonies is debatable (Goody 1995), but the very fact of imperialism was an inescapable, if usually implicit, premise for British anthropology at least until de-colonisation."
5369,在新居制（neolocal residence）中，一对已婚夫妇在另一个地方独立门户。,"Under neolocal residence, a married couple forms a household in an independent location."
5369,这种情况发生在核心家庭独立性受到重视的地方。,This occurs where the independence of the nuclear family is emphasized.
5369,在像美国那样的工业社会中，大 部分经济活动都发生在家庭之外而非其内部，而且对个体来说重要的是能够搬迁到能找到工作的地方去，因此新居制就比其他任何一种居处模式都适合于美国。,"In industrial societies such as the United States, where most economic activity occurs outside rather than inside the family and where it is important for individuals to be able to move where jobs are found, neolocal residence is better suited than any of the other patterns."
5369,从舅居（avunculocal residence）是指一对已婚夫妇和新郎的舅舅生活在-起（参见图9.3）。支持从舅居的因紊与促成从父居的因素一样，但是它只发生在人们认 为通过女性继嗣对于重要权利和财产的转移至关重要的社会中。,"Avunculocal residence, in which a married couple goes to live with the groom's mother's brother (Figure 9.3) is favored by the same factors that promote patrilocal residence, but only in societies where descent through women is deemed crucial for the transmission of important rights and property."
5370,事物的形式是它的结构、框架和语法。,"The form of something is its structure, its skeleton, its grammar."
5370,形式带来分类以及同类的汇聚、类别、分类、图式、语言、循环和分类体系。,"Forms amount to categories and collections of categories, taxonomies, schemata, languages, rotas, systems of classification."
5370,而且世界及其各个方面只在形式的组织下才可能成为经验和知识的对象。,"Moreover, the world and its aspects only become possible matters of experience and knowledge when constituted by forms."
5370,形式通过在事物之间划定界线加以区分，从而否定事物的连续性。,Forms negate the continuity of matter by introducing the distinctions that make things separate.
5370,所以，形式指出了限定的条件，只有在这些前提条件下才可能获得特定的经验和知识。,"Thus, forms specify the conditions under which it is possible to have a certain kind of experience and acquire a certain kind of knowledge."
5371,语言的语法（grammar）最后由所有关于其词素和句法的观察资料组成。,The grammar of the language ultimately will consist of all observations about its morphemes and syntax.
5371,进一步的工作可能是借助替换框架确立语言的所有形式类（form classes）：在句子中以相同方式起作用的言语部分或词类。,"Further work may include the establishment, by substitution frames, of all the form classes of the language: that is, the parts of speech or categories of words that work the same way in any sentence."
5371,例如，我们可以确立我们称之为“名词”的一个类别，把它界定为适合于“我看到……”这一替换框架的任何词。,"For example, a linguist may establish a category called nouns, defined as anything that will fit the substitution frame ""I see""."
5371,我们简单地制定这种替换框架，在其中试验一些单词，就这些单词是否适合，让当地说话人表明“是”或“否”。,"The researcher simply makes the frame, tries out a number of words in it, and has a native speaker indicate ""yes"" or ""no"" for whether the words work."
5372,性别是生物学的，而社会性别是文化的，这是重要的区分。,"The distinction between sex, which is biological, and gender, which is cultural, is an important one."
5372,据推测，社会性别的区分和人类文化一样古老——约250万年——而且起源于早期人类男性与女性的生物学差异。,"Presumably, gender differences are as old as human culture—about 2.5 million years—and arose from the biological differences between early human males and females."
5372,追溯到那时，男性个头约比女性大一倍，就如今天在大猩猩、猩猩和狒狒那类种群中那样，后者都与人类密切相关。,"Back then, males were about twice the size of females, as they are today among such species as gorillas, orangutans, and baboons, all of which are closely related to humans."
5372,然而，随着人类的演化，两性生物学差异从根本上缩小了。,"As humans evolved, however, the biological differences between the two sexes were radically reduced."
5372,因此，除了与生殖直接有关的差异外，曾经存在的社会性别角色差异的生物学基础大致消失了。,"Thus, apart from differences directly related to reproduction, whatever biological basis that once existed for gender role differences largely has disappeared."
5373,性别是生物学的，而社会性别是文化的，这是重要的区分。,"The distinction between sex, which is biological, and gender, which is cultural, is an important one."
5373,据推测，社会性别的区分和人类文化一样古老——约250万年——而且起源于早期人类男性与女性的生物学差异。,"Presumably, gender differences are as old as human culture—about 2.5 million years—and arose from the biological differences between early human males and females."
5373,追溯到那时，男性个头约比女性大一倍，就如今天在大猩猩、猩猩和狒狒那类种群中那样，后者都与人类密切相关。,"Back then, males were about twice the size of females, as they are today among such species as gorillas, orangutans, and baboons, all of which are closely related to humans."
5373,然而，随着人类的演化，两性生物学差异从裉本上缩小了。,"As humans evolved, however, the biological differences between the two sexes were radically reduced."
5373,因此，除了与生殖直接有关的差异外，曾经存在的社会性别角色差异的生物学基础大致消失了。,"Thus, apart from differences directly related to reproduction, whatever biological basis that once existed for gender role differences largely has disappeared."
5374,与阶级和等级分层密切相关的是性别分层现象。,Closely associated with class and caste stratification is the related phenomenon of gender stratification.
5374,例如，在前面我们对性别作为一种组织原则的讨论中，我们看到，在一些社会（不是所有社会）中，男性和女性可能被视为不平等的，前者的地位高于后者的地位。,"For instance, in our earlier discussion of sex as an organizing principle, we saw that in some (but not all) societies, men and women may be regarded as unequal, with the former outranking the latter."
5374,一般而言，在其他方面存在分层的社会中，也存在性别上的不平等；因此，在西方世界那些具有阶级结构的社会中，妇女地位历来就低于男子。,"Generally speaking, sexual inequality is characteristic of societies stratified in other ways as well; thus women historically have occupied a position of inferiority to men in the class-structured societies of the Western world."
5374,然而，在其他方面未分层社会中有时也会看到性别不平等。在这样的情况中，男性和女性总是在肉体和精神上彼此分割开来的。,"Nevertheless, sexual inequality sometimes may be seen in societies not otherwise stratified; in such instances, men and women are always physically as well as conceptually separated from one another."
5375,如果一个男子穿着像一个女子，那么这仍然普遍被看作是忧虑的起因，而且很可能导致精神病治疗的干预。,"If a man dresses as a woman, it is still widely considered a cause for concern and is likely to lead to psychiatric intervention."
5375,传统上由妇女干的活还没有被看成是男子适合干的。,Nor have jobs women traditionally filled been seen as desirable for men.
5375,相比之下，妇女有更大的自由穿上男子风格的服装，承担传统上由男子从事的工作，即便这样做会引起别人指责她们怎么“没有女子气”这些观点背后潜伏的是传统的价值观（习惯上与男子相关的工作比与女子相关的工作得到更髙的评价）以及儿童养育模式，它们造成两性性別身份问题，尽管问题对各个性别来说是各不相同的。,"By contrast, women have more freedom to wear masculine-style clothing and to assume jobs men traditionally held, even though to do so may cause others to brand them as somehow unfeminine.Lying behind these views are traditional values (jobs customarily associated with men have been more highly valued than those associated with women) and a pattern of child rearing that creates gender identity problems for both sexes, although of a different sort for each sex."
5376,虽然婚姻根据男女之间持久的性关系加以界定，但它不应与交配混淆。,"Although defined in terms of a continuing sexual relationship between a man and woman, marriage should not be confused with mating."
5376,虽然在婚姻内有交配，但它经常也在婚外发生。,"Although mating occurs within marriage, it often occurs outside of it as well."
5376,与交配不同的是，婚姻以社会、法律和经济的力量为后盾。,"Unlike mating, marriage is backed by social, legal, and economic forces."
5376,在某些社会，新家庭通过婚姻形成，但这并不符合所有社会的情况。,"In some societies, new families are formed through marriage, but this is not true for all societies."
5377,特兰西瓦尼亚匈牙利人与罗马尼亚人之间的关系问题不能被理解为像大不列颠或法兰西的穆斯林与“基督徒”之间一样的关系。,"The question of the relations of Hungarians and Romanians in Transylvania cannot be thought of in the same terms as the relations of Muslims and ""Christians"" in Great Britain or France."
5377,土地、历史和语言之间的关系与此毫不相干。,"The link with land, history and language has nothing to do with it."
5377,要界定这两个群体，以“少数”对“多数”来理解可能会相称一些。,
5377,,"To speak in terms of ""minority"" versus ""majority"" implies some symmetry in what defines both groups."
5378,利奇（Leach 1989: 137-8）说，和小说一样，人类学描述的特征是“来自于作者人格的某些方面。否则那还能是什么呢？我最先了解的自我就是我自己。当马凌诺夫斯基描写特罗布里安德岛民时就是在描写他自己，当埃文思-普里查德写努尔人时他也是在写他自己”。,"As in a novel, Leach elaborated (1989:137–8): features of anthropological accounts ‘are derived from aspects of the personality of the author. How could it be otherwise? The only ego I know at first hand is my own. When Malinowski writes about Trobriand Islanders he is writing about himself; when Evans-Pritchard writes about the Nuer he is writing about himself In short, ‘cultural differences, though sometimes convenient, are temporary fictions’ (ibid.)."
5378,总而言之，“文化差异，尽管有时会显得比较便捷，但都是转瞬即逝的虚构”（同上）。,
5379,因为社会中存在着很大的权力悬殊，那些有权势的人才能够比其他群体的人更加有效地提升他们自己的世界观，并且制造一种“当然”氛围，从而使得深层意识形态的观念成为这个被想当然的社会的主要部分。,"Because of considerable power disparities in society, the powerful are able to promote their own world-view much more efficiently than other groups and to give it an air of ""naturalness"", thereby making deeply ideological notions part and parcel of the taken-for-granteds of society."
5379,虚假意识的观念具有直接的吸引力。,The notion of false consciousness has an immediate appeal.
5379,看起来好像被压迫的群体不知道他们自己的利益，否则他们就会反叛，不是吗？,"It seems likely that oppressed groups do not know their own good; otherwise they would have revolted, would they not?"
5379,另一方面，对于人类学家这个社会的局外人而言，要令人信服地辩论：一个群体是其成员自身所没有意识到的错觉的受害者，却远非这么简单。,"On the other hand, it is far from easy for an anthropologist, an outsider to society, to argue convincingly that a group is the victim of delusions of which its members are not themselves aware."
5379,研究者有什么权利可以宣称，他们对一个群体的“客观利益”的了解程度比该群体自己还要深刻？,"With what right can researchers claim that they know the ""objective interests"" of a group better than they themselves do?"
5380,在人们把大部分时间用于谋生活动的社会中，财富差异程度不大，这种社会通过调整机制和互惠制度保持那种状况，调整机制和互惠制度的作用是以一种相当公平的方式来分配现有微不足道的财产。,"In societies where people devote most of their time to subsistence activities, gradations of wealth are small, kept that way through leveling mechanisms and systems of reciprocity that serve to distribute in a fairly equitable fashion what little wealth exists."
5380,"显示社会威望，即经济学家索尔斯坦˙凡勃伦所谓的炫耀性消费(conspicuous consumption),在有实质性剩余产品生产出来的社会中，是财富分配的强有力的驱动力。","Display for social prestige, what economist Thorstein Veblen called conspicuous consumption, is a strong motivating force for the distribution of wealth in societies where a substantial surplus is produced."
5380,当然，长期以来，人们已经认识到，在西方社会，当一个人与别人争威望时，炫耀性消费起到显著作用。,"It has, of course, long been recognized that conspicuous consumption plays a prominent role in Western societies as individuals compete with one another for prestige."
5381,我们离开纳亚尔人之前，需要指出的是，在他们的社会，没有任何东西是与北美社会的已知家庭类似的，这一点是很重要的。,"Before we leave the Nayar, it is important to note that nothing in this society is comparable to the family as we know it in North America."
5381,"形成家户的群体不包括姻亲(affinal kin),即由婚姻建立夫妻关系(conjugal bond)所加入的那些个人就如在第九章我们将证明的，家户并不非得是像我们所知道的那种家庭。","The group that forms the household does not include affinal kin, or individuals joined by a conjugal bond established by marriage.As will be shown in Chapter 9, a household group does not have to be a family as we know it."
5381,在纳亚尔人中，家户完全是由我们通常所谓的“血缘”亲属组成的，“血缘”亲属技术上被称为血亲（consanguineal kin)。,"Among the Nayar the household is composed wholly of what we often call ""blood"" relatives,lechnicallknowacon-sanguineal kin."
5381,性关系是与非血亲、因此而住在另一个家户的那些人的关系。,Sexual relations are with those who are not consanguineal kin and thus live in other households.
5381,这把我们引 向另一个人类普遍的问题:乱伦禁忌。,"This brings us to another supposed human universal, the incest taboo."
5382,如果我们用熟悉的术语把家庭定义为必须是父亲、母亲和孩子的话，那么我们就必须说，像纳亚尔人(我们在第九章将看到，他们并不是唯一的案例)那样的民族的确没有家庭。,"If we were to define the family in familiar terms, as requiring fathers, mothers, and children, then we would have to say people like the Nayar (who, as we shall see in Chapter 9, do not constitute a unique case) do not have families."
5382,然而，我们可以用较少种族中心主义的方式把家庭定义为：由一个女子和她扶养的孩子以及至少一个通过婚姻或血源关系加入的成年男子组成的群体。,"We can, however, define the family in a less ethnocentric way as a group composed of a woman and her dependent children and at least one adult male joined through marriage or blood relationship."
5382,(非传统家庭的主题将在第九章讨论。,
5382,"）纳亚尔人形成血缘家庭(consanguine),它由女子、她们扶养的子女以及女子的兄弟组成。","The Nayar form a consanguine family, consisting as it does of women, their dependent offspring, and the women's brothers."
5383,对不计其数的男人和女人来说，这不是问题。,Yet for innumerable women and men this is not the case.
5383,没有民族可以归属：他们是另一类的“局外人”、移民、寻求避难所的人、民族解放运动成员。,"There is no nation to belong to: they are ""outsiders"" of another kind, migrants, asylum seekers, members of national liberation movements."
5383,我们不能假设女人或男人与民族和民族主义的关系：那属于我们需要提问而寻找答案的事情。,"We cannot assume either women’s or men's relation to nations or nationalisms: it is something about which we need to ask questions, seek answers."
5384,行为环境的最后方面是规范定向。,A final aspect of the behavioral environment is the normative orientation.
5384,在源头上纯粹是文化的价值、理想和标准，就如树木、河流和山脉一样，是个人行为环境的一部分。,"Values, ideals, and standards, which are purely cultural in origin, are as much a part of an individuals behavioral environment as are trees, rivers, and mountains."
5384,没有它们，人们在评价他们自己的行为或别人的行为时就会没有任何依据。,Without them people would have nothing to judge their actions or those of others against.
5384,简言之，自我意识的自我评价方面不能被看作是实用的。,"In short, the self-appraisal aspect of self-awareness could not be made functional."
5384,与文化的任何方面一样，一个社会与另一个社会的自我概念有相当大的差异。,"Like any aspect of culture, conceptions of the self vary considerably from one society to another."
5384,佩诺布斯科特印第安人，是在某一时期依靠捕鱼、狩猎和采集野生食物为生的民族 (寻食者），他们的后代今天仍然生活在北美东北地区的林地里，可以作为一个范例。,"The Penobscot Indians, a people who at one time relied on fishing, hunting, and the gathering of wild plants (food foraging) for subsistence, and whose descendants still live today in the wood¬lands of northeastern North America, serve as an example."
5385,寻食社会的一个重要特点是它的平等主义。,An important characteristic of the food-foraging society is its egalitarianism.
5385,寻食者通常是髙度流动的。而且又缺乏动物或机械运输工具，特别是去远处获取食物时，他们必须能不承担许多东西行进。,"Food foragers are usually highly mobile, and, lacking animal or mechanical transportation, they must be able to travel without many encumbrances, especially on foodgetting expeditions."
5385,例如，在朱瓦西人中，每个个人的所有物的平均重量在25磅以下。,"The average weight of an individual's personal belongings among the Juhoansi, for example, is just under 25 pounds."
5385,寻食者的物质产品必须限制在最低限度的必需品上，它们包括用于狩猎、采集、捕鱼、建屋的工具，以及制造工具、烹饪器具、捅捉机和网。,"The material goods of food foragers must be limited to the barest essentials, which include implements for hunting, gathering, fishing, building, and making tools, cooking utensils, traps, and nets."
5385,他们很少有机会积累奢侈品或剩余物品，而且没有谁能拥有比别人多得多的物品，这一事实有助于限制地位差异。,"They have little chance to accumulate luxuries or surplus goods, and the fact no one owns significantly more than others helps to limit status differences."
5385,年龄和性别通常是重要的地位差别的唯一根源。,Age and sex are usually the only sources of significant status differences.
5386,另外一种对压制性变迁的常见反应是复兴，这是我们在第十三章已经讨论过的一种文化过程。,"Another common reaction to forcible change is revitalization, a process already touched upon in Chapter 13."
5386,复兴可以被看作是由社会中的成员进行的一种刻意尝试，他们想通过迅速接受一种带有多项创新的模式来建设一种更加令人满意的文化。,Revitalization may be looked upon as a deliberate attempt by some members of a society to construct a more satisfactory culture by the rapid acceptance of a pattern of multiple innovations.
5386,一旦主要的文化纽带、社会关系和活动被打破，而无意义的活动又被外界力量强加进来。个体和群体通常就会做出幻想、退缩和逃离的反应。,"Once primary ties of culture, social relationships, and activities are broken and meaningless activity is imposed by force, individuals and groups characteristically react with fantasy, withdrawal, and escape."
5386,复兴运动的事例在美国历史上一直很常见，每当社会中有相当一部分人发现他们的生活条件与“美国之梦”的价值相偏离的时候，就会出现这种运动。,Examples of revitalization movements have been common in the history of the United States whenever significant population segments have found their conditions in life to be at odds with the values of uthe American Dream.
5387,所有文化都共享某些基本的特点，研究这些特点可以阐明文化本身的性质和功能。,
5387,文化不可能没有社会而存在，社会是为了生存而相互依赖的有组织的人群。由规则支配的关系被称为社会结构。社会结构使社会团结在一起在一种文化内部并非一切都是一致的。一个原因是，在任何社会中男性与女性的角色总是存在某种差异。,All is not uniform within a culture; one reason is that some differences exist between male and female roles in any human society.
5387,人类学家用社会性别这一术语指文化分派给男女生物学差异的解释或意义。,Anthropologists use the term gender to refer to the elaborations or meanings cultures assign to the biological differences between men and women.
5387,"年龄差异也是普遍的,在某些文化中，还存在其他亚文化变化形式。","Age variation is also universal, and in some cultures other subcultural variations occur as well."
5387,亚文化共享某个较大文化的至关重要的假定，而遵守一套特别不同的规则。,A subculture shares certain overarching assumptions of the larger culture while observing a distinctively different set of rules.
5388,基本结构包括直接交换的各种体系，也就是说，一个集团与另一个集团互换妻子。,"Elementary structures include systems of direct exchange, where a group may ‘take’ wives from the same group it ‘gives’ wives to."
5388,最简单的一种形式就是一个男人与其母亲的兄弟的女儿 (MBD)  或父亲的姊妹的女儿(FZD)结婚，就像在南美和澳大利亚的一些地方那样。,"The simplest type is one involving marriage between a man and his mother’s brother’s daughter (MBD) or father’s sister’s daughter (FZD), as in some parts of South America and Australia."
5388,基本结构还包括延迟直接交换制度。,Elementary structures also include systems of delayed direct exchange.
5389,社会阶级在几个方面是外显的。,
5389,,Social classes are manifested in several ways.
5389,一个是通过言词评价（verbal evaluation）人们对他们自己社会中的其他人所说的话。,One is through verbal evaluation—what people say about others in their own society.
5389,"对此，任何东西都可能被挑出来受到关 注，并被加以赞同或不赞同的评价:政治的、军事的、宗教的、经济的或者专业的角色，财富和财产，亲属关系，个人性质(比如肤色）,社区活动，语言，以及很多其他特性。","For this, anything can be singled out for attention and spoken of favorably or unfavorably: political, military, religious, economic, or professional roles; wealth and property; kinship; personal qualities (skin color, for example); community activity; linguistic dialect; and a host of other traits."
5390,绘画艺术既可以被看成是具象的，也可以被看成是抽象的，而实际上，送些类别只是代表一个连续变化体的两极。,"Pictorial art may be regarded as either representational or abstract, though in truth these categories represent polar ends of a continuum."
5390,非洲南部的岩石艺术说明了研究艺术可采用的三种研究方式。,The rock art of southern Africa illustrates three ways the study of art may be approached.
5390,美学的和叙事的研究方式集中关注事物怎样得到描绘，以及什么事物得到描绘。它们本身很少揭示艺术究竟是什么，并可能表达出有关创造该艺术的民族的歪曲看法。,The aesthetic and narrative approaches focus on how and what things are depicted.By themselves they reveal little about what the art is all about and may convey a distorted view of the people responsible for it.
5390,只有阐释的研究方式能够揭示另一个民族艺术的意义。这种研究方式需要借用丰富的民族志和其他各祌可靠的资料。,Only the interpretive approach can reveal the meaning of another peopled art.This approach requires drawing on a rich body of ethnography and often other sets of data.
5391,重要的是认识到，稳定和变迁都包含在演化的调适内，而且一且达到令人满意的调适，变迁程度太大却可能使它失效。,"It is important to recognize that stability as well as change is involved in evolutionary adaptation and that once a satisfactory adaptation is achieved, too much change may cause it to break down."
5391,因此，一段重大变迁可能紧随着长期的相对稳定。,"Thus, episodes of major change may be followed by long periods of relative stability."
5391,例如，在公元前3500年，新英格兰西北部和魁北克南部的生活方式已演化成形，很适合那个时代的环境状况。,"For example, by 3500 B.C., a way of life had evolved in northwestern New England and southern Quebec that was well attuned to the environmental conditions of the times."
5391,因为那些状况在以后的5000年左右或多或少仍然是稳定的，所以人们的生活方式也依然如此，这是可以理解的。,"Since those conditions remained more or less stable for the next 5,000 years or so, it is understandable that people's lifeways also remained stable."
5392,普遍进化论作为单线进化论的教条的一种软化 ， 出现于 20 世纪初。,Universal evolutionism emerged in the early twentieth century as a softening of the tenets of unilinear evolutionism.
5392,根据新的田野民族志和考古证据，确切的跨文化一致且遍布世界的单线进化阶段不能再维持下去了。,"In light of new ethnographic and archaeological evidence, precise unilinear phases, consistent cross-culturally and throughout the world, could no longer be sustained."
5392,所以取而代之，假定存在更  广泛的、“普遍的”进化阶段，比如“蒙昧”、 “野蛮”、“文明”（其中摩尔根所支持的）之间的经典划分等。,"So instead, broad, ‘universal’ phases of evolution were postulated, such as the classical division between ‘savagery’, ‘barbarism’, and ‘civilization’ (championed by Morgan, among others)."
5393,我们简略地考察当代北美社会的做法，就可以看到婚姻与交配区别。在北 美社会，一夫一妻制（monogamy)——获得单个配偶——是唯一合法的婚姻形式。,"The distinction between marriage and mating may he seen by looking, briefly, at practices in contemporary North American society, where monogamy—the taking of a single spouse—is the only legally recognized form of marriage."
5393,不仅其他形式得不到法律认可，而且财产和财富得以从一代传到下一代的继承制度也以一夫一妻制婚姻制度为根据。,"Not only are other forms not legally sanctioned, but also systems of inheritance, whereby property and wealth are transferred from one generation to the next, are predicated upon the institution of monogamous marriage."
5393,相比之下，交配模式经常不是单配偶的。,"Mating patterns, by contrast, are frequently not monogamous."
5393,不仅在美国和加拿大通奸绝不是罕见的，而且异性个体——特别是未婚的年轻人——婚外同居已被认为是可接受的。,"Not only is adultery far from rare in the United States and Canada, but also it has become increasingly acceptable for individuals of the opposite sex particularly young people who have not yet married—to live together outside of wedlock."
5394,然而，他们通过研究各个时代和各个地方的所有人，不断努力使偏见问题最小化，他们不使自己局限于当代西方民族的研究。人类学家已经发现，要充分理解人的观念和行为的复杂性，必须研究过去的和现在的所有的人。,"However, they constantly seek to minimize the problem by studying the whole of humanity in all times and places, and they do not limit themselves to the study of recent Western peoples； anthropologists have found that to fully understand human behavior, all humans, past and present, must be studied."
5394,"不要再说任何其他特点,这种绝对独一无二的跨文化和长期的历史视角，使文化人类学与其他社会科学区别开来它为人类学提供了远比其他任何研究人类的学科更为丰富的数据库，它也可以应用于任何当前的问题。","More than any other feature, this unique cross-cultural and evolutionary perspective distinguishes cultural anthropology from the other social sciences.It provides anthropology with far richer data than those of any other social science, and it also can be applied to any current issue."
5394,作为一个适当的案例，让我们看一看，在美国，人们安排婴儿睡眠的风俗是：婴儿与其父母、特别是与其母亲分开睡。,"As a case in point, consider the way infants in the United States are routinely made to sleep apart from their parents, their mothers in particular."
5394,对大多数北美人来说，这可能是完全正常的，但是跨文化研究表明“一起睡”是一种普遍情况。,"To North Americans, this seems normal, but cross- cultural studies show that ""co-sleeping"" is the rule."
5395,虽然玛格丽特˙米德在20世纪30年代早期对三种不同社会中的性别和气质作了比较，是关于儿童养育对人格影响的大部分跨文化研究，是由比阿特丽斯·怀廷和欧文·L·柴尔德或他们的同事在最近做出的。,"Although Margaret Mead compared sex and temperament in three different societies in the early 1930s, most cross-cultural studies of child rearing effects on personality have been carried out more recently by John and Beatrice Whiting and Irving L. Child or their associates."
5395,他们的工作已经证明一些显著的规律。,Their work has demonstrated a number of apparent regularities.
5395,例如，我们有可能在广泛概括的层面上区分两种不同的儿童养育模式，为方便起见，我们可以把它们称为“依附训练”和“独立训练”。,"For example, it is possible to distinguish between two different patterns of child rearing at a broad level of generalization, which we may label for convenience ""dependence training"" and ""independence training""."
5396,也有人指出，外围区域——尤其是非洲、拉丁美洲和大部分亚洲地区——大部分为世界市场提供原材料，其价格由富裕国家的需求来决定。,"It has also been pointed out that the peripheral areas – notably Africa, Latin America and most of Asia – largely produce raw materials for the world market, at prices determined by the demand in the rich countries."
5396,这种受到马克思主义思想影响的理论，被叫做依靠理论，因为它强调了外围的贫困国家对富裕国家的根本依靠，以及后者对前者的剥削。,"This kind of theory, much of it influenced by Marxist thought, is called dependency theory, since it stresses the fundamental dependence of the peripheral, poor countries on the rich ones and the exploitation of the former by the latter."
5396,虽然它可以揭示很多问题，但总体上它是抽象的而且并不总是符合版图（Worsley 1984，1990）。,"Although it can be very revealing, it is general and abstract and does not always fit the territory (Worsley 1984, 1990)."
5397,就算是游牧民，他们的神话在人类学中也被认为可用环境来解释，他们所经过的熟悉的、古老的和适当的地方，不仅已经固定在记忆中，而且他们的财产也附着于这些地方，因为对他们来说，这个环境是永久的、循环的、标准的和传统的；在认知上，他们从未移动。,"Even if the subjects were nomads, their myths were regarded anthropologically as making of the environment through which they passed a known place, an old place, a proper place, not only fixed in memory but to which their belonging was stationary because permanent, cyclical, normative and traditional; cognitively, they never moved."
5397,就算研究对象不断处于日常时空之外的仪式过程——通过礼仪、朝圣、追求幻觉——并寻找他们生活的神圣中心（Eliade 1954: 12—20)，这些反结构事件实际上使他们进一步固定了中心；作为特殊的、非凡的、异常的经验，这些仪式只是强调了固定在社会环境中的日常身份，并赋予其合法性而已。,"And even if the subjects engaged in ritual journeys outside everyday space and time—rites of passage; pilgrimage; vision quests—in search of sacred centres to their lives (Eliade 1954:12–20), these anti- structural events served in fact to fix them even more; as special, extraordinary, aberrant experiences, the rituals merely emphasized and legitimated an everyday identity which derived from fixity in a social environment."
5397,仪式的主角利用他们（想象的）迁移的关键时刻来建立在平日里固定的面对周围世界的态度（参见：Yamba 1992)。,Ritual pilgrims used their moments of (imagined) movement to establish routinely fixed orientations to a world around them (cf. Yamba 1992).
5398,很可能这种差别的原因是由于各自的经验发现之间的差异。,It is very likely that this difference is caused by differences between the respective empirical findings.
5398,当然，这些相异点，似乎使建立一种仪式的总体理论变得更加复杂。,"Such dissimilarities, of course, seem to complicate even further the matter of building a general theory of ritual."
5398,不过，我们应该意识到，从拉帕波特的生态系统到利奇复杂的多层次分析，再到卡普费热和格尔茨所代表的解释学的方法，都赞同：仪式是从强烈的意识形态的维度对社会做出的一种迂回间接的复杂陈述。,"Nevertheless, we should be aware that from the system ecology of Rappaport, to the complex multi-level analysis of Leach, to the hermeneutic approach represented by Kapferer and Geertz, there is a clear continuity in that they all agree that ritual is an oblique, indirect way of making complex statements with a strong ideological dimension about society."
5398,通过对今天赞比亚的德布人的一些研究，维克多·特纳（Victor Turner 1967，1969，1974）建立了一个仪式符号论的复杂模型，该模型总结了许多其他人关注的要点。,"Through a number of studies of the Ndembu of present-day Zambia, Victor Turner (1967, 1969, 1974) has developed a sophisticated model of ritual symbolism, which sums up many of the concerns taken up by others."
5399,在比斯帕拉，贝利从事田野调査的1950年代，贾吉摩尼制度仍然或多或少是完整无缺的，但是某些影响因素已经从外部进入。,"In Bisipara, the jajmani system was still more or less intact when Bailey carried out his fieldwork in the 1950s, but some disturbing elements had entered from outside."
5399,这个村子已经被整合到现代印度国家，尤为显著地表现在重要的政治职业机会在当时已经可以提供给低级种姓的成员了。,"Notably, the village had been integrated into the modern Indian state in the sense that important political career opportunities were now available to members of the low castes."
5399,贝利描述了村子内部不同种类的政治冲突和竞争。我们将仔细观察以下两种：种姓攀升和种姓冲突。,"Bailey describes different kinds of political conflict and competition within the village, and we shall look more closely at two: caste-climbing and caste conflict."
5399,人们有三种可能的方式可以提髙他们的地位。,A person has three possible ways of improving his or her situation.
5399,他或她可以试图改变种姓身份（这在一个小村子里是极其困难的），试图提高他或她自己的种姓相对等级，或者抛弃整个种姓制度并试图在外面获得事业。,"He or she may try to change caste membership (which is exceedingly difficult in a small village), try to improve his or her own caste's relative rank, or dismiss the entire caste system and try to make a career outside it."
5399,几十年来，比斯帕拉的制酒者（distiller）已经稳步地提高了他们的经济地位，但这并没有使其仪式化洁净度也获得提高。,"The distiller caste in Bisipara had improved its economic condition steadily for decades, but this did not entail an improvement of its ritual purity."
5400,据目击这一仪式的人类学家布罗尼斯拉夫·马·林诺斯基说，这种仪式的同类相食，“是在极度的厌恶和恐惧中进行的，往往紧接着一阵狂吐。但同时，这又被认之为尊敬、爱和奉献的崇高行为”。,"This ritual cannibalism, witnessed by anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski, was performed with ""extreme repugnance and dread and usually followed by a violent vomiting fit. At the same time it is felt to be a supreme act of reverence, love and devotion""."
5400,这一习俗以及与 此相伴的种种情感，清楚地表明对于死亡的两可态度：一方面，活着的人渴望维持与死者的联系，而另一方面，他们又对因死亡引起的转变深感厌恶和恐惧。,"This custom and the emotions accompanying it clearly reveal the ambiguous attitude toward death: On the one hand, the survivors desire to maintain the tie to the dead person, and, on the other hand, they feel disgust and fear at the transformation wrought by death."
5400,在马林诺斯基看来，葬礼为个人表达这些情感提供了社会许可的集体手段，同时也维系了社会的凝聚力，防止社会发生断裂。,"According to Malinowski, funeral ceremonies provide an approved collective means for individuals to express these feelings while maintaining social cohesiveness and preventing disruption of society"
5401,这不仅仅是一个空间运动问题而且也是个时间问题：第一代移民和他那不说乌尔都语的孙子对于“穆斯林印度人”身份的定义是截然不同的。,This is not only a question of spatial movement but also of time: what defines the ‘Muslim Indian’ identity is rather different for a firstgeneration immigrant and for his grandson who does not speak Urdu.
5401,我们在此面对的是过渡身份。,
5401,,We are confronted here with transitional identities.
5401,这并不一定意味着，我们在朝着完全融入“主导性”群体前进，而意味着我们不能将相对定义明确的“少数者群体”概念作为我们分析的基础。,"This does not necessarily imply that we are heading towards full integration into the ‘dominant’ group, but that we cannot base our analysis on relatively well defined ‘minority groups’."
5402,最近大量出现的以族群（ethnicity)为焦点问题的自传作品似乎很难被传统上关于族群的社会学著作所容纳。,The recent proliferation of autobiographical works that take ethnicity as a focal puzzle seems to be poorly accommodated within the traditional sociological literature on ethnicity.
5402,像玛克辛˙洪˙金斯顿的《女战士》（Kingston 1976)，迈克尔˙阿伦的《亚拉腊山之行》(Arlern 1975)和玛丽塔˙戈尔登的《心灵的漂泊》（Golden 1983)，用群体的团结、传统价值、家庭的流动性、政治动员或其他类似的杜会学范畴来讨论难以充分地理解它们。,"Works such as Maxine Hong Kingston's The Woman Warrior (1976), Michael Arlen's Passage to Ararat (1975), and Marita Gulden's Migrations of the Heart (1983) are inadequately comprehended through discussions of group solidarit traditional values, family mobility, political mobilization, or similar sociological categories."
5402,以反叛家庭为主题的移民小说、异族通婚和文化同化与这些社会学概念更为相关。,"Immigrant novels of rebellion against the family, intermarriage, and acculturation are more relevant to these sociological conceptions."
5403,黑猩猩不是类人猿语言实验的唯一受试者。,Chimps have not been the only subjects of ape language experiments.
5403,人们也教大猩猩和猩猩北美式手势语，结果重现了在黑猩猩那里获得的那种成果。,Gorillas and orangutans also have been taught American Sign Language with results that replicate those obtained with chimps.
5403,因此，现在已产生了一种日趋扩大的共识:所有类人猿都可能获得起码达到2—3岁人类水平的语言技巧。,"As a consequence, there is now a growing consensus that all of the great apes can develop language skills at least to the level of a 2- to 3-year-old human."
5403,"不仅理解技术是相似的，而且获得语言技巧的顺序也是相似的：什么和什么地方，做什么和谁,以及怎么提问，类人猿和人都是以这个顺序获得语言能力的。","Not only are comprehension skills similar, but so is acquisition order: What and where, what-to-do and who, as well as how questions are acquired in that order by both apes and humans."
5403,"就像人一样，类人猿能够提到在时间和空间上分离的事件,这一现象被称为移位（displacement），是人类语言的独特特点之一。","Like humans, apes are capable of referring to events removed in time and space, a phenomenon known as displacement and one of the distinctive features of human language."
5404,亲属制度的一个更具有深远的重要性的维度是其司法制度：人类学有关亲属制度的大部分词汇来自罗马法（Roman Law）并非巧合。血浓于水，在世界的很多地方都这么说（虽然不是所有的地方），圣经上那个著名的浪子回头之后，迎接他的是父亲为他举办的盛宴。,"A further important dimension of the kinship institution is the judicial one: it is no coincidence that a large part of the anthropological kinship vocabulary derives from Roman law.Blood is thicker than water, it has been said in many parts of the world (though not everywhere), and the famous return of the biblical lost son was celebrated with a great feast."
5404,杀害兄弟和杀死父亲在世上的许多社会都被认为是所能想到的最严重的罪行，而父母也总是会对孩子们的婚姻大事进行干预——不论婚前婚后。,"Fratricide and patricide are considered the most serious crimes imaginable in many of the world's societies, and parents have always meddled in the marriages of their children – both before and after their consummation."
5404,这些几乎永久存在的问题与这样一个事实有关，那就是家族关系与遗产和继承密切相关。,These nearly perennial problems are tied to the fact that kinship is connected with inheritance and succession.
5404,这两种制度都与各种资源的代际传递有关。,Both institutions are to do with the transmission of resources from one generation to the next.
5405,这可能是为什么宗教总是人类学研究中的一个核心领域的主要原因所在，即使，如同埃文思-普里査德曾经指出的那样，社会科学家自己对于宗教往往是不感兴趣的甚或是敌对的。,"This may be a major reason why religion has always been a central field of inquiry in anthropology, even if, as Evans-Pritchard (1962) has pointed out, social scientists have themselves often been indifferent or hostile to religion."
5405,为了对政治、经济、自然、性别和其他一些核心概念试图做出无我族中心主义、比较有用的定义，常常出现的情况是，我们陷入通常与以下事实相关的问题：这些概念在我们自己的社会和人类学的词汇中被使用并具有特定的含义，但是，它们却并非也必然地存在于其他社会中，这使它们作为“主位的”概念是成问题的。,"In attempting to give non-ethnocentric, comparatively useful definitions of politics, economy, nature, gender and other core concepts, it has repeatedly been shown that we run into problems usually related to the fact that these notions are in use, and have a specific meaning, in our own society and in the anthropological vocabulary, but not necessarily in other societies.This makes them problematic as ""etic"" concepts."
5405,对于宗教而言，这些问题也同样存在，而且很少有社会科学的概念比这个概念更频繁地被定义、修正和批判。,"This problem is certainly valid where religion is concerned, and few concepts of social science have been defined, revised and criticised more often than this one."
5405,大约只比一个世纪之前更早一点，在专业文献中，一方面区分宗教和异教信仰（paganism），一方面区分宗教和迷信是很常见的做法。,"Only a little more than a century ago, it was commonplace in the professional literature to distinguish between religion and paganism on the one hand, and religion and superstition on the other."
5406,此外，即使是科学的民族志作者也不能完全控制由他们的报告引起的意义——理解（readings）。,"Moreover, even scientific ethnographers cannot fully control the meanings—readings—provoked by their accounts."
5406,这尤其符合那些没有将其对象历史化的表述，它们在一种“民族志的当前”(事实上总是过去）描绘异域社会。,"This is especially true o f representations that have not historicized their objects, portraying exotic societies in an ""ethnographic present"" (which is always, in fact, a past)."
5406,这种共时性的悬置有效地将他者文本化，在一种既不在时间的流动中，也不在同样暧昧不明、变动的历史的当前创造出一种真实感，这种真实感包括并定位了他者、民族志作者和读者。,"This synchronic suspension effectively textualizes the other, and gives the sense of a reality not in temporal flux, not in the same ambiguous, moving historical present that includes and situates the other, the ethnographer, and the reader."
5406,用约翰尼斯˙费边的话说，“异时的”表述已经弥漫在20世纪的科学民族志里，它们用罗萨尔多所反对的神话化方式鼓励寓言性的挪用。,"""Allochronic"" representations, to use Johannes Fabian's term, have been pervasive in twentieth-century scientific ethnography.They invite allegorical appropriations in the mythologizingmode Rosaldo repudiates."
5407,自从热内·笛卡尔（Rene Descartes（1596-1650））提出那个著名的纯粹我思：“我思故我在”，意识就成为现代哲学关注的对象。,Consciousness has been of modern philosophical concern since René Descartes (1596–1650) formulated what became known as the cogito: ‘I think therefore I am’.
5407,之后，哲学的重心从宇宙转移到个体的人；控制人行动的力量和个体内心的宿命感，以及先前感受到的内在于外部世界的精神生活和精神活动的观念——上帝、行星、药草、诙谐、教堂仪式——这些都越来越减弱了。,"Thereafter, the centre of philosophical gravity shifted from the cosmos to the individual human being; forces which controlled human behaviour and destiny were felt to arise more and more from within the individual, while belief in the spiritual life and activity previously felt to be immanent in the world outside—gods, planets, herbs, humours, church ritual—grew feebler."
5407,哲学家开始从思考自身出发由内而外地进行研究，而非由外而内地从宇宙研究到灵魂；约翰·洛克（John Locke（1632-1704））采用了一个新词汇“意识”来指称“在个体的脑中经历的感知”。,Philosophers began to work outwards from the thinking self rather than inwards from the cosmos to the soul; and John Locke (1632–1704) adopted the new word ‘consciousness” to mean: “perception of what passes in an individual’s own mind’.
5407,意识逐步被看作是人的行动、社会、语言和知识的基础。,"Consciousness came to be seen as fundamental to human behaviour, society, language and knowledge."
5408,比如，许多人类群体在成年以后缺乏乳糖酶，这是消化牛奶所必需的一种酶。,"For example, many human groups when adult lack the enzyme lactase, which is necessary for digesting milk."
5408,根据这个标准，北欧人应该和阿拉伯人以及一些西非人归为一类，比如富拉尼人；而南欧人属于大多数非洲人和东亚人那一边。,"Following this criterion, North Europeans must be classified together with Arabs and some West African peoples such as the Fulani, while South Europeans belong with most Africans and East Asians."
5408,按照外貌特征，将人类区分为不同种族是武断的，从科学上说也是无趣的，因而对人种的研究属于政治和意识形态的人类学，而不是文化差异的范围。,"The classification of humanity into races, based on physical appearance, is arbitrary and scientifically uninteresting.The study of race thus belongs to the anthropology of power and ideology, not to the area of cultural variation."
5408,需要补充的是，许多具有生物学倾向的人类学家现在打着“进化心理学”的旗号（Barkow et al. 1992），他们更容易被人类群体之间的共同点而不是不同点所打动。,"It should be added that biologically oriented anthropologists, many of them nowadays flying the banner ""evolutionary psychology"" (Barkow et al. 1992), tend to be more struck by the similarities than by the differences between human groups."
5409,他认为，亲属称谓是保守的，反映的是古代的、常常是已消失的社会事实。,"Being conservative, he argued, terminology tends to reflect ancient, and often extinct, social facts."
5409,所以，亲属称谓可以用作一种语言考古学，以便理解社会组织的历史变化。,Thus it could be used as a kind of linguistic archaeology in order to understand historical changes in social organization.
5409,这正是摩尔根曾经做过的研究 ( Morgan 1877 ) 。,This is precisely what Morgan (1877) had done.
5409,虽然里弗斯已经宣布他皈依了传播论， 但在这里他代表了古典进化论者的终结观点；而他的学生拉德克利夫－布朗以否定臆测历史重要性为基础的新研究则将浮出水面。,"Rivers here represented the last of the classic evolutionists, though he had in fact already announced his conversion to diffusionism; and his student, Radcliffe-Brown, was on the verge of a new approach based on a denial of the importance of conjectural history."
5410,这正是因为许多人类学家认为因果模式不足以理解人类思想转变的关系。,It was precisely because many anthropologists considered a causal model inadequate for understanding this relationship that the shift in thinking occurred.
5410,社会与文化体系一旦被当作由机能部分构成的机器似的实体，则会被认为是人类活动的因果产品，是“集体选择的统计结果”（Leach 1960:124)。,"Social and cultural systems, once treated asmachi ties composed of functioning parts, came to be seen as the emergent products of human activity, ""the statistical outcome of multiple individual choices"" (Leach 1960:124)."
5410,这个新范式中选择的重要性使因果关系不再是一个适合的分析概念。,Thecentral importance of choice in this new paradigm made causality an inappropriate analytical concept.
5410,做出选择是为了可能实现的目标而不是因为特殊条件在起作用（见Stuchlik 1977)。,"Choices are made, it was assumed, in order that goals might be achieved and not because  certain conditions prevail (see Stuchlik 1977)."
5411,类似的，人类学已从族群科学多样化的论断开始转向提倡研究人类认知结构中的普遍性规则，包括个体或个人、自我与他者、相关性和因果性、认知与分类、叙述以及空间和时间（Sperber 1985）。,"Similarly, from assertions of ethnoscientific diversity, anthropology has moved to an appreciation of underlying, universal principles in human cognitive structurings of the individual or person, of self and other, of relationships and causality, of recognition and classification, of narration, and of space and time (cf. Sperber 1985)."
5411,这并不是说人们的认知之间的差异不大（实际上，变化着的差异正是人们认知中唯一恒久和统一的特点）。,"This is not to say that people will not differ vastly in their cognitions; (indeed, transformative differences may represent the only permanency and sameness in human cognition)."
5411,但是这个差异的逻辑是共同的、属人的，而不是文化或特例性的。,But the logic of difference is a common and human rather than cultural and particular issue.
5412,阴性书写（Ecriture feminine），或“女性书写”，是露丝·伊丽格瑞（Luce Irigaray 1985）提出的一个术语，指的是女性的象征性表述这一概念，能够克服当前语言结构中的霸权，这一霸权结构不仅是阳性的，而且是绝对男权主义和族长制的，特别是使女性的表述处于默默无闻的境地。,"Ecriture feminine, or ‘women’s writing’, is a term coined by Luce Irigaray (1985) to convey a notion of female symbolic expression which can overcome a hegemony in current linguistic structures which is not just masculine but positively phallocentric and patriarchal, and which renders specifically female expression silent."
5412,经过伊丽格瑞、埃莱娜·西苏（Helene Cixous 1990）、朱丽娅·克里斯蒂瓦（Julia Kristeva 1984）等人的发展，这一概念迅速混合了语言学和心理分析学的理论。,"As employed by Irigaray, and by the likes of Hélène Cixous (1990) and Julia Kristeva (1984), the concept amounts to a heady concoction of linguistics and psychoanalysis."
5412,关于生物决定论或是女性表述中的本质主义的范围，她们尚未达成总体上的一致见解，但有一点是相同的，即在身体上的特征：“在爱与恨这一经典的对立之外……存在着一个半开放的区域，由那些二分法中十分陌生的嘴唇组成”（Irigaray 1993）。,"There is no overall agreement between the above on the extent of biological determinism or essentialism in female experience, but all draw upon its bodily nature: ‘[B]eyond the classic opposites of love and hate…lies this perpetually half-open threshold, consisting of lips that are strangers to dichotomy’ (Irigaray 1993)."
5413,语言人类学提供了这一观点一个最引人注目的例子——音素。,Linguistic anthropology offers one of the most striking examples of this: the phoneme.
5413,音素是对交流至关重要的声音的一个特征。,The phoneme is a feature of sound that is crucial for communication.
5413,对比一下不同人说话的方式，即便是那些讲同一种语言并有相同口音的人，你也可以从中听到各种各样的变异。,"If you compare the way different people talk, even those who speak the same language and have the same ""accent,"" you can hear all kinds of variations."
5413,发言人会使用不同的音高、音量、音质、重音和呼吸模式。,"Speakers use different pitch, volume, tone quality, stress, and patterns of breathing."
5414,1954年，美国语言学家肯尼斯•派克发表了他的一篇长达762页的文章中的第一部分，文章的题目是《语言及人类行为结构的统一理论》（1976年最后完成，见Pike 1976)。这是一次伟大的突破。,American linguist Kenneth L. Pike made a great breakthrough in 1954 when he published the first part of an essay of 762 pages called Language in Relation to a Unified Theory of the Structure of Human Behavior (completed as Pike 1967).
5414,"他提出“声音” （sounds，the phonetic，语音）和“声音的意义单 位”（meaningful unit of sound，the phonemic,音位）之间是有关系的主张，并且认为“任何种类的单位”（the etic，音素/客位）和“任何种类的有意义的单位”（the emic，音位/主位）之间都有广泛的联系。",He took the idea of the relation between sounds (the phonetic) and meaningful units of sound (the phonemic) and postulated a more general relation between units of any kind (the etic) and meaningful units of any kind (the emic).
5415,音位/主位是在某种语言或文化中有意义区别的层次。,The emic is the level of meaningful contrasts within a particular language or culture.
5415,我们可以根据许多框架（framework)和格栅（grid)来解释音位/主位的特征。,We can explain emic distinctions in terms of various frameworks or grids.
5415,最典型的例子包括：林奈氏分类系统、医学中疾病、光波长度的测量、音乐中半音音阶的衡量，还有最重要的谱系的格栅。,"Classic examples include Linnaean taxonomy; disease, in medical science; the measurement of the wavelength of light; the chromatic scale in music; and above all, the genealogical grid."
5416,第二类辅助语言的声音是由发嗓音（vocalizations）构成的。,The second kind of paralinguistic noises consists of vocalizations.
5416,这些嗓音是实际可辨别的声音，而不是基本特点。与音质不同，它们是在可觉察的和相对短的音程中出现和消失的。,"Rather than background characteristics, these are actual identifiable noises that, unlike voice qualities, are turned on and off at perceivable and relatively short intervals."
5416,但是它们与语言的语音是分开的。,"They are, nonetheless, separate from language sounds."
5416,发嗓音的一个类别是嗓音特征表露（vocal characterizes）：笑或哭，喊叫或低语，打哈欠或打哺等声音。,"One category of vocalizations is vocal characterizers: the sounds of laughing or crying, yelling or whispering, yawning or belching, and the like."
5417,通常，但并不总是，母系社会中，会存在一个“苛刻的舅舅”。,"The 'severe uncle' usually, but not always, appears in matrilineal societies."
5417,列维-斯特劳斯的观点很复杂，而且从理论和经验上都涵盖了很多领域。,"Lévi-Strauss's argument is complex and covers much ground, both theoretically and empirically."
5417,我们在之前关于继嗣和联盟的相关讨论中的一个重要观点却仍然是他的思路中所蕴涵的一个重要脉络：群体之间的联盟比人们之间共同的血缘关系更为根本。,"An important point, pertinent to the earlier discussion about descent and alliances, is nevertheless that his line of thought implies that alliances between groups are more fundamental than shared descent."
5417,因此，姻亲成为理解社会整合的一把万能钥匙。,Affinality is thus a universal key to the understanding of the integration of society.
5418,我们离开纳亚尔人之前，需要指出的是，在他们的社会，没有任何东西是与北美社会的已知家庭类似的这一点很重要。,"Before we leave the Nayar, it is important to note that nothing in this society is comparable to the family as we know it in North America."
5418,"形成家户的群体不包括姻亲(affinal kin),即由婚姻建立夫妻关系(conjugal bond)所加入的那些个人。","The group that forms the household does not include affinal kin, or individuals joined by a conjugal bond established by marriage."
5418,就如在第九章我们将证明的，家户并不非得是像我们所知道的那种家庭。,"As will be shown in Chapter 9, a household group does not have to be a family as we know it."
5418,在纳亚尔人中，家户完全是由我们通常所谓的“血缘”亲属组成的，“血缘”亲属技术上被称为血亲（consanguineal kin)。,"Among the Nayar the household is composed wholly of what we often call“blood”relatives,l:echnicallyknownascon- sanguineal kin."
5418,性关系是与非血亲、因此而住在另一个家户的那些人的关系。,Sexual relations are with those who are not consanguineal kin and thus live in other households.
5419,如果不假设我们已经进入了一个由文化建构的独立世界，如果不假设并不是所有的知识都是由社会决定的，那么就不可能这么说。,"It would not be possible to say this without assuming that we have access to a world independent of cultural construction, that not all knowledge is socially determined."
5419,相同的文化观点可以用道格拉斯关于《旧约》 中的饮食法则来解释（《圣经一申命记》第十四章，《圣经一利未记》第十一章）。,"The same point can be illustrated using Douglas' analysis of the dietary laws listed in the Old Testament (Deuteronomy, chapter 14 and Leviticus, chapter 11)."
5419,在众多的物种中，（耶和华）规定人们不允食用猪肉，因为猪肉是不洁净的。,"Pigs, among other species, were not allowed to be eaten because they were seen as unclean."
5419,根据道格拉斯的分析，原因是猪仅仅拥有可食动物的一个特征——猪是分趾类动物，但它却不反刍。,"The reason for this, according to Douglas, was that they only possess one of the features which identified animals as edible—they have cloven feet, but they do not chew the cud."
5419,因此，它跨越了分趾、反刍（因而是可食用的）类动物与其他动物之间的边界。,"Thus, pigs straddle the boundary between clovenfooted, cud-chewing (and therefore edible) animals and the rest."
5419,不许食用猪肉的禁忌保护了这些文化分类（Douglas 1966)。,The prohibition against eating pork served to protect these culturalcategories (Douglas 1966).
5420,也可以说，有些环保组织对文化差异性十分敏感。,It should also be said that some environmental organizations have been sensitive to cultural differences.
5420,从1986 年世界自然基金会（WWF)发起一场通过宗教教义的多样性来提高环保意识的运动起，世界五大宗教（佛教、基督教、印度教、伊斯兰教和犹太教）的领袖便汇集于阿西西（Assisi，译注：意大利中部的一个城市），发表了他们保护环境的联合声明（WWF 1986，Beyer 1994:209)。,"From 1986, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) ran a campaign to promote environmental awareness through diverse religious doctrines.Leaders of five world religions, Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam and Judaism, met in Assisi to declare their commitment to conservation (WWF 1986, Beyer 1994:209)."
5420,在其后的两年内，巴哈依教（Baha’i，译者注：波斯泛神教的一个教派）和塞克教（Sikh)的领导人也加入了这一运动（WWF 1988)。,"Within two years, Baha'i and Sikh leaders had also joined the initiative (WWF 1988)."
5421,历史语言学在确定不同语言之间的谱系关系方面已经取得巨大成就，这些成就反映在分类图表之中。,"Historical linguists have achieved considerable success working out the genealogical relationships between different languages, and these are reflected in classification schemes."
5421,例如，英语是归类在印欧语系语（参见 图4.2）中约140种语言中的一种。,"For example, English is one of a number of languages classified in the Indo-European language family (Figure 4.2)."
5421,这一语族又分为11个语言亚族，这就反映了这一事实:从一种古代统一的语言（指原始印欧语）向独立的“女儿”语言的语言趋异（linguistic divergence）要经历很长一个时期（约6000年左右）。,"This family is subdivided into 11 subgroups, which reflect the long period (8,000 years or so) of linguistic divergence from an ancient unified language (referred to as Proto-Indo-European) into separate ""daughter"" languages."
5421,英语是日尔曼语亚族(参见图4.3)中几种语言的一种，这几种语言之间的相互关系比它们与印欧语系语族的其他亚族的关系更为紧密。,English is one of a number of languages in the Germanic subgroup (Figure 4.3)； all are more closely related to one another than to the languages of any other subgroup of the Indo-European family.
5422,在他对社会过程的描述中，戈夫曼使用了剧场词句，如演员、角色和表演，并且区分了前台和后台。,"In his descriptions of social processes, Goffman uses expressions from the theatre.He talks of actors, roles and performances, and distinguishes between the frontstage and the backstage."
5422,他这么做的要点在于指出：有一些是我们熟练支配和感到相对安全的情境，就像在后台化妆间的演员，能够“真正是他们自己”，开开玩笑、表露他们的真实情感、从舞台角色的严格要求中解脱出来。,"His point in doing so is that there are situations we master well and feel relatively secure in, as when the (literal) actors, in their backstage dressing-rooms, can ""truly be themselves"", make jokes, display their true emotions and feel free of the strict requirements of their roles on stage."
5422,相反，在前台，印象管理变得重要：演员不得不自觉地意识到他或她给别人所造成的印象，并努力用自己所希望的方式去塑造它。,"In the frontstage area, on the contrary, impression management becomes important: the actor has to be self-consciously aware of the impression he or she makes on others, and tries to shape it in the desired ways."
5422,这种情境，就像一个正式的会面，或另一种因为你缺乏对角色的完全掌控而感到有点不自在的情境，你会努力用某种方式表现自己，也就是戈夫曼所谓的印象管理。,"In this kind of situation, as in a formal interview or another kind of situation where one feels slightly uncomfortable for lack of complete mastery of the role, one will contrive to appear in a specific way through what Goffman calls impression management."
5423,此外，20 世纪 50 年代所听到的“英国结构主义者 ” 这个词， 是要将拉德克利夫－布朗的思想同列维－斯特劳斯的思想或称“法国结构主义”区别开（在第八 章中叙述）。,"Furthermore, the term ‘British structuralist’ was heard in the 1950s to distinguish Radcliffe-Brownianism from Lévi-Straussianism or ‘French structuralism’ (described in chapter 8)."
5423,令人不解的是，20 世纪 60 年代初，新一代英国人类学家开始转向列维－斯特劳斯，他们给他们自己戴上了“英国结构主义者”的标签。,"Confusingly, when in the early 1960s a new generation of British anthropologists turned to Lévi-Strauss, they assumed the label ‘British structuralist’ for themselves."
5423,从广义上说，后来这个“英国结构主义”实际上是“法国结构主义”的英国版！,"In broader terms, the latter ‘British structuralism’ was actually a British version of ‘French structuralism’!"
5424,英人类学的研究领域缘起于学术世界的边缘，当时学术界认为其他主题远比研究人类社会和文化多样性更重要和更有趣。,The field of study that became British anthropology arose on the fringes of a scholarly world that regarded other topics as far more important and interesting than the study of human social and cultural diversity.
5424,当时它所面临的学术界似乎极不愿意把它作为学术机构内值得探索的一系列专业学科之中的亲密一员来欢迎。,It faced an academic establishment that seems to have been most reluctant to welcome it as a bona fide discipline within the range of academic specialties worth pursuing in scholarly institutions.
5424,在这种情况下，对英国人类学传统的叙述不能仅限于那些关于学者们如何在学术思想、创新和正统观念上相互较劲的内部故事：我们必须还要考虑在学者们所处的较大的社会环境中普遍存在着的那些令他们不得不受其影响的兴趣和偏见，以及他们在学术生活中所能接触到的、帮助他们实现研究目标的具体组织和资源。,"Under such circumstances, an account of the British tradition of anthropology cannot be restricted to an internal story of scholars wrestling each other over intellectual ideas, innovations, and orthodoxies: we must also take account of the interests and prejudices that prevailed in the larger society, to which these scholars had to accommodate, and of the particular organizations and resources in academic life that were available to them as the means of pursuing their goals."
5425,虽然在当代世界一夫一妻制和一夫多妻制是最普遍的婚姻形式，但是也有其他的婚姻形式存在，尽管很少见。,"Although monogamy and polygyny are the most common forms of marriage in the world today, other forms do occur, however rarely."
5425,一妻多夫制（polyandry），即一个女子同时与两个或多个男子的婚姻，只在儿个社会中见到，部分原因或许是男子的预期寿命比女子的短，而且男婴的死亡率高，所以在一个社会中男子过剩是不大可能的。,"Polyandry, the marriage of one woman to two or more men simultaneously, is known in only a few societies, perhaps in part because men's life expectancy is shorter than women's, and male infant mortality is high, so a surplus of men in a society is unlikely."
5425,在性别 比例平衡的地方，如在拉达克人的社会中，许多妇女可能一直不结婚。,"Where sex ratios are balanced, as in Ladakh, many women are likely to remain unmarried."
5425,一妻多夫制少见的另一个原因，是这种婚姻形式比任何其他形式更加限制一个男子的后代。,Another reason for polyandry rarity is that it limits a man's descendants more than any other pattern.
5425,然而，在纳亚尔人中，一妻多夫制使女子怀孕的机会最大化，确保其继嗣群体孩子的生育。,
5426,在20世纪，应用人类学的范围扩大了。,"In the present century, the scope of applied anthropology has broadened."
5426,20世纪早期，弗朗兹˙博厄斯在美国几乎单枪匹马地训练了一代人类学家，帮助改革美国的移民政策。,"Early on, the applied work of Franz Boas, who almost single-handedly trained a generation of anthropologists in the United States, was instrumental in reforming the country immigration policies."
5426,30年代，带着非常明确的实际目的的人类学家，对美国的工业环境和制度环境做了相尚多的研究。,"In the 1930s, anthropologists with avowedly applied goals did a number of studies in industrial and other institutional settings in the United States."
5426,随着第二次世界大战的到来，首次尝试由受过人类学训练的官员来管理美国疆土之外(尤其是太平洋上）的殖民地。,"With World War II came the first efforts at colonial administration beyond U.S. borders, especially in the Pacific, by officers trained in anthropology."
5426,日本的迅速复苏在很大程度上归功于人类学家在安排美国军事占领中的影响。,The rapid recovery of Japan was due in no small measure to the influence of anthropologists on structuring the U.S. occupation.
5427,米德以及她同时代的其他人类学家的观点是关于文化可变性的基本经验。,"Mead's point, and that of other anthropologists of her time, was the fundamental lesson of cultural variability."
5427,虽然弗里曼和其他一些现代批评家对它们进行了残酷的歪曲，但这仍是整个20世纪的人类学家们不得不一次又一次重新关注的：从博厄斯的圈子对纳粹关于种族和优生学观点的回应，到种族主义主张在像《钟曲线》（Herrnstein and Murray 1994)这样的书中的多次重现，再到作为族群暴力借口的“文化”这一概念的滥用。,"It was cruelly distorted by Freeman and some other latter-day critics, but it is a message that anthropologists have had to return to again and again throughout the twentieth century: from the responses of Boas's circle to Nazi ideas about race and eugenics, to the multiple reappearances of racialist claims in books like The Bell Curve (Herrnstein and Murray, 1994), to the misuses of ""culture"" as justification for ethnic violence."
5427,人类学的这一职责至今仍然伴随着我们。,This task for anthropology is still with us.
5428,其他学者展示了这些发挥作用的过程。,Other scholars have demonstrated these processes at work.
5428,如南希·利斯·斯捷潘(Nancy Leys Stepan)在她关于拉丁美洲优生运动的书中，研究了后殖民社会（1920—1930年）的巴西、墨西哥和阿根廷天主教社会优生的含义，那时，新民族诞生于不同种类的人群。,"Nancy Leys Stepan, for example, in her book on the eugenics movement in Latin America investigates the particular meanings of eugenics in the Catholic, post-colonial societies of Brazil, Mexico and Argentina in the 1920s and 1930s, when new nations were being constituted out of heterogeneous populations."
5428,优生学家在建构民族群体中的融入和排斥概念方面发挥着作用，赋予民族群体种族的、有性别差异的认同。,"Eugenicists played a part in structuring notions of inclusion and exclusion in national bodies, giving that body its ethnic and gendered identity."
5429,这种思维方式，在我们的文化中的许多方面都可谓是根深蒂固。,This way of thinking is embedded in our culture from many sources.
5429,它存在于我们的语言中：我们的语言（不同于许多非欧洲语言）有时态，它把人的体验划分成过去、现在和未来。,"It is in our language, which, unlike many non-European languages, has tense;it categorizes experience in past, present, and future."
5429,它存在于我们的犹太一基督教宗教传统中：这一传统想象我们有一个历史——一个始于遥远的过去，从创世记经由亚伯拉罕、摩西和先知一直到现在的进步——和一个未来。,"It is in our Judeo-Christian religious tradition, which imagines that we have a history – a past progressing from the creation of the world through Abraham, Moses, and the prophets – and a future."
5430,新教传统强调，是个体自身，作为一个独立单位，遭受天谴被罚人地狱永远受苦，或是得到拯救升入天堂享受极乐。,"Protestant Christian tradition emphasizes that it is the individual self, as an independent unit, which is damned to eternal suffering in hell or saved for eternal bliss in heaven."
5430,其他重点也存在于其他宗教中，例如，在早期犹太教中，上帝给予惩罚或奖励的是国家。,"Other emphases are present in other religions; for example, in early Judaism it was the nation that God punished or rewarded."
5430,一个人有投票表决权，是美国民主的一个规则，但像20世纪早期的日本就不是这样，在那里是户主代表所有家庭成员进行投票。,"One person, one vote is the rule in American democracy, but not, say, in early-twentieth-century Japan, where it was the household head who voted, representing the household group."
5431,他的著作中处处都强调有意识的主体和能动性所发挥的作用，而他的反对者则批评他的这一思想是“主观性”的观点。,"Everywhere in his work he emphasized the role of conscious agents or actors—an emphasis which his opponents were inclined to criticize as the ""subjective"" point of view."
5431,然而人是他人行为的对象而非主体，因此非主体的人符合了社会信息系统的各项标准。,"It is persons as the objects of the actions of others, however, not as subjects, that meet his criteria for sociological data."
5431,兹纳涅茨基在这些信息的来源中列举了社会学家的个人经验——这种经验既有原初的又有从他人经验中间接获得的；社会学家的直接的和间接的观察；其他人的个人经验及其观察。,"Among the sources of these data Znaniecki listed the personal experiences of the sociologist, both original and vicarious; observation by the sociologist, both direct and indirect; the personal experience of other people; and the observations of other people."
5432,自从热内·笛卡尔（Rene Descartes（1596-1650））提出那个著名的纯粹我思：“我思故我在”，意识就成为现代哲学关注的对象。,Consciousness has been of modern philosophical concern since René Descartes (1596–1650) formulated what became known as the cogito: ‘I think therefore I am’.
5432,之后，哲学的重心从宇宙转移到个体的人；控制人行动的力量和个体内心的宿命感，以及先前感受到的内在于外部世界的精神生活和精神活动的观念——上帝、行星、药草、诙谐、教堂仪式——这些都越来越减弱了。,"Thereafter, the centre of philosophical gravity shifted from the cosmos to the individual human being; forces which controlled human behaviour and destiny were felt to arise more and more from within the individual, while belief in the spiritual life and activity previously felt to be immanent in the world outside—gods, planets, herbs, humours, church ritual—grew feebler."
5432,哲学家开始从思考自身出发由内而外地进行研究，而非由外而内地从宇宙研究到灵魂；约翰·洛克（John Locke（1632-1704））采用了一个新词汇“意识”来指称“在个体的脑中经历的感知”。,Philosophers began to work outwards from the thinking self rather than inwards from the cosmos to the soul; and John Locke (1632–1704) adopted the new word‘consciousness’ to mean: ‘perception of what passes in an individual’s own mind’.
5432,意识逐步被看作是人的行动、社会、语言和知识的基础。,"Consciousness came to be seen as fundamental to human behaviour, society, language and knowledge."
5433,新弗洛伊德主义：比较不同社会中的童年，有时从很大的数据量中取样，来检验弗洛伊德的假设，即成年人的性格是童年中冲突的反映（Erikson 1977）。,"Neo-Freudianism: Childhood practices in different societies have been compared, sometimes in large numbers (Whiting and Child 1953), in terms of Freudian assumptions concerning the way adult character is a reflection of childhood conflicts (cf. Erikson 1977)."
5433,杜·波伊斯（Du Bois 1944）经过进一步的研究指出，埃勒人中母亲对年幼儿童的忽视造成了埃勒成年人在情感上的浅薄、怀疑和不稳定，一个民间传说加强了成年人和儿童之间的这种挫折感和憎恨以及怀疑神性的宇宙观。,"In an extended study, Du Bois (1944) argued that maternal neglect of young children on Alor was responsible for affective shallowness, suspicion and instability among Alorese adults, for a folklore which stressed adult-child frustrations and hatred, and a cosmology of suspect deities."
5433,"类似的，斯皮罗（Spiro 1958, 1982）把弗洛伊德理论引入到对特罗布里恩德岛人和克布兹人的童年研究中。","Spiro similarly introduced Freud into Trobriand and kibbutz childhoods (1958, 1982)."
5434,另一种促使语言变化的广泛力量是语言民族主义（linguistic nationalism)， 整个国家通过把“外国的”术语从他们自己的词汇中清除出去，以显示其独立的一种努力。,"One other far-reaching force for linguistic change is linguistic nationalism, an attempt by-whole countries to proclaim their independence by purging their vocabularies of ""foreign"" terms."
5434,这种现象尤其是今天非洲和亚洲的前殖民地国家所特有的。,This phenomenon is particularly characteristic of the former colonial countries of Africa and Asia today.
5434,然而，这绝不限于这呰国家，因为人们可以看到法国人周期性地从他们的语言中清除诸如“汉堡包”等美语用法。,"It is by no means limited to those countries, however, as shown by periodic French attempts to purge their language of such Americanisms as le hamburger."
5434,在语言民族主义范畴内，还有长期以来从少数族群、有时甚至从整个国家的共同用法中产生的语言复活（估计有6000种语言已经在过去500年里消失了）。,"Also in the category of linguistic nationalism are revivals of languages long out of common use, by ethnic minorities and sometimes even whole countries."
5435,历史语言学在确定不同语言之间的谱系关系方面已经取得巨大成就，这些成就反映在分类图表之中。,"Historical linguists have achieved considerable success working out the genealogical relationships between different languages, and these are reflected in classification schemes."
5435,例如，英语是归类在印欧语系语（参见图4.2）中约140种语言中的一种。,"For example, English is one of a number of languages classified in the Indo-European language family (Figure 4.2)."
5435,这一语族又分为11个语言亚族，这就反映了这一事实：从一种古代统一的语言（指原始印欧语）向独立的“女儿”语言的语言趋异（linguistic divergence）要经历很长一个时期（约6000年左右）。,"This family is subdivided into 11 subgroups, which reflect the long period (8,000 years or so) of linguistic divergence from an ancient unified language (referred to as Proto-Indo-European) into separate ""daughter"" languages."
5435,英语是日尔曼语亚族（参见图4.3）中几种语言的一种，这几种语言之间的相互关系比它们与印欧语系语族的其他亚族的关系更为紧密。,English is one of a number of languages in the Germanic subgroup (Figure 4.3); all are more closely related to one another than to the languages of any other subgroup of the Indo-European family.
5436,文化人类学可以划分为考古学、语言人类学和民族学（通常被称为社会文化人类学，参见图l.l）。,"Although the findings of cultural anthropologists often have challenged the conclusions of sociologists, psychologists, and economists, anthropology is absolutely indispensable to them, as it is the only consistent check against culture-bound assertions."
5436,虽然每个分支有自己的专业兴趣和方法，但它们都研究文化资料。,Anthropology is to these disciplines what the laboratory is to physics and chemistry: the essential testing ground for their theories.
5436,考古学家、语言学家和民族学家对研究主题采取不同的研究方式，但是，它们每一学科都捜集和分析有助于说明人类文化相似性和差异性的数据，以及在任何地方不同文化发展、调适和持续变迁的方式。,"Cultural anthropology may be divided into the areas of archaeology, linguistic anthropology, and ethnology (often called sociocultural anthropology; Figure 1.1)."
5437,另一类别的发嗓音是由语音修饰（vocal qualifiers）构成的。,Another category of vocalizations consists of vocal qualifiers.
5437,有一种比嗓音特征表露更短暂的音延，一般限于单个语调空隙里，而不是遍及整条短语。,"These are of briefer duration than vocal characterizers, limited generally to the space of a single intonation, rather than over whole phrases.They modify utterances in terms of intensity—loud versus soft; pitch—high versus low; and extent—drawl versus clipping."
5437,它们根据强度音的响亮与柔和、音调的高与低、迟缓与快速来修饰话语这些表示说话人对诸如“滚出去”这类特殊短语的态度。,"These indicate the speaker's attitude toward specific phrases, such as ""Get out!"""
5437,第三类别是由发声间隔（vocal segregates) 构成的。,The third category consists of vocal segregates.
5438,历史语言学在确定不同语言之间的谱系关系方面已经取得巨大成就，这些成就反映在分类图表之中。,"Historical linguists have achieved considerable success working out the genealogical relationships between different languages, and these are reflected in classification schemes."
5438,例如，英语是归类在印欧语系语（参见图4.2）中约140种语言中的一种。,"For example, English is one of a number of languages classified in the Indo-European language family (Figure 4.2)."
5438,这一语族又分为11个语言亚族，这就反映了这一事实：从一种古代统一的语言（指原始印欧语）向独立的“女儿”语言的语言趋异（linguistic divergence）要经历很长一个时期（约6000年左右），英语是日尔曼语亚族（参见图4.3）中几种语言的一种，这几种语言之间的相互关系比它们与印欧语系语族的其他亚族的关系更为紧密。,"This family is subdivided into 11 subgroups, which reflect the long period (8,000 years or so) of linguistic divergence from an ancient unified language (referred to as Proto-Indo-European) into separate ""daughter"" languages.English is one of a number of languages in the Germanic subgroup (Figure 4.3); all are more closely related to one another than to the languages of any other subgroup of the Indo-European family."
5439,特纳延续了范·盖内普将仪式分为三阶段的做法：分离、阈限 （liminality）和再融合。,"Turner follows van Gennep in dividing the rites into three phases: separation, liminality and reintegration."
5439,分离的特征是个人或群体从社会结构中的一个固定点离开朝向某个未知的事物。,Separation is characterised by the individual's or group's movement away from a fixed point in social structure towards something unknown.
5439,当这种突破行为被完成，行动者就进入了阈限阶段，这是一个模糊的发展进程，某种意义上说，他或她置身于社会之外，在两种稳定状态之间“悬而未决，模棱两可”（Turner 1969)。,"When the breach is completed, the agent enters a liminal phase, an ambiguous stage where he or she is in a certain sense placed outside society, ""betwixt and between"" (Turner 1969) two stable conditions."
5439,这将行动者置于了一个危险的境地。,This puts the actor in a dangerous position.
5439,社会所承担的风险是，行动者拒绝被融合并且抛弃了社会的价值和权力等级。而行动者个人所冒的风险是个人失范状态和没有社会归属。,"Society runs the risk that the actor refuses to be reintegrated and rejects its values and power hierarchies, while the individual for his or her part risks anomie and social homelessness."
5439,特纳写道，几乎在每个社会，处在阈限阶段的人“按照他的文化的标准定义和分类法，即便不是身体上，从结构上看也是隐形的”（1974，P.232)。,"Turner writes that in nearly every society, a person in a liminal phase is ""structurally if not physically invisible in terms of his culture's standard definitions and classifications""(1974, p. 232)."
5440,最后的这些观察让人回忆起他无拘无束的狂飙突进（Storm and Drang)生涯.却似乎对狂欢节没有任何的指涉。,"Reminiscent of his unrestrained Sturm und Drang period, these last observations seem removed from any specific referent in the carnival."
5440,狂欢节只是歌德沉思的一个借口 。,The carnival is an excuse for Goethe's meditation.
5440,他关心的不是它对于参与者的意义，而是对于他自己和他的读者的意义。,"His concern is with ils meaning not for the participants, but for himself and his readers."
5440,歌德把狂欢节简化为一则关于个人命运的传统寓言，无视历史的和集体的维度，也无视巴赫金（Bakhtin 1965)所强调的、在充满了喜剧精神的大众命运与土地之间的联系。,"Ignoring the historical and the collective, the link, as Bakhtin (1965) stresses, between popular destiny, penetrated by the comic principle, and the earth, Goethe reduces the carnival to a conventional allegory of individual destiny."
5440,这节日的意义在于一个关于超越的故事——一个卡特林想为欧吉帕仪式寻找却从来没能真正找到的那种故事。,Its meaning lies in a transcendent story—the kind Catlin sought for the O-Kee-Pa ceremony but could never really find.
5440,歌德的寓言把个人从来回折腾、躁动和喑嚣——非个人化（unindividuated)—一的人群中拯救出来。,"Through Goethe's allegory, the individual is, so to speak, resurrected from the milling, seething, tumultuous—the unindividuated—crowd."
5441,代码也必须携带信息，这些信息是否含蓄，取决于它们所含信息的种类、对象和随后的加工过裎。,"Codes must also carry information, however implicitly, concerning what kind of information they contain, who it is for, and what is to be done with it."
5441,信息不仅仅涉及外部事件，而旦处于代码系统中的这些信息也会传递关于系统本身及其使用者的讯息。,"Besides information about external events, therefore, the messages in a codification system also convey information about the system itself and those who are using it."
5441,因此，讯息不仅交换信息，而且是交流的交流，或者说是“元信息传递” (Bateson 1951: 209)。,"Hence, not only do the messages communicate information, they are also communications about communication, or ""metacommunications"" (Bateson 1951:209)."
5442,倘若气候保持不变，看起来似乎有两种交互作用的因素极大地加速了生态环境的变化过程：人口增长和技术变化。,"Provided the climate remains constant, it seems as though two interrelated factors may dramatically speed up processes of change in the ecological environment: population growth and technological change."
5442,技术的变化倾向于指增加对自然资源的开采和对能量的使用。,Technological changes tend to imply an intensified exploitation of natural resources and an increased use of energy.
5442,人口增长往往是技术进步的后果，但也并不总是这样。,"Population growth is often, but not always, a result of technological change."
5442,一个可以养活大约1000个狩猎采集者或是2000个园艺种植者的区域，大约能够支持20000位使 用拖拉机和化肥的农民，但是他们将不能回复到园艺农业，而从这个角度上说，他们就失去了机动性（Bateson 1972）。,"An area which is capable of sustaining perhaps 1,000 hunters and gatherers, or 2,000 horticulturalists, may perhaps be able to support 20,000 farmers with tractors and chemical fertiliser, but they will not be able to revert to horticulture and have in this sense lost flexibility (Bateson 1972)."
5443,"借用弗洛伊德的术语，我们可以暂且将这场暴动所展现出 来的革命行为称作一个“原初心理过程""（primary process），这样，我们便将伊达尔戈领导的革命同其他地方所发生的相似的过程联系起来，因为这些“原初心理过程”就其本质而言是一致的。","If we can provisionally label the kind of revolutionary actions manifested in the insurrection, by analogy with Freud's usage, as a ""primary process"" as Dario Zadra has suggested, we have a clue to the nature of similar processes elsewhere."
5443,"原初心理过程并不源自习得性的和有意识的模式，它是所有的人经过长期的经验累积之后突然迸发出来的行为。这些人内心深处的物质需要和精神需要长期以来不能通过任何合法的方式来表达，他们被掌握权力的精英们所统治和约束，而这些精英们统治广大民众的方法类似于弗洛伊德心理分析体系中的“潜意识压抑作用""（censorship）。","A primary process does not develop from a cognitive, conscious model; it erupts from the cumulative experience of whole peoples whose deepest material and spiritual needs and wants have for long been denied any legitimate expression by power-holding elites who operate in a manner analogous to that of Freud's ""censorship"" in psychological systems."
5444,当早期原人的某些种群开始制造他们可用来屠宰动物以得到肉食的石制工具时，人类的文化看来就已经发展起来了。,Human culture appears to have developed as some populations of early hominines began making stone tools they could butcher animals with for their meat.
5444,最早的石制工具和值得注意的食肉证据，与人类出现一起，可追溯到约250方年前，人脑显著地扩大，超过任何其他早期原人的脑。,"Actually, the earliest stone tools and evidence of significant meat eating date to between 2.5 million and 2 million years ago, along with the appearance of the genus Homo, whose brain was significantly enlarged over that of any other early hominine."
5444,从那时起，习得的行为——文化——在人的持续生存中越来越重要，有助于更好的人脑的演化，反过来，更好的人脑使作为手段的文化改进成为可能，人类借助文化手段保证他们的持续生存。,"From then on the increasing importance of culture in human survival favored the evolution of a better brain, which in turn made possible improvement in culture as the vehicle humans used to secure their survival."
5444,在40万年前到20万年前之间，人脑的脑量达到现代人脑的大小，而文化则一直到现在还在不断地演化和变化。,"By about 200,000 years ago, the human brain had reached its modern size, but culture has continued to evolve and change down to the present."
5445,后面我会回到这个问题，但现在我想阐明我的立场。,"I shall come back to this question of perception later, but I want to make my own position clear."
5445,我会接受原生论不能很好地解释族裔差异这个观点，但是，当然要承认它对包含于族裔情感之中的非同一般的力量的一种描述。,"I would accept that primordialism does not work well as an explanation of ethnic difference, but it certainly works as a description of the extraordinary force that is contained in ethnic sentiment."
5445,对很多人来说，族裔纽带是忠诚、骄傲、定位、归属、避难、认同、信任、接纳和安全一类的事情。,"For many people, ethnic ties are a matter of loyalty, of pride, of location, of belonging, of refuge, of identity, trust, acceptance and security."
5446,我在本章开篇时指出，通过对环境的广泛文化比较，我们可能会逐渐了解环境决定论与其他认识世界的方式之间的异同性。,"At the beginning of this chapter I suggested that, by comparing a range of cultural perspectives on the environment, we might come to understand how environmentalism differs from, and is similar to, other ways of understanding the world."
5446,在开始进行比较分析时，我选择探讨环境决定论者和其他工业社会的人们普遍信仰的神话，即非工业社会拥有能与其 环境和睦相处的原始生态智慧。,"As a starting point for the comparative analysis, I chose to examine the myth, commonly held by environmentalists and others within industrial society, that nonindustrial societies possess a primitive ecological wisdom that enables them to live in harmony with their environments."
5446,以下我们通过比较的方法从文化的角度来分析神话以及环境决定论的特性。,"It is timeto consider what the comparison reveals, both about the myth and about the character of environmentalism as a cultural perspective."
5447,同一小群具有相同想法的学者一起，泰勒继续为此新学科设计出问题和概念，并在其具有影响力的《原始文化》（1871)中为其提供了一个连贯的表述。,"With a small handful of likeminded scholars, Tylor proceeded to work out the issues and concepts for the new discipline and gave them a coherent formulation in his influential Primitive Culture (1871)."
5447,他明确提出的理论前提——“人类心智同一性”极为重要：这一理念巧妙地运用其多义性将人种学者的废奴主义和人道主义信念转变为对全人类平等和其精神价值的承认。,"Of greatest importance was his explicit premise of ""the psychic unity of man"" — a felicitously polysemous transformation of the ethnologists' abolitionist and humanitarian commitment to the equality and moral value of all of humankind."
5447,这为人类学引入了一种相对主义，以调和维多利亚时代的民族中心主义。,It introduced into anthropology a relativism with which to temper Victorian ethnocentrism.
5448,这并不是说，人们一直没有注意到世界上与他们自己在看法和行为上不同的其他民族的存在。,This is not to say people always have been unaware of the existence of others in the world who look and act differently from themselves.
5448,例如，圣经《旧约全书》与《新约全书》充分提到各种各样的民族， 其中有犹太人、埃及人、赫梯人、巴比伦人、埃塞俄比亚人、罗马人等等。,"The Old and New Testaments of the Bible, for example, are full of references to diverse peoples, among them Jews, Egyptians, Hittites, Babylonians, Ethiopians, Romans, and so forth."
5448,这些民族之间的差异，比之他们中任何人与（例如）澳大利亚、亚马孙森林或北极的北美原住民的差异，就显得逊色了。,"The differences among these people pale by comparison to those between any of them and (for example) indigenous people of Australia, the Amazon forest, or arctic North America."
5448,借助于向真正遥远地方旅行的手段，人们有可能第一次遇到这类根本不同的民族。,"With the means to travel to truly faraway places, people found it possible to meet for the first time such radically different people."
5449,不过，人类学一般沿用林顿（Linton 1936）的定义，认为角色是身份的动态方面，也就是，人在身份定义限制下的实际行为。,"In anthropology, however, the role is generally defined – following Linton (1936) – as the dynamic aspect of the status, that is, a person's actual behaviour within the limitations set by the status definition."
5449,如，在现代社会中的一个典型身份可以是“巴士司机”；巴士司机的角色将由这个作为巴士司机的人的所作所为来定义。你的特定的社会身份直接决定着你应该以怎样的特定方式行动。,"A typical status in a modern society may be ""bus driver""; the role of the bus driver will then be defined by what one actually does as a bus driver.Being the incumbent of a particular social status directs one's actions in specified ways."
5449,例如，公主被认为是不能在深夜的下流娱乐场所喝啤酒的；因纽特人的巫师被认为在必要的时候应该与超自然力建立联系；特罗布里恩德群岛的妻子被认为在性的方面应该是一夫一妻制的；德国工厂的工人被认为每个工作日的早晨8点以前就应该来报到。,"A princess, for instance, is expected not to drink beer late at night at seedy joints.A shaman among the Inuit is expected to establish contact with supernatural powers when necessary; a wife in the Trobriand Islands is expected to be sexually monogamous; a worker in a German factory is expected to register for work before 8 a.m.every weekday."
5449,如果有谁破坏了其身份所设定的角色的规则和期望，社会的其他成员会通过施加制裁或其他不同的惩罚形式作为反应。,"When one breaks the rules and expectations connected with the role enactment of a status, other members of society may react by imposing sanctions or different forms of punishment."
5450,所以，社会同时定义了越轨和正常。,Society therefore defined both deviance and normality.
5450,但是规训的统治不仅仅是从外部得到强化的——它们还常常为那些被迫承受它们的人所内化，这些人于是开始规训自身。,"But regimes of discipline were not just enforced from the outside—they were also frequently internalized by those made subject to them, who therefore came to discipline themselves."
5450,这种状况在现代世界当中被更连贯的和更广泛的监督所加强，其例证之一即为最近城市中心的安全摄像头的大量涌现，这简直堪称圆形监狱监控模式的现代运用。,"This situation was enforced in the modern world by the greater continuity and comprehensiveness of surveillance, now exemplified by the recent explosion in city-center security cameras as a modern form of panopticon."
5450,这些规训措施都是由福柯称之为知识的结构或编码的东西，无论是宗教的、法律的或者科学的，来指导实施的。,"These disciplinary operations were conducted through what Foucault called structures, or codes of knowledge, whether religious, legal, or scientific, which were created by self-appointed experts in such a way as to appear both natural and neutral."
5451,阈限的概念来自拉丁文“极限（limen）”（英文threshold），意指所有间隙性的或模棱两可的状态，这个概念与维克多·特纳的作品，以及他所拓展的阿诺德·范·盖纳普的原创观点是分不开的。马科斯·格拉克曼、玛丽·道格拉斯和埃德蒙·利奇都从这个概念中获益匪浅，并产生大量的附属应用。,"The concept of liminality, from the Latin word for ‘threshold’ (limen) and implying all manner of interstitiality, of being betwixt and between, is most associated with the work of Victor Turner, and his extending of the original ideas of Arnold van Gennep; it has also been put to profitable use by Max Gluckman, Mary Douglas and Edmund Leach, and given rise to a host of spin-off applications."
5451,通过阈限，人类学才有可能在概念上关注边缘、改变、反抗、排斥、附属、污染、反常和越轨等现象。,"Through liminality, anthropology has found it possible to focus conceptually upon such phenomena as marginality, alterity, rebellion, ostracism, subalternality, pollution, eccentricity and deviance."
5452,长老会几乎每天都要聚会讨论村子的各种由土地争论、遗产情况、和邻村之间发生的纠纷或罪行等引起的问题，以及计划即将到来的宗教庆典。,"The council of elders meets almost daily to discuss village problems ranging from land disputes, inheritance cases, to crimes or conflicts with neighbouring villages, as well as planning upcoming religious festivities."
5452,传统上，村委会和贺贡是对超出个体家户的问题施加政治权力。,The village council and the hogon traditionally have exerted political authority over problems above the level of the individual household.
5452,（今天，国家制度已逐渐接管了他们的许多传统任务。,(Today state institutions are gradually taking over many of their traditional tasks.)
5452,）他们有权接受村民的礼物，也有义务给遭受了不同程度的伤害的村民以补偿。,"They are entitled to receive presents from the inhabitants, but are also committed to paying compensation to inhabitants who have suffered various damages."
5452,贺贡拥有很多权力，和现代社会的政府一样。,The hogon has many of the same kinds of power as the state in modern societies.
5452,当人们违反法律时，由贺贡来定罪量刑，他是“总理”和“大主教”，并负责再分配。,"He measures out punishment when the law is broken, he is ""prime minister"" and ""archbishop"" and he is responsible for redistribution."
5452,他从社区成员那里收受的礼物可以看成是税收，他有义务为了公共利益对此进行再分配。,"The presents he receives from the members of the community can be seen as taxes, and he is obliged to redistribute them for the common good."
5453,当涉及“事件”(events)，即历史中无法预知的变化的问题时，他提出了“局势结构”(the structure of the conjuncture)的概念。在这一概念中，事件按照文化排序整理，并且在这一过程中文化自身也得到重新整理。,"To deal with the problem of ""events,"" the unpredictable twists of history, he proposed the notion of ""the structure of the conjuncture,"" whereby events are ordered by culture and, in the process, culture itself is reordered."
5453,（他对此的表述是：“一种结构的再生产”可能会“成为它的转变。,"(As he phrased it, ""the reproduction of a structure"" may ""become its transformation."")"
5453,"”）在一系列对1778年库克船长与夏威夷人的相遇以及接下来发生的事件进行重新解释的作品中(Sahlins 1981,1985),他极为详尽地发展了这些观点。","He developed these ideas in great detail in a series of works reinterpreting the encounter of Captain Cook with the Hawaiians in 1778 and the events that followed (1981, 1985)."
5454,社会戏剧以及社会事业——以及其他类型的过程化单位——代表了社会事件的前后连贯性，如果一个观察者将这些事件加以回溯，便能发现它们的结构。,"Social dramas and social enterprises—as well as other kinds of processual units—represent sequences of social events, which, seen retrospectively by an observer, can be shown to have structure."
5454,这种“时间性”的结构不同于非时间性结构（包括“概念的”、“认知的”以及“句法的”结构），尽管认知过程本身是一种智力过程并具有程序性的特点，但时间性结构基本上按照时间的关系而非空间的关系来组织。,"Such ""temporal"" structure, unlike atemporal structure (including ""conceptual,"" ""cognitive,"" and ""syntactical"" structures), is organized primarily through relations in time rather than in space, though, of course, cognitive schemes are themselves the result of a mental process and have processual qualities."
5454,如果有人能像看动作片一样注意到社会过程并且能够仔细审视“静止”的部分——即一个社区中与社会过程并存的社会关系，那么他可能就会发现这些暂时性的结构既不完整也并非完美无缺，而是需要不断地进行调整。,"If one were able to arrest the social process as though it were a motion film and were then to examine the ""still,"" the coexisting social relations within a community, one would probably find that the temporary structures were incomplete, open-ended, unconsummated."
5455,没有专职工作高度分化的社会比那些有这种高度分化的社会存在的时间要长得多，而在前一种社会中，总是有一些个人拥有特殊的能力和技巧，使他们可以接触并操纵超自然存在和力量。他们通常独自通过个人体验而获得此类力量和技巧。,"Societies that lack full-time occupational specialization have existed far longer than those with such specialization, and the former always have had individuals who acquired religious power individually, usually in solitude and isolation, when the Great Spirit, the Power, the Great Mystery, or whatever is revealed to them."
5455,在一种异常的意识状态之下，他们得到某种幻象，这种幻象陚予他们力量去医治疾病、改变天气、控制动物的活动以及预言未来。当这些个人出色地做到这些以及其他相关技巧时，他们就扮演了萨满（Shamans）的角色。,"These persons become the recipients of certain special gifts, such as healing or divination; when they return to society, they frequently are given another kind of religious role, that of the shaman."
5455,在美国，上百万的人是通过布莱克·埃尔克的自传和卡洛斯·卡斯塔涅达的叙述对萨满有所了解的。前者叙述的是传统的印第安部落拉科塔人的圣人，而后者叙述的则是关于他与印第安部落雅基人的萨满唐璜之间大部分虚构的故事。,"In the United States millions of people have learned something about shamans through reading the popular autobiography of Black Elk, a traditional Oglala Sioux Indian ""medicine man，"" or Carlos Castaneda's apparently fictional accounts of his experiences with Don Juan, the Yaqui Indian shaman."
5456,在所有人类社会中，尽管女性可能是照顾孩子的首要人选，但她们同样得承担其他责任。,"In all human societies, even though women may be the primary providers of child care, women have other responsibilities as well."
5456,虽然在她们所从事的传统经济活动中，有几项是与她们抚养孩子的角色兼容的，因而不会使她们的后代面临危险，但这并非说她们从事的所有活动都这样。,"Although several of the economic activities they traditionally have engaged in have been compatible with their child-rearing role and have not placed their off-spring at risk, this cannot be said of all their activities."
5456,"想想最普通的抚养孩子和烹饪食物这两项工作加在一起，是如何造成一种对孩子具有潜在危险的环境的,尤其是当食物是在野外烹制的时候如果母亲（或者其他的抚养者)被其他任务分心，那么小孩就很可能被严重地烧伤或割伤。","Consider how the common combination of child care with food preparation, especially if cooking is done over an open fire, creates a potentially hazardous situation for children.With the mother (or other caregiver) distracted by some other task, the child all too easily may receive a severe burn or bad cut, with serious consequences."
5457,对诺德和其他许多艺术家来说，将非欧洲人的艺术风格合并到他们自己的作品中，提供了一种获得真实性的方法，他们感觉在自己那个时代的生活方式中这种真实性已经丢失了（Lloyd 1991: 96ff.）。,"For Norde and many other artists the incorporating of the art styles of non-European peoples into their own work provided the means through which they could achieve an authenticity that had been lost, they felt, in the art and lifestyle of their own times (see Lloyd 1991:96 ff.)."
5457,通过捕捉原始手工制品的原初的生命力和儿童、民间和土著艺术的自发性和直觉力，他们希望能够直抵“本质”。,"The desire was to penetrate into the ‘essential’ by capturing the primal vitality of primitive hand-made production and the spontaneity and intuitive force of child, folk and native arts."
5457,类似部落、民间和儿童的创造被认为是真实的，也尚未被工业革命所离间（unalienated）（see Lloyd 1991）和玷污。,"Tribal, folk and child creations alike were considered to be objects that were authentic, and also unalienated (see Lloyd 1991), unsullied by the Industrial Revolution."
5458,为比较和分析起见，人类学家习惯上把文化分解成许多看起来分离的各个部分，虽然这种区分是武断的。,"For comparison and analysis, anthropologists customarily break a culture down into many seemingly discrete parts, even though such distinctions are arbitrary."
5458,"因为文化是系统，所以，始终如一地考察文化某一方面的人类学家,发现也有必要考察文化的其他方面。",The anthropologist who examines one aspect of a culture invariably finds it necessary to examine others as well.
5458,就如在任何系统中，为了发挥作用，文化的各个方面必定合理地整合在一起。,This tendency for all aspects of a culture to function as an interrelated whole is called integration.
5458,北美人类学家利奧波德˙波西皮西尔1955年对新几内亚西部的山民巴布亚卡保库人的研究，可以说明文化在经济、政治和社会方面的整合。,"The integration of the economic, political, and social aspects of a culture can be illustrated by the Kapauku Papuans, a mountain people of western New Guinea studied in 1955 by North American anthropologist Leopold Pospisil."
5459,现代化的另外两个特征与上文已经提到的那些方面同时出现。,Two other features of modernization go hand in hand with those already noted.
5459,第一，结构分化（structural differentiation），即承担两项或多项功能的单一传统角色，分化成两个或多个只具备一项特定专门功能的角色。,"One, structural differentiation, is the division of single traditional roles, which embrace two or more functions, into two or more separate roles, each with a single specialized function."
5459,这意味着社会的某种分裂，如果不希望社会分裂成若千分散的单元，就必须用新的整合机制（integrative mechanism）来抵消这种分裂。,"This represents a kind of fragmentation of society, which must be counteracted by new integrative mechanisms if the society is not to disintegrate into a number of discrete units."
5459,这些新的整合机制的形式有：正式的政府结构、官方意识形态、政党、法典、工会和其他的共同利益团体。,"These new mechanisms take such forms as formal governmental structures, official state ideologies, political parties, legal codes, and labor and trade unions as well as other common-interest associations."
5460,要成为所研究文化的参与观察者并不意味着，为研究战争频繁的文化，民族志学家要加入人们的战斗；但是由于生活在好战的人群中，民族志学家应当能够理解战争是如何与整个文化结构相契合的。,"Participant observation of the culture under study does not mean the ethnographer must join in a peopled battles in order to study a culture where warfare is prominent; but by living among a warlike people, the ethnographer should be able to understand the role of warfare in the overall cultural scheme."
5460,他或她必须是谨慎的观察者，以便能够达到对一种文化的深入概观，而没有不适当地强调文化的某一方面而忽略了另一方面。,He or she must be a meticulous observer to get a broad overview of a culture without placing undue emphasis on one of its parts at the expense of another.
5460,只有通过发现所有的文化制度——社会的、政治的、经济的、宗教的制度——是怎样相互联系的，民族志学家才可能开始理解文化体系。,"Only by discovering how all cultural institutions—social, political, economic, religious— relate to one another can ethnographers begin to understand cultural systems."
5460,人类学家把这—研究方式称为整体论视角（holistic perspective），而且它是人类学的基本原则之一。,"Anthropologists re¬fer to this as the holistic perspective, and it is one of the fundamental principles of anthropology."
5461,尽管与北美文化的消极态度正相反。但是，进入类似出神状态和体验（一种范围广泛的幻觉）的能力，本身没有什么是反常的。,"The negative attitude of North American culture notwithstanding, nothing is abnormal perse about the ability to enter trancelike states and experience a wide range of hallucinations."
5461,相反，周期性改变意识的欲望是一种天生的、正常的冲动，类似于饥饿和性欲的冲动甚至有很好的证据表明，黑猩猩、狒狒、其他猴子、猫、狗和其他动物也产生幻觉，而且这种能力是哺乳动物不只是人类神经系统的功能。,"To the contrary, The desire to alter consciousness periodically is an innate, normal drive analogous to culture, the concept of normal personality is quite not just human, nervous system."
5461,因此，进入变异状态和体验幻觉及其他感觉的能力似乎在智人出现前就有了，毫不令人惊讶，进入出神状态的能力是人类共同的能力。,"Thus, the ability to enter altered states and experience visions and other sensations appears to predate the appearance of Homo sapiens, and it is not surprising that the ability to enter trance is a human universal."
5462,为什么要告诉全世界？,Why tell it to the world?
5462,卡特林没有为他的经验提供框架——没有证明他的报道是正当的。,Catlin has no framework for his experience—no justification for his reportage.
5462,他的目的是忠实地记录，但是这个目的足以让目击和描述一个“让一位乡间旅行者的心甚至胃都生出厌恶”(第182—183页），同时却使这样一位旅行者充满同情的“惊人而恶心的习俗”变得正当吗？,"His intention is documentary, but does this intention justify witnessing and describing a ""shocking and disgusting custom"" that ""sickens the heart and even the stomach of a traveller in the country"" (182 — 83) and yet that fills such a traveler with pity?"
5462,卡特林用一种含混的方式使他的描述理性化了。,Catlin rationalizes his description in a confused manner.
5462,（他从来就不是一个有系统的思想者。,(He was never a systematic thinker.)
5462,）他在文中说这仪式“对文明世界来讲会相当新奇，因此值得了解”(第157页）。,"He writes that the ceremony ""will be new to the civilized world, and therefore worth knowing"" (157)."
5462,他暗示着此仪式的某些部分很奇特、很有意思，而与洪水相关的其他部分则“无害且充满了趣味”(第177页）。,"He suggests that parts of the ceremony are grotesque and amusing and others, having to do with the deluge, are ""harmless and full of interest"" (177)."
5463,这一复杂的跨学科领域的发展始自人类学的危机，如今仍是变化的、多样的。,"This complex interdisciplinary area, approached here from the starting point of a crisis in anthropology, is changing and diverse."
5463,因此我不想给本书的探索性文章强加一种虚假的一致性。,Thus I do not want to impose a false unity on the exploratory essays that follow.
5463,虽然作者们都于一种混合了诗学、政治学和史学的方法心有威威，他们也常常有不一致的时候。,"Though sharing a general sympathy for approaches combining poetics, politics, and history, they frequently disagree.Many of the contributions fuse literary theory and ethnography."
5463,一些人査考上述态度的局限，强调制度化权力的限制和唯美主义的危险；其他人热情倡导试验性写作形式。,"Some probe the limits of such approaches, stressing the dangers of estheticism and the constraints of institutional power.Others enthusiastically advocate experimental forms of writing."
5463,但他们都出于对未来的可能性的承诺，以不同的方式共同分析了过去和现在的实践。,But in their different ways they all analyze past and present practices out of a commitment to future possibilities.
5463,他们视民族志写作为变动不居的、创造性的：以威廉˙卡洛斯˙威廉斯（William Carlos Williams）的话说，“历史对于我们，应该像小提琴家的左手一样”。,"They see ethnographic writing as changing, inventive: ""History,"" in William Carlos Williams's words, ""that should be a left hand to us, as of a violinist."""
5464,与形式论一实质论的争论相似的是在政治体系和法律方面展开的讨论。,A parallel to the formalist/substantivist debate was played out in discussions of political systems and law.
5464,一方声称法律和政治的普遍原理能够适用于所有社会，例如因纽特人（Inuit）的社会制裁模式可以被视为初始的法律。,"On one side were those who claimed that there were universal principles of law and politics that could be applied to all societies; modes of social sanction among the Inuit, for example, could be treated as incipient law."
5464,另一方是像弗里德（Fried 1967)这样的政治实体论者，他们强调这些社会与那些制裁受到制度化力量支撑的社会存在着性质上的差异。考虑到他们对国家的定义，即一个以垄断暴力为基础的实体，那么对他们而言，国家社会和非国家社会是无法比较的。,"On the other side were the political substantivists, such as Fried (1967), who insisted that there was a qualitative difference between such societies and those in which sanctions were backed by institutionalized force; for them, state and nonstate societies were incommensurate, given their definition of the state as an entity based upon a monopoly on force."
5464,这样的一些观点得到了详细的说明和连篇累牍的论证。,These positions were elaborated on and argued at length.
5465,事实上，要把这些问题和其他与之抵触的要求进行调和并不容易。每一个政治团体都必须找到自己的平衡点。,"There is no easy way to reconcile these and other conflicting requirements, and each political community has to strike its own balance."
5465,然而，有几个一般性的考量可以指导它的选择。,"There are, however, several general considerations that could guide its choice."
5465,虽然，一个政治团体不能否定和拒绝它从历史上继承来的认同，但是，它可以正式宣称自己属于多元文化，像加拿大、澳大利亚和其他国家所做的那样。,"Although a political community cannot deny or reject its historically inherited identity, it can officially declare itself multicultural, as Canada, Australia and other countries have done."
5466,当民族志学家参与不熟悉的文化时，不是盲目地瞎闯，而是谋取个别知情人（informant)的帮助。,"When participating in unfamiliar cultures, ethnographers do not just blunder about blindly but enlist the assistance of individual informants."
5466,这些人是作为民族志学家的人类学家在其中工作的那个社会的成员，他或她与他们形成了密切关系，他们帮助人类学家成为社区的新来者，弄清正在发生的任何活动。,"These are members of the society the anthropologist as ethnographer is working in, who she or he develops close relationships with and who help interpret whatever activities are occurring."
5466,就如儿童从其父母那里学会正确行为那样，知情人有助于人类学家在田野中理解先前陌生文化中的“奥秘”。,"As a child learns proper behavior from its parents, so do informants help the anthropologist in the field unravel the ""mysteries"" of what is，at first, a strange culture."
5466,民族志的田野工作对民族学来说是如此基本的工作，以致英国人类学家C.G.塞利格曼曾断言:“人类学的田野研究就如殉道者的血之于教会。”,"So basic is ethnographic fieldwork to ethnology that the British anthropologist C. G. Seligman once asserted, ""Field research in anthropology is what the blood of the martyrs is to the church."""
5467,与上述所有这些（和其他）关于从“文化”或“社会”的角度如何感知世界的视角不同，那些强调行为者观点的人类学家辩称道，没有两个个体是以一种同样的方式看世界的，因此将整个社会进行归纳是荒谬的。,"Against all of these (and other) perspectives regarding how ""cultures"" or ""societies"" perceive the world, anthropologists stressing the actor's point of view have argued that no two individuals see the world in the same way and that it is therefore preposterous to generalise about entire societies."
5467,在此，女性主义的冲击是决定性的。,The impact of feminism has been decisive here.
5467,1970年代以来，女性主义人类学家区分了常常具有很大差异的男人和女人的世界观，他们展示了“社会”的传统解释实际上指的只是男人的视角，因为不管是人类学家还是主要资料提供者都好像是男人（Ardener 1977）。,"Since the 1970s, feminist anthropologists have identified often profound differences between male and female world-views, showing how classic accounts of ""societies"" really refer to male perspectives on them as both the anthropologist and the main informants tended to be male (Ardener 1977)."
5467,从另一条脉络来说，早先从个体方法论的角度批判过结构-功能主义的巴思分析了新几内亚和巴厘岛的知识体系（Barth 1975，1993，参见第六章），揭示了哪怕是很小的社会其内部所具有的种种巨大变化。,"In a different vein, Fredrik Barth, who had earlier criticised structural-functionalism from a methodological individualist perspective, presented analyses of knowledge systems in New Guinea and Bali (Barth 1975, 1993, see Chapter 6) revealing great variations within societies, even very small ones."
5468,对于道格拉斯而言（正如杜尔凯姆一样），意义之源就是社会本身。,"For Douglas (as for Durkheim), the source of meaning is society itself."
5468,文化视角的内容不是由“现实”世界中的物质决定的，而是由需要人们维持的社会组织形式决定的。,"The content of cultural perspectives is determined, not by what exists in the ""real"" world, but by the form of social organization they are required to sustain."
5468,比如，人们对于什么是脏的、什么是可以食用或不可以食用的（Douglas 1966)或动物的分类（Douglas 1957)等方面的知识都源自于社会结构。,"People's knowledge of what constitutes dirt, for instance, or of what is or is not edible (Douglas 1966), or of animal categories (Douglas 1957), is generated by their social structure."
5468,在道格拉斯的理论体系中，人们对于周围事物的认识并不源自于他们的社会条件（参见Richards 1?93)，社会是知识产生的惟一源泉，除此之外再没有别的可以直接感知的对象。,"There is no room here for knowledge to arise from any source other than society, for people to discover things about the world that are not derived from their social conditioning (cf. Richards 1993); no room for direct perception."
5469,基本结构包括直接交换的各种体系，也就是说，一个集团与另一个集团互换妻子。,"Elementary structures include systems of direct exchange, where a group may ‘take’ wives from the same group it ‘gives’ wives to."
5469,最简单的一种形式就是一个男人与其母亲的兄弟的女儿 (MBD)  或父亲的姊妹的女儿 (FZD) 结婚，就像在南美和澳大利亚的一些地方那样。,"The simplest type is one involving marriage between a man and his mother’s brother’s daughter (MBD) or father’s sister’s daughter (FZD), as in some parts of South America and Australia."
5469,基本结构还包括延迟直接交换制度。,Elementary structures also include systems of delayed direct exchange.
5470,米勒和冯·奥彭的分析表明，建立有界限的族性需要做的事情是彻底瓦解覆盖面广且不稳定的殖民前期贸易网络，交流和仪式参与。,"The analyses of Miller and von Oppen show that one thing that was needed to set the scene for territorially-bounded ethnicity was the disruption of the fluid and wide-ranging pre-colonial networks of trade, exchange, ritual participation etc."
5470,殖民主义就需要这种瓦解分裂。,
5470,,And colonialism involved just such a disruption.
5470,非洲人的贸易和市场被逐渐剥夺；地域和部落边界被建立起来，成为村落和人们移动的障碍。,Trade and marketing was increasingly taken out of African hands; territorial and ‘tribal’ frontiers were established as barriers to the movement of villages and people.
5471,对大多数人而言，后现代和后殖民主义依旧是振奋人心的。,For many of us the breezes of post-modernism and post-colonialism have been refreshing.
5471,即便如此，依然不能简单地去谴责人类学曾作为殖民控制与统治的帮凶，也不可对具有明显现代主义倾向的学术模式的大部分成就，进行简单的定性（Ardener 1985）。,"Be that as it may, there is no simple answer to the accusations that anthropology has served as handmaiden to colonial conquest and government, and for the most part was developed within intellectual frameworks distinctly modernist in design (see Ardener 1985)."
5471,尽管大多数曾在殖民地开展研究的人类学家已通过修正错误减少其作品中殖民主义的色彩，人类学至少在某种程度上依旧自视为社会科学而不是艺术，它不过是无意中契合过殖民主义的目标。,"Although most anthropologists working among the colonized have viewed their programme as one to alleviate the weight of colonialism by reducing its mistakes, anthropology—at least to the extent it has considered itself a social science and not of the arts—has nevertheless inadvertently served colonialism’s aim."
5472,对古德曼的各种创造性的制造世界的方式提出补充的，是普里斯顿 (Preston)的尝试（然而好像自相矛盾），他描述了想象的创造能力。,"Complementary to Goodman's account of the various processes of creative world-making is Preston's attempt (however seemingly oxymoronic), then, to describe the inventive qualities of the imagination (1991)."
5472,普里斯顿认为想象一般沿着四个维度改变世界：空间的、时间的、形态学的和理解的。,"The imagination commonly transforms the world along four dimensions, Preston suggests: the spatial, the temporal, the morphological and the comprehensive."
5472,在每个维度里都存在各种可能的改造过程，可能单独发生，也可能一起发生。,"Within each of these dimensions, there then exists a variety of possible processes of transformation, which can occur singly or together."
5472,例如，在空间维度，现存世界可以用“扩大”、“缩小”、“浓缩”（就像缩写一样）或“移动”（从观察者看来）等方式来想象。,"For example, ""spatially"" an existing world might be imaginatively transformed through ""magnification"" and ""miniaturization"", through ""condensation"" (as in a shorthand), or through ""translocation"" (of the viewing eye)."
5473,例如，在“巫毒教（voodoo)死亡”中，如果群体宣称一个人死了，他就死了。,"In ""voodoo death"", for example, if the group declares a person dead, he dies."
5473,相反，在治愈仪式中，如果群体宣称一个人好了，他就好了。,"Conversely, in rituals of healing, if the group declares a person well, he gets well."
5473,在这里，个体意识是如此深陷于群体意识中，以至于谈论像我们所知道的个体主义是不准确的。,Here individual consciousness is so deeply enmeshed with group consciousness that it is not accurate to speak of individualism as we know it.
5473,（夸大这样社会里的集体主义特征也是不准确的，因为他们同样有其个体主义的一面；只不过是在与我们自己的生活进行更宽广的比较中，这一点被掩盖了。）,"(It is also inaccurate to exaggerate the collectivist character of such societies, for they have their individualistic aspects too; yet, in broad comparison with our own lives, the point holds.)"
5474,他也多少注意到了体现在教职工和其他学生中的中产阶级文化，并认识到女孩、西印度群岛裔人和亚洲裔人之间视角的不同，但他主要还是把自己限定在写作一部选点于学校的、关于他的12个叛逆男孩的民族志。,"He pays some attention to middle class culture, as manifested in staff and other students, and he recognizes distinct perspectives for girls, West Indians, and Asians, but mainly he keeps to a school-situated ethnography of his twelve nonconformist boys."
5474,在各个标题下，这部民族志逐字逐句地记录了这些年轻人之间的讨论，在场的作者也是参加谈话者之一，威利斯对谈话的直接阐释与从男孩们与他的群体讨论中剪切下来的对话片段交替出现。,"This ethnography, arranged by topical headings, is presented as verbatim discussions among the lads, with the author present as interlocutor.Straightforward commentary elaborating on the discourse alternates with cuttings of dialogue from group discussions with Willis."
5474,书中不时有对学校这一地点的氛围的描述，但威利斯要是釆用对话记录作为其民族志证据的主要形式。,"There are occasional descriptions of the atmosphere of the school as a place, but the reporting of dialogue is the main form of ethnographic evidence employed by Willis."
5475,另外， 民族学家们依然在收集现存文化的资料，但人们知道，历经多个世纪文化会有变化。,"Moreover, ethnologists were collecting data on living cultures, but cultures known to have changed through the centuries."
5475,威斯勒的假说认为，在任何文化区域，文化特质都趋向于从中心向外围扩展。,Wissler’s hypothesis was that culture traits tended to spread from the centre to the periphery of any culture area.
5475,所以，那些在外围发现的文化特质较为古老，而在中心地区发现的那些文化特质则是较新的。,"Therefore those traits found at the periphery were older, and those found at the centre were newer."
5476,对殖民官员的嘲弄性的批评和描绘似乎与广为接受的那种认为被殖民者是缺乏领悟力的受害者的观念不相符。,"The mocking critiques and images of colonial masters would make, it seems, a bad fit with the widely accepted view that the colonized are uncomprehending victims."
5476,今天，这种关于无家可归者的艺术已经经常和伦敦或巴黎训练出来的关于“回家”的世故的意象联姻，力图清晰地展现中心与边缘之间辩证的文化论题及其与权力的关系。,"Nowadays, this art of the unhomely, which often weds a ‘sophisticated’ Western training in Paris or London with imagery from ‘back home’, tends to make explicit the dialectics of cultural discourses between centre and periphery, and their related relations of power."
5476,有很多有影响的艺术家从边缘国家来到广大的艺术市场，但仍旧不为西方所知，被忽视甚至被强制地方化（Brett 1991）。,"There have been, however, many powerful artists from countries peripheral to the great art markets who on the whole are unknown to the West, ignored by it and thereby forcibly localized (Brett 1991)."
5477,在城里，人们根据他们的出身（一种只在更早期才具有很少相关性的标准）相互归类，并且许多新的在城里成为可能的联系形式——同龄人群体、俱乐部，等等——是建立在民族成员身份的基础上的。,"In towns, people categorised each other according to their place of origin (a criterion which had only rarely been relevant earlier), and many of the new forms of association made possible by the town – peer groups, clubs, etc.– were based on ethnic membership."
5477,意义重大的是，米切尔注意到，都市化之后，“部落”和群体成员的概念仍然是重要的，但是为了适应整个社会组织的转变，它的重要性发生了变化。,"Mitchell notes, significantly, that the notion of ""tribe"" and group membership continues to be important after urbanisation, but that its significance changes in response to shifts in the overall social organisation."
5477,这样，他——和团体中的其他成员——预示了后来种族符号论研究的发展（参见第十七章）。,"In this way, he – and other members of the group – foreshadows later developments in the study of ethnic symbolism (see Chapter 17)."
5477,但是，这部著作的主体却被批评对社会变化所持观点过于肤浅，因为它将乡村生活到城市生活的转变看成是一种过于线性的过程（Ferguson 1990）。,"This body of work has nonetheless been criticised for taking too facile a view of social change, seeing the transition from village life to city life as an overly linear process (Ferguson 1990)."
5478,传统和传统主义之间的不同可能有助于我们理解这种差别。现代语境下的传统文化的“再度觉醒”，对于要继续生存下去的土著民族来说似乎是必要的，它通常从一种更广义的种族复兴的角度被提起。,"The distinction between tradition and traditionalism may help us to understand the difference.That ""reawakening"" of traditional culture in a modern context, which seems necessary for indigenous peoples to survive, is often spoken of in more general terms as ethnic revitalisation."
5478,前面描述过的对挪威历史的发现或发明是一个经典的例子，复兴的概念从字面上看意思是隐匿了一段时期的文化的符号和实践重新获得它们失去的意义。,"The discovery, or invention, of the Norwegian past described earlier is a classic example.The concept of revitalisation literally means that cultural symbols and practices which have lain dormant for a while regain their lost relevance."
5478,但是，我们应该意识到，一种复兴的文化总是与原先的那种文化有很大差异，复兴运动是传统主义者要在一个并非传统而是现代的语境中为传统寻求意义的运动。,"However, we have to be aware that a revitalised culture is always very different from the original.Revitalisation movements are traditionalist in that they seek to make tradition relevant in a context which is not itself traditional, but modern."
5479,我列举一个极端的例子。,"I shall give just one, admittedly extreme, example."
5479,1989年南非种族隔离解除以前，黑人、白人、有色人和亚洲人是彼此分离的。同时 黑人又被再分成不同的族体：祖鲁人（Zulu）、茨瓦纳人（Tswa-na）、科萨人（Xhosa）等等。,"Until the end of legal apartheid in South Africa in 1989, blacks, whites, coloureds and Asians were legally separated from one another, while the black section of the population was subdivided into ethnicities – Zulu, Tswana, Xhosa etc."
5479,我们从中均可识别出这一系列限制的人为因素。,"While we can all recognise the artificiality of a number of these distinctions,"
5480,此外，他还是一个活跃于公共问题如民族主义、种族关系、教育和优生学的评论家。他所参与的这些活动并非出自某种特别的政治目的，而是基于人类学知识应能为解决社会问题指明道路的信念。,"He was, moreover, a frequent commentator on public issues such as nationalism, race relations, education, and eugenics, not as part of a specifically political program but in the conviction that anthropological knowledge would itself point the way to societal solutions."
5480,尽管博厄斯的学生经常自称为该学派的成员，但是他们之间仍然存在着巨大的差别。,"Although Boas's students are often spoken of as Boasians, there were strong differences among them."
5480,（同时有必要指出的是：博厄斯本人习惯于自我批评，他经常会改变看法并且否定其以前的观点。）,"(It must also be said that Boas himself was selfcritical, often changing his views and retracting earlier opinions.)"
5481,幻想型精神分裂症的一个准确的形象是以温迪戈闻名的所谓种族精神病（ethnic psychoses）。,A precise image of paranoid schizophrenia is one of the so-called ethnic psychoses known as Windigo.
5481,这种精神病与特定族群特有的精神错乱症状（参见表5.1)直接相关。,Such psychoses involve symptoms of mental disorder specific to particular ethnic groups (Table 5.1).
5481,食人狂精神病限于诸如克里人和奥吉布瓦人那种北部阿尔衰琴印第安人群体内。,"Windigo psychosis is limited to northern Aigonkian Indian groups such as the Chippewa, Cree, and Ojibwa."
5481,在这些北部印第安人的传统信念体系中，他们承认被称为温迪戈的食人妖怪的存在。,"In their traditional belief systems, these northern Indians recognized the existence of cannibalistic monsters called Windigos."
5481,患这种精神病的人形成一种幻想，他们陷入这些妖怪的控制之下，他们自身正在变成温迪戈，渴望吃到人肉。,"Individuals afflicted by the psychosis developed the delusion that, falling under control of these monsters, they themselves were being transformed into Windigos, with a craving for human flesh."
5481,在这种情况发生的同时，他们看到他们周围的人正变成各种各样的可吃的动物——例如，多脂多汁的河狸。,"Meanwhile, they saw people around them turning into various edible animals—fat, juicy beavers, for instance."
5482,刚才所引述的巴西印第安人的例子，提出了种族灭绝（germcide）的问题——一个族群把另一个族群的人彻底消灭，这常常是蓄意的，而且常常是在“进步”的名 义之下进行的。,"The Brazilian Indian case just cited raises the issue of genocide—the extermination of one group of people by another, often deliberately and in the name of ""progress""."
5482,"种族灭绝在这个世界上并不是什么新事物,我们只需要看看北美历史就可以见到了。","Genocide is not new in the world, as we need look no farther than North American history to see."
5482,例如，1637年就发生过一次蓄意灭绝佩科特印第安人的事，那些人纵火焚烧了佩科特印第安人在康涅狄格州米斯蒂克的村庄，并用枪打死所有那些企图逃跑以免被火烧死的人——首先是妇女和儿童。,"In 1637, for example, a deliberate attempt was made to destroy the Pequot Indians by setting afire their village at Mystic, Connecticut, and then shooting down all those— primarily women and children—who sought to es­cape from being burned alive."
5482,为了连他们的记忆都被扑灭，殖民当局甚至还禁止提到佩科特人的名字。,
5483,种族偏见与种族冲突时常被认作和解释为主要是一种心理现象。,The phenomenon of race prejudice and inter-racial antagonisms is frequently regarded and explained as primarily a psychological phenomenon.
5483,由于种族问题是在个人有机体的行为和态度中显现出来的，因此，人们时常想当然地认为，从科学解释的立场出发，种族偏见和种族冲突问题属心理学领域；而从治理这些问题的观点来看，它们则又属于精神病学范畴。,"Since the phenomenon is manifested in acts and attitudes of individual human organisms it is frequently taken for granted that the problem of race prejudice and inter-racial antagonisms is psychological from the standpoint of scientific explanation, and psychiatric from the point of view of therapy."
5483,精神分析学提出如下的一些解释：犹太人是制订法典和形成超我的家长，也是不知悔悟的叛逆者。,
5483,,"Psychoanalysis has come forward with interpretations such as these: The Jew is identified with the law-giving, super-ego forming father, and also wdth the unrepentant parricide."
5484,事实上，一旦强权被侵蚀，对臣民的法律安排就不可能继续了。,But legislated arrangements for subject peoples are not likely to last once coercive powers are eroded.
5484,然而，不尊重历史权利和要求的宪法或法律又会为未来的冲突和最终的分离做铺垫。族裔民族（ethnic nation）的思想往往孕育着悲惨事件诸如人口迁徙、领土瓜分和种族清洗的种子。,"A constitution or legislation that is not derived from respect for historic rights and claims will set the stage for future conflict and ultimate separation.The very idea of the ethnic nation carries with it the seed of traumatic events: population transfers, territorial partition and ethnic cleansing."
5485,在毛里求斯，黑白混血儿的境况也是以类似的两难困境为特征，他们混合了非洲人/欧洲人的出身，他们不被允许加入毛里求斯白人的种族群体，在总体上也不被克利奥尔黑人（非洲后裔）认为是优秀的克利奥尔人。,"In Mauritius, a similar dilemma characterises the situation of the gens de couleur or ""mulattoes""; people of mixed African/European origin.They are not allowed to join the ethnic community of Mauritian whites, nor are they generally perceived as good Creoles by the black Creoles (of African descent)."
5485,通常，他们被工人阶级的克利奥尔黑人描述为“Kreol fer blan”——也就是想要变白的克利奥尔人。,"Frequently, they are described by black working-class Creoles as kreol fer blan – as Creoles who try to be white."
5485,从全局的角度看，种族异类是分类的霸权系统的无助的“受害者”。,"Seen from a systemic perspectives, ethnic anomalies are helpless ""victims"" of a hegemonic system of classification."
5485,但是，从参与者的角度看，有时他们可以被当成是成功地成为两者的种族中间人，例如，既是印第安人也是非洲人而且可以在这些身份之间有策略地转换（Eriksen 1993a）。,"Seen from an actor perspective, however, they may sometimes be regarded as ethnic entrepreneurs who succeed in being both, say, Indian and African and switching strategically between these identifications (Eriksen 1993a)."
5486,对美国种族主义的控诉没有比查利˙明加斯的《受压迫者之下》（Mingus，1971）、劳尔˙萨利纳斯的“心灵牢狱之行”（Salinas，1969)、弗兰克˙钦（Frank Chin）那些愤怒的作品，以及詹姆斯˙韦尔奇（James Welch)或格拉尔德˙韦泽诺尔（Gerald Vizenor)对创伤的描绘，表达得更充分的了。,"No greater indictments of racism in America exist than Charlie Mingus's Beneath the Underdog, Raul Salinas's ""A Trip Through the Mind Jail,"" the angry writings of Frank Chin, the portraits of trauma by James Welch or Gerald Vizenor."
5486,然而，它们中没有一部作品仅仅是控诉，也确实没有一部作品只谴责了自我和族群之外的压迫者。所有人都想象性地描述了新的身份和世界的创造。,"None of these, however, merely indicts, and certainly none blames only oppressors outside the self and ethnic group; all Actively demonstrate the creation of new identities and worlds."
5486,并非幼稚地致力于直接再现，而是暗示或召唤文化的生成（emergence）(参见本书中泰勒的文章）。,"Rather than naive efforts at direct representation, they suggest orevoke cultural emergence (see Tyler in this volume)."
5487,民族志作者没有认识到他的陈述的权宜性质。,The ethnographer does not recognize the provisional nature of his presentations.
5487,他们确定其事。,They are definitive.
5487,他不会承认，“权宜的阐释”居然支持“权威的呈现”是一个悖论（这或许是因为，他坚持认为存在一个权威的读解）。这体现在阐释之中，他的呈现限制了再度阐释。,"He does not accept as a paradox that his ""provisional interpretations"" support his ""definitive presentations."" (It is perhaps for this reason that he insists on a final reading.) Embedded in interpretation, his presentations limit reinterpretation."
5487,民族志自我封闭。,Ethnography closes in on itself.
5487,甚至更有可能的是，民族学家基于民族志所提出的种种更为概括的理论，也只是那些用来呈现资料的权宜阐释的折射，充其量算是这些阐释在另一领域中扭曲的复制品而己。,"It is even possible that the more general theories the ethnologist generates from ethnography are only refractions, distorted repetitions in another register, of the provisional interpretations that support the presentation of data."
5487,必须承认，确实存在这种可能性。,The possibility must be entertained.
5487,赫耳墨斯是言说和书写的守护神，而我们知道，言说和书写本身就是阐释。,"Hermes was the tutelary god of speech and writing, and speech and writing, we know, are themselves interpretations."
5488,其他文章（泰勒关于口头和表演模式的文章、我自己关于寓言的论述）为了现在的用途征收了旧有的修辞和方案。,"Other essays (Tyler on oral and performative modes, my own treatment of allegory) recapture old rhetorics and projects for use now."
5488,“为了现在的用途！,"""For use now!"""
5488,”査尔斯˙奧尔森（Charles Olson)的诗学规则应该指导这些文章的阅读：它们是对变化中的当下处境的回应，是介入而不是立场。,"Charles Olson's poetic rule should guide the reading of these essays: they are responses to a current, changing situation, interventions rather than positions."
5488,如我在这里试图做的，将本书放在一个历史关节点上，是为了在没有关于历史发展的主导叙事这样的叙事——能为民族志提供一个内在一致的方向或未来——帮助的情况下，揭示它所站立的移动的地面。,"To place this volume in a historical conjuncture, as I have tried to do here, is to reveal the moving ground on which it stands, and to do so without benefit of a master narrative of historical development that can offer a coherent direction, or future, for ethnography."
5489,"后者和伊格纳提夫拔除民族主义的毒牙并使之无害的想法一样现实。法恩留给读者的是不安的恐惧：两者都没有好命运。从美国的多元文化主义（multiculturalism)到东帝汶的自决 (self-determination),族性、民族认同和国家主权之间的关系不断地引发人们讨论的激情。","This latter project may be no more unrealistic than Ignatieff's aspiration to draw the fangs of nationalism and render it benign, but Fine leaves the reader with the uneasy fear that both projects may be ill-fated.The relationship between ethnicity, national identity and state sovereignty continues to provoke passionate debate almost everywhere, from multiculturalism in the US to self-determination in East Timor."
5489,这本书不是试图解决这些问题，只是希望能够澄清它们。,"This book does not pretend to resolve such issues, but I hope it does something to clarify them."
5490,米歇尔˙福柯对于权力关系的研究为我们提供了某些有益的分析工具。,The work of Michel Foucault on power relations provides us with some helpful analytic tools.
5490,福柯（Foucault l982:212)在剥削、支配与主体之间作了区分。,"Foucault distinguishes between exploitation, domination, and subjection (1982: 212)."
5490,他认为，大多数权力的分析几乎无一例外地都集中在支配与剥削的关系上：谁在控制谁以及谁从生产者的生产中擭取成果，第三个术语：主体，集中在一个权力场域中离开力的直接应用最为遥远的向度上。,"He argues that most analyses of power concentrate almost exclusively on relations of domination and exploitation: who controls whom, and who extracts the fruits of production from the producers.The third term, subjection, focuses on that aspect of a field of power farthest removed from the direct application of force."
5490,权力关系的那一维度就是个体与群体的认同经受考验之所，那里也是体现最宽泛意义的秩序形态之所。,"That dimension of power relations is where the identity of individuals and groups is at stake, and where order in its broadest meaning is taking form."
5490,这是文化与权力最为紧密地交织在一起的王国。,This is the realm in which culture and power are most closely intertwined.
5490,福柯有时会称这些关系为“统怀”（governmentality），而这个术语便是一个有益的术语。,"Foucault sometimes calls these relations ""governmentality,"" and the term is a helpful one."
5491,布迪厄在声称跨越了结构与能动性之间的二分法的同时依然坚诗普适的客观主义。,While claiming to transcend the dualism between structure and agency Bourdieu remains firmly rooted in a communitarian objectivism.
5491,在声称反对回避个体行动的决定性逻辑的同时，正是后者（规则化的即兴表演的无意识约定）近乎于成为社会结构复制的媒介与表达；布迪厄对习惯的主体性由社会过程决定的陈述过于武断。,"While claiming to reject deterministic logic which eschews individual action, what there is of the latter (the intentionless convention of regulated improvisation) is merely a medium and expression of social-structural replication; what (habitual) subjectivity is allowed for in Bourdieu's portrayal is heavily overdetermined by social process."
5491,能动性被贬低为习惯性的对社会结构中的先决条件做出表面上被动消极的反应（Jenkins 1992)。,Agency is reduced to a seemingly passive power of reacting (habitually) to social-structural prerequisites (cf. Jenkins 1992).
5492,此外，很显然，不可能把所有事物都包含在描述中，即使你的目标是提供一种对该社会的全面说明并且安排了长篇大论于此。,"In addition, it would be plainly impossible to include everything in a description, even if one's aim is to provide a comprehensive account of a society and one has a thousand pages at one's disposal."
5492,让我们仔细研究内部看法和外部看法之间的关系。,Let us look a little more closely at the relationship between the view from within and the view from the outside.
5492,某种程度上，民族志的描述与受访者经历的这个世界的距离比分析更近些，因为后者完全是以对文化和社会的一般论述为目标的。,"Ethnographic description lies closer, in a sense, to the world as experienced by the informants than the analysis does, as the latter may ultimately aim at general statements about culture and society."
5492,这个层次——由该社会本身的成员自己经验和描述的生活——某些时候被称为“主位”观察；与其相对，外部观察者的分析式描述或解释，叫做“客位”观察层次。,"This level – life as experienced and described by the members of a society themselves – is sometimes spoken of as the ""emic"" level.Its counterpart, the analytical descriptions or explanations of the researcher, is the ""etic"" level."
5493,然而，从权力关系角度来说，不同社会之间存在显而易见并且意义重大的差别，不论是在公共领域还是私人领域。,"Yet there are obvious and clearly very significant differences between societies regarding power relationships, both in the public and the private spheres."
5493,区别权力概念化的两种主要方式是有帮助的。,It can be useful to distinguish between two principal ways of conceptualising power.
5493,更概括地说，社会的概念化也同样可以用两种主要的方式进行，后面的章节将会分别讨论到行动者的视角和系统的视角（特别是第六章）。,"More generally, society as such may be conceptualised in two chief ways, which are discussed later as the actor perspective and the systemic perspective, respectively (see especially Chapter 6)."
5493,社会可以被看做是有意识有目的行为的产物，也可以是制约所有行为的制度结构的总和。,"Society may be envisaged either as the product of intentional, willed agency, or as the totality of institutional structures which condition all agency."
5494,人们力图“公平地[处理]内在自我感受和外在手段的方式”(Wagner 1991:39)是詹姆斯·费尔南德斯（James Fernandez 1971，1977，1982）艰巨的研究工作的主题之一，主要集中于隐喻，并以“转喻理论”而著称。,"The way in which people do try to ""[do] justice to internal self- perception with external means"" (Wagner 1991:39) is the subject of a formidable body of work by James Fernandez (1971, 1977, 1982) which centres on metaphor and has become known as ""trope theory""."
5494,费尔南德斯说，并不仅仅只有人类学家才反对关于不可理解的个体生活的根本性唯我论和孤寂的论调，个体自己也一样反对。,"It is not just anthropologists who struggle against the fundamental solipsism and loneliness of incomprehensible individual lives, Fernandez begins, for individuals do so themselves."
5494,人存在的几个基本要素十分简单：我们面对的是处于世界之中的躯体的最初的身心体验。,The elemental vectors of human existence are simple: we project what are initially psycho-somatic experiences of the body out into the world.
5495,无论一种语言在命名和谈论事物方面多么有效，它在传递某类信息方面，在某种程度上都有缺陷，这呰信息是人们为理解所说的东西而必须了解的。,"Efficient though languages are at naming and talking about things, ail are deficient to some degree in communicating certain kinds of information people need to know to understand what is being said."
5495,由于这种原因，人类语言总是植根于我们与猴子和类人猿共享的那类姿势一呼叫系统。,"For this reason, human language is always embedded within a gesture-call system of a type we share with monkeys and apes."
5495,这种系统的各种各样的声音和手势起到“关键”言语的作用，它们为听者提供合适的框架以解释说话者正在说什么。,"The various sounds and gestures of this system serve to ""key"" speech, providing listeners with the appropriate frame for interpreting what a speaker is saying."
5495,借此，我们了解诸如说话者的年龄和性别这类情况，如果这正是我们已知的某个人的话，那么我们也得知他或她的个人身份。,"Through it, we learn information such as the age and sex of the speaker, as well as his or her individual identity if it is someone we already know."
5496,这些差异性的地位给他们带来了不同的利益。,These different positions give them different interests.
5496,像现在被普遍接受的，当代资本主义创造了这些利益聚散赖以存在的条件。然而，阶级意识作为唯一正确的意识所受到的最基本的批评是，阶级意识大多数情况下是利益意识。,"As is now generally accepted, contemporary capitalism has produced conditions whereby these interests become conflated and diluted.However, a more fundamental critique of the idea of class consciousness as the only true consciousness is that class awareness is predominantly an awareness of interest."
5497,在“田野工作叙述”中，经验的客观性修辞让位于自传和反讽性的自我写照（见 Beaujour 1980，Lejeune 1975)。,"With the ""fieldwork account"" the rhetoric of experienced objectivity yields to that of the autobiography and the ironic self-portrait.(See Beaujour 1980, Lejeune 1975.)"
5497,民族志学者，虚构作品中的一个人物，站在舞台中央。,"The ethnographer, a character in a fiction, is at center stage."
5497,他或她可以谈论以前被认为是“无关”的话题：暴力和欲望、疑 惑、斗争以及与被访人的经济交易。,"He or she can speak of previously ""irrelevant"" topics: violence and desire, confusions, struggles and economic transactions with informants."
5497,这些事情（在学科内部长久以来被非正式地讨论着）不再处于民族志的边缘位置，而被视为构成民族志的不可避免的成分（Honigman 1976）。,"These matters (long discussed informally within the discipline) have moved away from the margins of ethnography, to be seen as constitutive, inescapable (Honigman 1976)."
5498,沃克与翻译査尔斯˙尼内斯（Charles Nines)和理査德˙尼内斯（Richard Mines)以及托马斯˙泰昂（Thomas Tyon)和乔治˙索德（George Sword)——后两人用老拉科塔文写了扩展性文章一一有密切的工作关系。,"The ethnographer worked closely with interpreters Charles and Richard Nines, and with Thomas Tyon and George Sword, both of whom compose d extended essays in Old Lakota."
5498,后两人的文章现在首次翻译和出版了，在《拉科塔信仰与仪式》中，有很长的一节写的是泰昂从松树岭的许多萨满教巫师中得来的解释；这部分对于以不同的、异质的风格阐释信仰问题[例如“灵力”（wakan）]关键的和难以把捉的品质）提供了很好的启示。,"These have now been translated and published for the first time.In a long section of Lakota licliej'Tyon presents explanations he obtained from a number of Pine Ridge shamans; and it is revealing to see questions of belief (for example the crucial and elusive quality of ""wakan"") interpreted in differing, idiosyncratic styles."
5498,其结果是构成了一个抵制任何最终结论的、总是处于过程之中的文化版本，在《拉科塔信仰与仪式》中，编者提供了沃克的传记细节，包括为他提供资料来源的个人的线索，这些资料集自科罗拉多历史协会、美国自然历史博物馆和美国哲学协会,"The result is a version of culture in process that resists any final summation.In Lakota Belief the editors provide biographical details on Walker, with hints about the individual sources of the writings in his collection, brought together from the Colorado Historical Society, the American Museum of Natural History, and the American Philosophical Society."
5499,濡化是从自我意识（self-awareness）的发展开始的，自我意识是把自己识别为客体，对自己做出反应、评佔或评价自己的能力。,"Enculturation begins with the development of self-awareness—the ability to identify oneself as an object, to react to oneself, and to appraise or evaluate oneself."
5499,人们并不是生来就有这种能力的，尽管对在人类社会中生存来说，它是必不可少的。,"People do not have this ability at birth, even though it is essential for existence in human societies."
5499,正是自我意识使人们能对自已的行为采取负责的态度，学会如何对他人做出反应，并且承担各种角色。,"Self-awareness permits individuals to assume responsibility for their conduct, to learn how to react to others, and to assume a variety of roles."
5499,自我意识的一个重要方面是使积极的价值与自我相联系。,An important aspect of self-awareness is the attachment of positive value to the self.
5499,没有这种自我意识，就不可能激发个人采取对自己有利而非不利的行动;单凭自我认同，不足以做到这一点。,"Without this, individuals cannot be motivated to act to their advantage rather than disadvantage; self-identification alone is not sufficient."
5500,不过，我在此讨论的对文本化的寓言最具破坏性的挑战来自德里达的作品（Derrida 1974)。,But the most subversive challenge to the allegory o f textualization I have been discussing here is found in the work of Derrida (1974).
5500,或许他的“写作学”（grammatology)复兴最持久的影响，是扩大了传统上对何为写作的看法。,"Perhaps the most enduring effect of his revival of ""grammatology"" has been to expand what was conventionally thought of as writing."
5500,他认为，字母文字写作（Alphabetic writing)是一个限制性的定义，它将众多的符号、空间联结点、手势以及其他在人类文化中起作用的书写非常紧密地与言谈（speech)，即说/听的话的表述捆绑在一起。,"Alphabeti writing, he argues, is a restrictive definition that ties the broad range of marks, spatial articulations, gestures, and other inscriptions at work in human cultures too closely to the representation o f speech, the oral/aural word."
5500,德里达反对逻辑中心主义对写作（écriture）的表述，他彻底地将“书面语”的定义延伸，有效地模糊它和“ 口语”的截然区分。,"In opposing logocentric representation to écriture, he radically extends the definition of the ""written,"" in effect smudging its clear distinction from the ""spoken."""
5500,这里无需再详细地追溯一项令人迷失方向的工程了，它如今早已广为人知。,There is no need here to pursue in detail a disorienting project that is by now well known.
5501,换句话说，对身份变化的操控性使用存在限制。,"There are, in other words, real limits to the manipulative use of identity changes."
5501,改变宗教信仰和更换衣服是相对比较容易的。,It is relatively easy to change one's religion or one's clothes.
5501,虽然杜利特尔女士（Ms Doolittle）在 G·B·肖（G.B.Shaw)的 “皮格马利翁”（Pygmalion）中相当成功地做到了，但是改变一个人的口音、行为方式和语言是相对不易的。,"It is less easy to change one's accent, manner and language, though Ms Doolittle managed to do it with considerable success in G.B. Shaw's Pygmalion."
5501,改变一个人的外在形象、一个人的类型学特征是很困难的。,"It is very difficult to alter one's physical appearance, one's phenotype."
5502,多贡的村落也是按照家系团结起来的，而不是按照纯粹的政治和司法系统。,The Dogon villages are also integrated along lines other than purely political and judicial ones.
5502,所有成年男性都参加的宗教崇拜意义重大，人们认为建立和培育历史延续感很重要。村子的所有家系都可以溯根到一个遥远的祖先，据称是他发现了他们现在的定居点。,"The religious cults, in which all adult men participate, are significant.It is considered important to establish and nurture a sense of continuity with the past, and all lineages of a village can refer to a distant ancestor who allegedly founded their current settlement."
5502,土地被认为是祖先所有，所以不能买卖。,The soil is spoken of as ancestral land and it cannot be sold.
5502,这样，多贡的村落十分稳定。,"In this way, the Dogon villages become very stable."
5502,迁入或移出的移居传统上讲都是不寻常的。,In- and out-migration have traditionally been uncommon.
5502,这种模式在许多非洲农业民族当中得以蔓延，但是在20世纪，特别是第二次世界大战期间，情况发生了变化，主要是因为殖民主义、国家教育系统的发展和资本主义劳动力市场。,"This pattern has been widespread among many African agricultural peoples, but during the twentieth century, and particularly since the Second World War, it has changed, largely due to colonialism and the growth of a state educational system and a capitalist labour market."
5503,所有的人类社会都有专业人士——男女神职人员和萨满——来引导宗教实践，并介入超自然界。萨满是善于借助异常意识状态来接触和操纵超自然存在和力量的个体。,Ail human societies have specialists—priests and priestesses and/or shamans—to guide religious practices and to intervene with the supernatural world.
5503,他们所做的事有利于释放社会个体之间的紧张状况。,"Shamanism, with its often dramatic ritual, promotes a release of tension among individuals in a society."
5503,萨满为社会提供关注的焦点，有助于维持社会控制。,The shaman provides a focal point of attention for society and can help to maintain social control.
5503,萨满教对萨满的好处是便其获得声誉；有时候还使其拥有财富以及在艺术方面为其提供表现自我的途径。,"The benefits of shamanism for the shaman are prestige, sometimes wealth, and an outlet for artistic self-expression."
5504,只要我们呆在这个黑匣子里，那就不必担心匣子维度的问题。,
5504,,"As long as we stay within the box, we do not need to worry about its dimensions."
5504,从更一般的意义上说，就像博安南（Bohannan)指出的那样 (1973:358)，我们只需要关注那些文化性的事物本身，而没有必要考虑是什么使其具有文化性的。,"In the more general sense, and as Bohannan implied (1973:358), as long as we are concerned only with things cultural, we do not need to worry about what it is that makes themcultural."
5504,我们可以认为文化是包括宗教信仰、政治体系和亲属制度在内的一种范畴，并且讨论这些部分之间的相互关系，甚至可以完全不考虑文化的本质是什么，而是通过例证来对不同的社会进行比较。,"We can treat culture as the category that encompasses religious beliefs, political systems and kinship obligations, and discuss the relationships among these things, even drawing examples for comparison from different societies, without worryingabout what culture itself is."
5505,关于苏丹阿赞德人的屮巫术信仰以及在日常生活中维系这些信仰的理性，埃文思—普里查德有一个著名的论断：在他们信仰体系的环境和范围内，阿赞德人的推理毫无问题，但是他们无法在这些环境和范围之外进行推理或在其对立面进行推理，他们也没有这样做过（Evans - Pritchard 1950）。,"As Evans-Pritchard famously concluded concerning the witchcraft beliefs of the Azande of Sudan, and the rationality of maintaining those beliefs in daily practice: within the conditions and confines of their belief system, the Zande reason perfectly well, but they could not and did not reason beyond or against them (1950)."
5505,同样道理，“族群科学”（Frake 1980；Atran 1993）的目标是对特定空间里所具有的思维进行比较性的地域分类。,"In similar vein, the project of ‘ethnoscience’ (cf. Frake 1980; Atran 1993) set out to collate native categories of thought as constituted in particular places."
5505,世界上遵从规范建立起来的文化语法可以从基本的意义单元（等同于音素，有意义的发音的基本单元）中发掘出来：亲属关系的基本形式、植物和疾病的基本形式，甚至社会生活的基本轮廓。,"From elementary ‘units of meaning’ (equivalent to phonemes, the elementary units of meaningful sound), a cultural grammar for normatively constituting the world could be disinterred: from elementary terms for kinsfolk, plants and diseases, say, to the lineaments of social life."
5506,"我的第二个问题是与第一个问题密切相关的，但是从族性 (ethnicity)转移到民族性(nationhood),同样有一个为人广泛接受的观点：民族的确有一个长远而又绵延不断演进的历史进程，可以追溯到现代之前的时期，即使不是字面意义上的永恒。","My second question was closely related to the first, but transposed the issue from ethnicity to nationhood.Again, there is an almost universally held ""popular"" view which holds that nations, even if not literally eternal, do have a long and continuous history reaching well back into the pre-modern era."
5506,至少大多数欧洲人对他们本民族持有这样的观点，对邻近的民族也是这样。,"At least, most Europeans hold that view about their own nations, and usually about neighbouring ones as well."
5506,在这一点上，美国人持有几乎完全不同的观点。,American ideas on the subject are necessarily rather different.
5507,性别和年龄作为社会分化的基本准则，两者之间的一个重要区别是，你无意识间多多少少改变了你的年龄身份，却很少有人会改变性别。,"An important difference between gender and age as principles for social differentiation is the fact that one more or less automatically changes membership between age groups, while few people change their gender."
5507,在老人统治的旧世界，但却是另一种平等主义的社会里，男孩子们只要简单地等待年龄的逐渐变化，就可以获得全部的政治权利：他们可能合格地成为长老会的成员，并且可能最终成为强大的祖灵。,"In gerontocratic but otherwise egalitarian societies, boys may simply await their coming of age to achieve full political rights; they may be eligible to sit on the elders' council and may eventually become powerful ancestral spirits."
5507,在许多社会，这并非是女人可以拥有的选择。,This is not an option available to women in many societies.
5508,与世系群和氏族一样，联族和半偶族通常也实行外婚制，而且也靠婚姻使成员彼此联系在一起。,"Like clans and lineages, phratries and moieties are often exogamous and thus are bound together by marriages between their members."
5508,与氐族一样，它们也赋予其成员加入其他社区的权利，就像在霍皮人那里一样。,"And like clans, they provide members rights of access to other communities, as among the Hopi."
5508,在一个并不包含某人氏族成员的社区中，其联族成员在那里，仍可热情地接待他。,"In a community that does not include one's clan members, one's phratry members will still be there to turn to for hospitality."
5508,最后，半偶族之间也许会提供互惠的服务，就像在莫霍克人和其他 易洛魁民族（现在的纽约州所在地）中那样。,"Finally, moieties may perform reciprocal services for one another, as among the Mohawks and other Iroquoian nations of what is now New York State."
5508,在他们中间，如果一个半偶族中的某个成员死了，人们就会去请另一个半偶族的成员来参加必要的仪式。,"Among them, individuals turned to members of the opposite moiety for the necessary rituals when a member of their own moiety died."
5508,半偶族之间 的这种相互依赖性，同样有助于维持整个社会的整合。,"Such interdependence between moieties, again, served to maintain the integrity of the entire society."
5509,"根据我早先访问的经验，我决定把包办婚姻研究纳入我的计划之内。这一次，我遇到许多印度人夫妇，他们的婚姻是包办的,而他们看上去却很幸福。","From the experience of my earlier visit, I decided to include a study of arranged marriages in my project.By this time I had met many Indian couples whose marriages had been arranged and who seemed very happy."
5509,尤其是与我的许多美国已婚朋友（他们已身陷离婚过程之中）的命运相比，在我看来，包办婚姻的积极方面超过消极方面。,Particularly in contrast to the fate of many of my married friends in the United States who were already in the process of divorce the positive aspects of arranged marriages appeared to me to outweigh the negatives.
5510,似乎一直存在两种环境决定论，至少从本世纪初穆尔（Muir) 与平阔特（Pinchot)之间关于美国加州约瑟莫提国家公园（Yosemite National Park)里一条河流堤坝的辩论开始，“保守主义者” 与“保护主义者”之间便埋下了分歧的隐患（见Norton 1991:6—9)。,"It appears that there have always been two environmentalisms, or at least since the beginning of this century when the battle of words between Muir and Pinchot, over the damming of a river in Yosemite National Park, laid the foundations of a Small Places, Large Issuest between the ""conservationists"" and the ""preservationists"" (see Norton 1991:6–9)."
5510,保守主义者希望保留自然资源为人类所用，而保护主义者则意识到人类对自然本身的一种道德责任感，希望保护自然从而避免人类的破坏。,"While conservationists wished to protect nature as a resource for human use, preservationists recognized a moral obligation towards nature itself and wished to protect it from human use."
5510,这种分歧显而易见，因为人们在实践中将这种分歧体现出来，但是目前关于环境的争论在过去三十多年的发展中似乎一直没有什么特色，而两种环境决定论之间的关系显得更加不协调。,"This distinction was easy to recognize because it was played out in action—people took sides—but the current environmental debate, throughout its development during the past thirty years or so, appears to have been characterized by less distinct and more variable cleavages."
5510,其结果是，虽然分析者依然承认两种环境决定论，但他们承认的并不总是相同的两种环境决定论。,"The result is that, while analysts have continued to recognize two environmentalisms, they have not always been the same two."
5511,当文化流程通过汇聚、同化和综合而成长起來时，文化进展的速度便会增炔。,"As the stream of culture grows through accumulation, assimilation and synthesis, the rate of cultural advance increases."
5511,"例如，较之公元前90000年至87,000年间，公元前5000年至2000年间大都会地带的冶金和文字文化，其发明和发现更为众多，为数频繁；而且在今天，发明与发现又比较早时代的任何一个时期都更加频繁。","Thus, inventions and discoveries were much more numerous and frequent in the great urban, metallurgical and literate cultures of 5,000 to 2,000b.c. than in the period 90,000 to 87,000 B.C., and they are much more frequent today than in any earlier time."
5511,由于发明与发现既是文化环境的功能，又是人类智力的功能，因而具有优异质能的人相对来说在蒙昧时代比在文明时代更为重要和更有意义，因为文化资源比较缺乏，发明的难度就会更大。,"Since invention and discovery are functions of cultural milieus as well as of mental ability, it follows that men of exceptional intelligence were relatively more important and significant in the days of savagery than of civilization.Because the cultural resources were more meager, the difficulty of invention was greater."
5511,所以，我们可以将旧石器时代，而不是现代称为天才的吋代，因为那时先天才能的作用相对来说更为重要，虽说这个提法看上去可能有点荒谬。,"Thus, paradoxical though it may appear, the Old Stone Age might be called the Age of Genius, or Intelligence, rather than the present time because the role of native ability was relatively more important."
5512,政治的暴力有很多形式。,Political violence takes many forms.
5512,迈克尔•陶西格（Michael Taussig 1984)的研究涉及了因为恐怖行动、酷刑和集体屠杀而被边缘化和沉默的一些大型群体，他描写了有关南美洲的殖民主义和后殖民政府暴力的许多沉默的、无权的受害者。,"The marginalisation and muting of large groups through terror, torture and massacres has been dealt with by Michael Taussig (1984), who writes about the many silent, powerless victims of colonialism and postcolonial state violence in South America."
5512,布鲁斯˙卡普费热（Bruce Kapferer 1988)在对斯里兰卡的一项研究中分析了作为内战的政治暴力，他展示了被妖魔化的泰米尔人（Tamil)的形象是如何被锡兰人（Sinhalese)的民族主义者创造出来并添油加醋的，后者对古老的锡兰神话和神圣的背景使用了特定的解释以支持泰米尔人是魔鬼的观点。,"Political violence as civil war has been analysed in a study of Sri Lanka by Bruce Kapferer (1988), who shows how the image of the demonic Tamil is nourished and created by Sinhalese nationalists who use particular interpretations of ancient Sinhala myths and sacred texts to support the view of Tamils as devils."
5513,比较方法更多是分析性的。,The comparative method is more analytical.
5513,它尽力将那一混合物概括成模式和原则。,It tries to reduce that mixture to patterns and principles.
5513,它也会设法过滤被比较的文化中的相似性和差异性，并理解它们对文化的参与者意味着什么。,"It tries to sift out the similarities and differences among compared cultures, and comprehend what those mean to participants of the cultures."
5513,当人类学家在民族志体验及民族志书写中变得越来越“可见”时，他们可能也会更多地参与其中，代表那些被研究的人行动。,"While anthropologists become more ""visible"" in the ethnographic experience and in its writing, they may also become more engaged, acting on behalf of those being studied."
5513,民族志学者经常会参与到人、公共健康和他们的合作者的政治权利中去。,"Ethnographers often get involved in the human, public health, and political rights of their informants."
5514,这种以论坛形式出现的研究鼓励大家在同一领域展开类似的工作，因为只有这样才有助于更多的新理论的出现。,"The appearance of studies in such a forum encourages emulation, and emulation can produce fruitful new theories."
5514,因此我们希望这套丛书能在众多的争鸣中成一家之言，并为不同学科有志于比较符号学的学者提供一个可以言说的园地。,"It is therefore our hope that the series will serve as a house of many mansions, providing hospitality for the practitioners of any discipline that has a serious and creative concern with comparative symbology."
5514,各学科常常被枯燥乏味、迂腐的学究氛围所笼罩从而各自封闭起来，彼此间缺乏真正有益的学术影响。,"Too often, disciplines are sealed off, in sterile pedantry, from significant intellectual influences."
5515,1857 年索绪尔生于日内瓦 ， 在那里他学习了物理 和化学。之后到莱比锡学习比较语言学，又到巴黎教授语言学。1891 年，他回到出生地。,"Saussure (de Saussure) was born in Geneva in 1857.He studied there (initially, physics and chemistry) and in Leipzig (comparative philology), and he taught philology in Paris before returning to his native city in 1891."
5515,在有生之年，他以对印欧语系元音体系的共时性和历时性的研 究而著称。,In his lifetime he was best known for comparative and historical studies on Indo-European vowel systems.
5516,这样，民族权力可以跨越国界，而不需要打破现存的国家。,"Thus some ""national rights"" could cut across state borders, without breaking up existing states."
5516,北爱尔兰的“美好星期五协约”——从高特莱博撰写这一章节开始谈判——提供了他梦寐以求的理想安排的案例。,"The Good Friday agreement in Northern Ireland, negotiated since Gottlieb’s chapter was written, provides an example of the kind of arrangements he had in mind."
5516,为与高特莱博进行讨论，我邀请了尼尔·麦考密克（Neil MacCormick），他不仅是爱丁堡大学钦定讲座法学教授，还是苏格兰民族党的指路明灯。,"To debate with Gottlieb I invited Neil MacCormick, who besides being Regius Professor of Law at Edinburgh is a leading light in the Scottish National Party."
5517,但是，这听起来容易，做起来却很难。,"However, this answer is not as simple as it sounds."
5517,这必须由某个人或某个势力来决定在哪个地区举行公民投票，决定向公民提出什么问题。,"Someone, and usually some power, has to decide in what area such a plebiscite should be held, and what question should be asked."
5517,而这通常差不多等于决定边界线应该划到哪里。,This often comes close to a decision on where the boundary line should run.
5517,是否举行投票，在哪儿举行投票，这些问题的争议都很大。,"The question of whether, and where, to hold such plebiscites is extremely controversial."
5518,一旦承认反思性是普遍的人性的一部分，作为人们的一种手段和实践方式随处可表达他们对特定社会文化环境看法，作为一种语言公开表达自己的感受。那么如同拉比诺（Paul Rabinow 1977:151-2)所说的，自我的人类学有其存在的理由。,"Once reflexivity is allowed as a universal part of human consciousness, a means and a practice by which people everywhere come to look askance at the particular socio-cultural milieux and languages in which their self-expressions find overt form, then, as Rabinow puts it above (1977:151–2), auto-anthropology comes into its own."
5518,这并非政治策略的工具，也不是为了找到更好表述他者的人类学表述而采取的技巧和地点转换，而是对整个人类学发展潜能至关重要的一部分。,"Here is not merely an instrument of political correctness, or a technique or location for better anthropological representation of otherness, but something fundamental to the potentiality of the anthropological enterprise as such."
5519,博厄斯人类学派的一个分支把分类学的认知方面作为自己的关注点。,One of the offshoots of Boasian anthropology has been the interest in cognitive aspects of classification.
5519,这更加强了博厄斯派与拉德克利夫－布朗派观点的对立。因为博厄斯派强调文化是一种思维的方式，而拉德克利夫－布朗强调认为文化只不过是社会结构的一个次要的附属物。,This interest highlights the sharp divide between the Boasian emphasis on culture as a way of thinking and the Radcliffe-Brownian emphasis on it as a minor adjunct to social structure.
5520,"对布鲁斯˙克瑙夫特(Bmce Knauft)而言，关键术语是“批判人文主义的敏感性""（critically humanist sensibilities)，他想借此说明的是“对互斥的人文主义观点的自觉运用，以牵制它们各自的过度使用”(1996,48)。","For Bruce Knauft the key term is critically humanist sensibilities.What he means by this is ""the self-conscious applicationof...competing humanist perspectives to keep their respective excesses in check"" (1996, 48)."
5520,特别是“对文化多样性的重视和对不平等的批评为彼此提供了制约和平衡”(1996，53)。,"Specifically, ""appreciations of cultural diversity and critiques of inequality provide checks and balances on each other"" (1996, 53)."
5520,"克瑙夫特相信这“两手抓”的方法既保证了“客观主义在处理文化差异时不失为一种精确而先进的手段” (1996，61),同时又避免了“后现代主义中的超相对主义”(1996，105)。","This two-pronged approach, Knauft believes, maintains ""objectivism as a rigorous and progressive tool"" (1996, 61) for engaging cultural difference while avoiding the ""hyperrelativism of postmodernism""(1996, 105)."
5521,他使我们认识到，在一些其他的批评立场（它们也具有自身独特的盲点）所不具有的重要方面，后现代主义者对自身的位置（situation)和“定位性”（situatedness）—无所知，因为作为后现代主义者，他遵循一种带有偏好的、易变的信条，对于这一信条来说，一个人的自身位置或诸如此类之物已经如此的不稳定、不具备认同感以至于它们无法再被当作持续性反思的对象。,"Said another way, Jameson enables us to see that in important ways not shared by other critical stances (which have their own characteristic blind spots) the post-modernist is blind to her own situation and situatedness because, qua post-modernist,she is committed to a doctrine of partiality and flux for which even such things as one's own situation are so unstable, so without identity, that they can not serve as objects of sustained reflection."
5521,后现代的拼凑模仿既是一种批评立场，同时也是我们当代世界的一个方面。,Post-modernist pastiche is both a critical position and a dimension of our contemporary world.
5521,詹明信的分析帮助我们建立起对它们之间的联系的解释，从而避免了怀旧情绪和将一种非常具体的历史情境普遍化和本体论化的错误。,"Jameson's analysis helps us to establish an understanding of their interconnections, thereby avoiding both nostalgia and the mistake of universalizing or ontologizing a very particular historical situation."
5522,很难想象，不引用族性的概念，怎样思考非洲问题。,It seems that we cannot manage to think about Africa without invoking ethnicity.
5522,确实，有些人认为，对研究族性的学者来说，非洲是如此有用，因为部落制从远古传到了今天，只是不完整地让位给了宗教、民族或阶级认同。,"Some people, indeed, claim that Africa is so useful to students of ethnicity because tribalism has persisted there from antiquity to the present, only imperfectly giving way to confessional, national or class identities."
5522,因此，对这些人来说，非洲的族裔还处于其原始状态。,"Hence, for them, African ethnicity is ethnicity in its primal state."
5522,我正好反对这个观点。,I shall make exactly the opposite claim.
5522,对于族性的研究者来说，非洲的重要性是因为那里的族性是最近才存在的。,Africa is invaluable to students of ethnicity precisely because that ethnicity is so recent there.
5523,异族通婚的群体从定义上就可以知道，男人要从群体之外获得女人。,Exogamous groups must by definition obtain women from outside.
5523,在许多社会，财产、遗产和政治公职都跟随男人，而且是由男人正式决定谁该与谁结婚。,"It is a fact that property, inheritance and political office tend to follow men in most societies, and that men often take the formal decisions regarding who is to marry whom."
5523,因此，即使居住模式是从妻居（也就是说，新郎入赘新娘的家），女人的婚姻归宿往往也是由其兄弟和其他男性亲戚所决定，即使这些男人和他们的妻子住在另一个村子里。交换妇女的最简单形式就是交换姐妹：我把我的姐妹给你，你也把你的姐妹给我。,"So even if the pattern of residence should be uxorilocal (that is, the groom moves in with the bride's family), the woman's brothers and other male relatives tend to determine her matrimonial destiny, even if they live with their wives in a different village.The simplest form of woman exchange would consist in the exchange of sisters: I give my sister to you, and you give me yours in return."
5523,在家系社会中，交换妇女的是以团体为单位而不是以个人。,"In lineage societies, it is corporations rather than persons who exchange women."
5523,如果一个社会由两个相互间有规律地交换妇女的家族群体组成，这个社会就可以分为两个半偶族。,"If a society consists of two kin groups who regularly exchange women between them, the society is divided into moieties."
5524,在此，新郎的家族不得不转让一些资源给新娘的家族，作为对拥有新娘的劳动力和生殖力的一种回报。,Here the groom's kin is obliged to transfer resources to the bride's kin in return for his rights to her labour and reproductive powers.
5524,彩礼的给付使男人对女人及其孩子拥有了权利。,The payment of bridewealth establishes the rights of the man in the woman and her children.
5524,如果没有给付彩礼，婚姻可能会无效，而传统上，在彩礼上的不一致意见是许多民族之间长期不和的一个常见原因。,"If the bridewealth is not paid, the marriage may be void, and disagreement over bridewealth payments is traditionally a common cause of feuds among many peoples."
5524,在彩礼较为常见而男方亲属较为强悍的社会，兄终弟及的转房婚（levirate）可能会发生。,"In societies where bridewealth is common and the agnatic kin group is strong, the levirate may occur."
5525,尼采接着说，人类阐释所采取的形式是多种多样的。,"The form human interpretations take, Nietzsche continues, are various."
5525,哲学家的书当然是其中一种，而且还包括其他人各种各样习惯性的实践和生活模式。,"The books of the philosopher, certainly, but also the various habitual practices and modes of life of others."
5525,在承认样式和形式的丰富性的同时只有一件事是惟一的：即丰富性将会继续。,Amidst the profusion of versions and forms there is only one singularity: the continuation of profusion.
5526,格尔茨（Geertz 1983）将常识的运作看作是“一个文化体系”。,"Geertz, for instance (1983), has elaborated upon the workings of common sense ‘as a cultural system’."
5526,他说，常识看起来似乎是平常的事实；其实是经验的直接表达方式，是“任何具备正常头脑的人都能够明白的”。,
5526,,"Common sense, Geertz begins, claims to apprehend reality matter-of-factly; it is but the immediate deliverances of experience, what ‘anyone in their right mind could see’."
5526,可是，对“平常的事实”和那些被视为理所当然的现象进行跨文化的比较，就能立刻发现这里存在着一个特殊的文化体系：一个有秩序的受到认可的思维模式、通过教授和习得的符号信息体系，其实践过程差不多就是不断重复某个理论上的契约，或者提出逻辑上的证据。,"However, cross-cultural comparison of what is ‘matter-of-fact’ and to be taken-for-granted quickly reveals that here is a specific cultural system: an ordered body of considered thought, a set of symbols and messages taught and learnt, whose practice is as much an accomplishment as reciting a theological covenant or following a logical proof."
5527,我们可以在民族志的圈内轶闻中听到这个故事的不同版本，而且版本还在增加。突然之间，文化资料不再是顺利地从口头表演发展到描述性写作现在，资料也从文本到文本，铭写（inscription）变成了抄写（transcription)。被访人和研究者都是读者，也都是文化创作的改写者。这并不是说(有些人可能会这样说），访谈的结果是在原地转圈，我们也不需要，就像苏格拉底在《斐德罗篇》里那样，凭借读写能力（literacy）来哀悼记忆的侵蚀。,"Versions of this story, in increasing numbers, are to be heard in ""in the folklore of ethnography. Suddenly cultural data cease to move j smoothly from oral performance into descriptive writing. Now data also move from text to text, inscription becomes transcription. Both informant and researcher are readers and re-writers of a cultural invention. This is not to say, as some might, that the interview has ended in a sterile short circuit. Nor need one, like Socrates in the Phaedrus, lament the erosion of memory by literacy. The interview has not, suddenly, become ""inauthentic,"" the data merely imposed."
5527,访谈并没有突然变成“非本真的”，只是加了些资料。,
5527,相反，我们必须考虑的是民族志生产的新条件。,"Rather, what one must reckon with are new conditions of ethnographic production."
5528,于是，后现代民族志作者通过参与性文本——没有谁在其中拥有概括的超越性的唯一权力——所力求唤起的正是参与性现实的这种回音。,"It is this echo, then, of participatory reality that post-modern ethnography seeks to evoke by means of a participatory text in which no one has the exclusive right of synoptic transcendence."
5528,因为后现代民族志是参与的和创生的，所以它不可能有一种预定的形式；因为可能发生这样的事，即参与者也许会认定文本化本身是不适当的——因为过去有如此之多的报道人，然而他们的异议极少被认为是重要的，相反却被当作民族志作者单声部文本的障碍物。,"Because it is participatory and emergent, post-modern ethnography cannot have a predetermined form, for it could happen that participants might decide that textualization itself is inappropriate — as have many informants in the past, though their objections were seldom taken to be significant in themselves, being treated instead as impediments to the ethnographer's monophonic text."
5528,不论文本采用什么形式——如果有的话——它都会强调响音相对性，不仅是在文本与它属于其中一部分的话语共同体之间——“文化相对论”的通常意义——而且还作为一种文本的构成特征存在于文本内部,"Whatever form the text takes — if any — it will stress sonorant relativity, not only between the text and the community of discourse of which it is a part — the usual sense of ""cultural relativity"" — but within the text itself as a constitutive feature of the text."
5529,对佩诺布斯科特人来说，所有这一切都完全是不可避免的。例如，一个猎手单独去森林中过一段相当长的时期，在晚上就可能听到像涓泽女帕斯克德玛斯那样的哭叫声。,"To the Penobscot, all of this was quite believable; the lone hunter, for example, off for extended periods in the forest, could hear in the night what sounded like the cry of Fskedemus, the swamp woman."
5529,因而佩诺布斯科特人接受了这种事实，即他或她的灵魂在躯休睡着时四处 游荡，与各种各样的超自然物相互作用。,"And a Penobscot accepted as fact that his or her spirit routinely traveled about while the body slept, interacting with various of these supernatural beings."
5530,最初的人依据他们自己的心灵以解释事物与事件。,The first men interpreted things and events in terms of their own psyches.
5530,然而，他们并不曾意识到其解释的立足点；相反，他们极力坚持，引发他们经验的诸事件不是他们自己的心灵，而是神灵志怪的心灵。,"They were not aware of their standpoint of interpretation, however; on the contrary, they insisted emphatically that the minds to which the events of their experience were attributed were not their own, but those of spirits, of gods or demons."
5530,然而，这不过是人类自我向外部世界的投射而已。,"They were, however, merely the projection of the human ego into the external world."
5530,例如，全部射而已。例如，全畴，都被解释为心性、精神、愿望、意志和目的的表现。,"Thus the whole cosmos, the entire range of experience, was interpreted as the expression of mind and spirit, of desire, will and purpose."
5530,这就是泛神论和超自然论，然而，首先还是拟人论。,"This was the philosophy of animism and supernaturalism, but above all, of anthropomorphism."
5531,人们既可作为社会参与者加入这些象征性的行为，也可作为一名旁观者，参加与否完全出于自愿——仪式活动所形成的内部群体由于暂时摈弃了外部的诸多规则和义务的束缚，因此具有愉悦欢快的特点，从而更易于被个体有意识地吸收和接受。,To be either their agents or their audience is an optional activity—the absence of obligation or constraint from external norms imparts to them a pleasurable quality which enables them all themore readily to be absorbed by individual consciousnesses.
5531,“愉悦”因此成为变革性的转变这一语境之下颇为重要的一个因素。在本书中我并没有对这一话题详加论述，然而我对复杂社会的变革的关注（我将朝圣的过程置于12世纪的英格兰、19世纪的墨西哥、中世纪时期的印度以及中古和现代的欧洲及亚洲等不同背景下加以考察）已经表明了这一结论的正确性。,"Pleasure thus becomes a serious matter in the context of innovative change.In this book I have not taken up this point, but my concern with complex societies in change (twelfth-century England,nineteenth-century Mexico, medieval India, medieval and modern Europe and Asia as settings for pilgrimage processes) points toward this formulation."
5532,在朝圣者漫长的徒步旅行的过程中，他通常会受到各种激励，从而思考圣人或神灵的各种创造性的和完全利他的行为，神灵或先贤们已留下的圣物以及他们的图画、塑像是朝圣者的追求之物。,"The pilgrim becomes himself a total symbol, indeed, a symbol of totality; ordinarily he is encouraged to meditate as he peregrinates, upon the creative and altruistic acts of the saint or deity whose relic or image forms the object of his quest."
5532,朝圣者的举动类似于柏拉图所谓的回忆这一概念，即对从前的一种状态的追忆。,"This is, perhaps, akin to the platonic notion of anamnesis, recollection of a previous existence."
5532,然而在朝圣这一语境中的记忆却是朝圣者全身心地参与到一种神圣状态中的体现， 其目的是为了求得自身灵魂与躯体、神圣与完整的统一。,"However, in this context it would be more properly regarded as participation in a sacred existence, with the aim of achieving a step toward holiness and wholeness in oneself, both of body and soul."
5533,如果我们把前往某一特定圣殿朝圣的大多数香客生活的地理区域比作一个受托区（catchment area），欧洲圣地的受托区当然比麦加这一朝觐中心的受托区小得多。,"But if one can speak of a catchment area as a metaphor for the geographical area from which the majority of pilgrims are drawn to a particular shrine, the catchment areas of European pilgrim centers were certainly much smaller than Mecca's."
5533,欧洲曾经一度是民族一国家出现之前极为重要的地区性朝圣中心。,Europe was the continent of the great regional and protonational pilgrimage centers.
5533,根据埃瓦尔˙多斯（Ivor Dowse）在《英格兰香客的圣殿》（The Pilgrim Shrines of England）一书中的记载，中世纪时期仅英格兰就有至少74个香火旺盛的圣地和圣殿，而在新教改革之前的苏格兰则有32个[Dowse，《苏格兰香客的圣殿》（The Pilgrim Shrines of Scotland，1964)],"We find that, according to Ivor Dowse, The Pilgrim Shrines of England (1963), there were in England alone during the medieval period at least seventy-four well-attended pilgrimage sites and shrines, and in Scotland, before the Protestant Reformation, thirty-two (Dowse, The Pilgrim Shrines of Scotland, 1964)."
5534,只需列出某类别中的所有组成成员，我们就可以定义任何一个类别。但这是不够的。,"One could define any class simply by listing all its members, but this is hardly satisfactory."
5534,认识分类的原则才更有意义。这可从语义和成分中显示出来。,"Much more useful is an understanding of the principles of classification, and these are indicated in the significata or components."
5535,芝加哥的城市模型的特殊性受到了越来越多的批评。,"The particularity of the city in the Chicago model was to come under increasing attack, however."
5535,难道没有更多的城市化方式需要考虑吗？工业城市不同于前工业，西方不同于非西方，殖民不同于后殖民，等等。,"Were there not many urbanisms to consider: the industrial city as distinct from the preindustrial city, the Western city as distinct from the non-Western, the colonial as distinct from the post- colonial, and so on?"
5535,难道这种多样性不会抵制归纳概括吗？(比如，原本认为城市里的亲属是地缘的社会制度，这种观念已经被无归属的策略所取代与将城市和乡村看作两个不连续（类型）的社会系统相比，难道不是将他们的关系看作是横跨社会一经济结构的体系更精确吗？,"And did not this diversity mitigate against reductive generalization (such as, for instance, the notion that in the city kinship as a load-bearing social institution was superseded by non-ascriptive measures)?Instead of treating the urban and the rural as two discrete (types of) social system was it not more accurate to plot their relations in one overarching set of socio-economic structures?"
5536,程式跳转中发生的是一个既定的研究程式达到一个临界点，这个时候哪怕在最好的从业者的作品中也没有任何新的或令人兴奋的东西出现。,What happens in agenda hopping is that a given agenda of research reaches a point at which nothing new or exciting is emerging from the work of even the best practitioners.
5536,并不是说旧有程式是完善的，也不是说标新立异的观念太多已经到了泰然处之的地步。,"It is not that the old agenda is completed, or that too many anomalies have accumulated to proceed with equanimity."
5536,相反，程式跳转的发生是由于越来越多的人认  识到从业者已经开始理解他们正在调查的现象是非常复杂的。,"Rather, what has happened is that as more and more has been learned the practitioners have come to understand that the phenomena being investigated are quite complex."
5537,脑量显著大于能人的脑量，相当于较低级的现代人脑容量。,The brain size was significantly larger than of H. habilis and well within the lower range of modern brain size.
5537,齿系完全是人类的，尽管按现代人标准看是相对人的。,"The dentition was fully human, though relatively large by modern standards."
5537,就如人们可以料到的，考虑到直立人的较大的脑，它在文化发展中超过了其前辈。,"As one might expect, given its larger brain, H. erectus outstripped its predecessors in cultural development."
5537,在非洲，奥尔德沃文化的斧头转化为比较精致的手斧（石器时代相当于“制作较好的引人注目的新产品”）。,"In Africa, the Oldowan chopper was transformed into the more sophisticated hand ax (the Stone Age equivalent of ""building a better mousetrap"")."
5537,在欧洲的各个地方，斧子工具不断被制造出来，但是后来，在非洲和欧洲，手斧似乎都得到进一步的修改和发展。,"In parts of Europe chopper tools continued to be made, but, later, in both Africa and Europe, the hand ax appears further refined and developed."
5538,现在应该转到我前面提到的概念问题上。,"It is time now to turn to the question of perception, which I flagged earlier."
5538,对原生论者来说，主观因素向行动者自己提出了族性含义问题。,"For the primordialists, the subjective dimension turns on the question of the meaning of ethnicity to the actors themselves."
5538,族裔差异看上去是原生的、基本的、深入每一个社会人的内心深处的；当然，这不是站在观察者的角度，而是站在族裔交流和冲突的参与者的角度来看的。,"Ethnic differences are seen to be primordial, fundamental, reaching to the very heart of one's social being; seen of course not by the observer, but by the participants in ethnic interactions and conflicts."
5539,而在这个地区农业民族的宗教仪式和通行观念中，女神起核心作用。,"By contrast, goddesses played central roles in religious ritual and the popular consciousness of the region's agricultural peoples."
5539,与这些女神相联系的是光、爱、多产和生殖这些概念。,"Associated with these goddesses were concepts of light, love, fertility, and procreation."
5539,"在公元前1300年左右，犹太人部落进入迦南之地,开始从事农耕，这就要求他们与上地建立一种新的关系。","Around 1300 B.C., the Hebrew tribes entered the land of Canaan and began to practice agriculture, requiring them to establish a new kind of relationship with the soil."
5539,因为他们为获得谷物开始仰赖降水和四季更替，开始关注多产（就像迦南人先前那样），他们采纳了迦南人的许多女神崇拜。,"As they became dependent upon rainfall and the rotation of seasons for crops and concerned about fertility (as the Canaanites already were), they adopted many of the Canaanite goddess cults."
5539,尽管这与犹太人原初的宗教崇拜完全对立，但对迦南女神的信仰，通过设法控制多产的力量以利人们生活幸福，迎合了人们对安全的渴望。,"Although diametrically opposed to the original Hebrew cult, belief in the Canaanite goddesses catered to the human desire for security by seeking to control the forces of fertility in the interest of peoples' well-being."
5540,如同双胞胎或三胞胎的父母（他们因此也是异类）被看成是人和灵魂世界之间的中介者一样，穿山甲被视为人类和动物世界之间的中介者。,"Just as the parents of twins and triplets (who are also anomalies on this score) are seen as mediators between the human and the spiritual worlds, the pangolin is seen as a mediator between humanity and the animal world."
5540,异类通常与危险和污染相联系。,Anomalies are usually associated with danger and pollution.
5540,比如道格拉斯在另一个地方描述的例子（1966），是中东宗教中的猪：作为一种偶蹄但不反刍的哺乳动物，它没有被归类为是可以吃的动物，因为可食用的动物应该既是偶蹄的又是反刍的——它没有按照这种规则。,"One example, described by Douglas elsewhere (1966), is the pig in Middle Eastern religions: as a cloven-hoofed but not ruminant mammal, it was not classified as edible since edible animals ought to be both cloven-hoofed and ruminant – it was an anomaly."
5540,道格拉斯认为，穿山甲的肯定得多的地位是由于以下事实：厘哩人（Lele）成功地将一个潜在的祸因转变成了神恩，将动物的模糊身份开发成它们的优势。,"The rather more positive status of the pangolin is caused by the fact, Douglas argues, that the Lele have succeeded in turning a potential curse into a blessing, exploiting the ambiguous status of the animal to their advantage."
5540,穿山甲在经济上并不重要，然而却在厘哩人的宇宙观里占据了一个核心地位：它是中介者。,"The pangolin is not economically important, and yet it occupies a central place in Lele cosmology: it is a mediator."
5541,当英国的清教徒在北美洲建立他们的殖民地——新普利茅斯——的时候，如果印第安人不教他们如何种植美洲的原产作物玉米的话，他们很有可能就饿死了。,"When the Pilgrims established their colony of New Plymouth in North America, they very likely would have starved to death had the Indian Squanto not showed them how to grow the native American crops—corn, beans, and squash."
5541,一个社会的成员向另一个社会借用文化元素的过程，叫作传播。而贡献文化元素的社会实际上就是那种元素的“发明者'借用是如此常见，以至于已故北美人类学家拉尔夫˙林顿说，任何一种文化的90%的内容都可以通过借用得到说明。,"The borrowing of cultural elements from one society by members of another is known as diffusion, and the donor society is, for all intents and purposes, the ""inventor"" of that element.So common is borrowing that the late Ralph Linton， a North American anthropologist, suggested that borrowing accounts for as much as 90% of any culture's content."
5542,在考古学界，瑞典学者奥斯卡•蒙特柳斯 在19世纪80、90年代，完善了欧洲新石器时代和青铜时代的类型学。,"In archaeology, Swedish writer Oscar Montelius, in the 1880s and 1890s, refined the typology of the European Neolithic and Bronze Ages."
5542,他指出，遍布欧洲的地区变体和细节的细微发展可以被说明是由于传播而不是因为进化（参见 Trigger 1989: 155 - 61 )。,"He argued that regional variations and specific small developments across Europe could be accounted for by diffusion, rather than by evolution (see Trigger 1989: 155–61)."
5542,"在民族学中，事情更加微妙，但是回顾一下历史很重要。摩尔根认为亲属称谓主要依赖于迁移和传播，泰勒也经常谈到传播，并将文化描述为具有“黏附力"" (adhesions) 的，或者说文化要素经常在一起被发现。","In ethnology, things were more subtle, but it is important to recall that Morgan’s thinking about kinship terminologies depended heavily on both migration and diffusion, and Tylor often spoke of diffusion and described cultures as having ‘adhesions’, or elements of culture usually found together."
5543,格里奥勒喜欢启用大量的助手和同事来观察一项仪式，把他们安排在不同的角度上观察，从而获得对参与到这项活动当中的不同群体的一个总体看法。,"Griaule would often use a range of assistants and colleagues at a ritual, placing them at different points in order to obtain an overall view of the activities of the different groups involved."
5543,"虽然最初受到了传播论的影响，但是他很快就拋弃了这种观点，而青睐于后来克利福德所说的“共时性文化模式”(Clifford 1983,122)。","Although influenced originally by diffusionism, he soon abandoned it in favor of an emphasis on what Clifford calls ""synchronic cultural patterns"" (1983, 122)."
5543,他还强调可以把成年礼仪式普遍看作是踏人当地文化的人口，这个原则后来被热尔梅娜˙迪耶泰朗（Germaine Dieterlin)以及他的其他追随者们继续贯彻了下去。,"He also stressed initiation rituals as an entry point into indigenous cultures generally, a principle that Germaine Dieterlin and other followers of his perpetuated."
5544,应该说清楚，我并没有提倡根据作者的传记对民族志进行还原式阅读。,It should be clear that I am not advocating a reductive reading of ethnographies in terms of the biographies of their authors.
5544,业内人确实可能参照他们对于作者的了解调整他们对于民族志的阅读。,It is true that professionals may adjust their readings of ethnographies according to their knowledge of the writers.
5544,这 使阅读更丰富更有见地。,This makes reading richer and more informed.
5544,它允许读者将贯注作者的许多细微的差异、心照不宣的理解、暗含的视角带进文本——如柏拉图可能说的，给一个死的文本带来了更丰满的生命，但对于随随便便或头脑简单的读者，根据作者的传记来阅读民族志可能是不公平的、破坏性的，会把文本简化掉而不是丰富了它。,"It allows the reader to bring to the text many of the nuances, tacit understandings, and implicit perspectives that informed the writer—to bring, as Plato might say, a dead text to fuller life.But in the case of casual or unsophisticated readers, reading in terms of the biography of the writer can be invidious and destructive, explaining away the text rather than enriching it."
5545,世界上有大量艺术表现形式和模式。,An enormous variety of forms and modes of artistic expression exist in the world.
5545,因为世界各地的人们一直在创造和发展新的东西，所以没有迹象表明，人类学家捜集和描述世界上各种艺术表现形式的兴趣有丝毫减少，这些艺术表现形式包括：装饰品、身体装饰、服饰变化、各种毯子图案、陶器和竹篮的风格、建筑上的修饰、纪念碑、仪式面具、传奇、劳动歌曲、舞蹈以及其他的艺术形式。,"Because people everywhere continue to create and develop in new directions, no point of diminishing returns is foreseeable for the interesting process of collecting and describing the world's ornaments, body decorations, variations in clothing, blanket and rug designs, pottery and basket styles, architectural embellishments, monuments, ceremonial masks, legends, work songs, dances, and other art forms."
5545,但是，这种搜集过程最后必须要引出对艺术和文化其他部分之间关系的某种分析和概括。,"The collecting process, however, eventually must lead to some kind of analysis and generalizations about relationships between art and the rest of culture."
5546,对其成员资格有所限制的继嗣群体，不论其怎样计算继嗣，通常并不仅仅只是提供情感支持和归属感的一群亲属。在非工业社会中，它们是紧密组织起来的工作单元，这种单元能够在人们艰苦和不确定的生活中提供安全保障和服务。,"Descent groups with restricted membership, regardless of how descent is reckoned, are usually more than mere groups of relatives providing warmth and a sense of belonging; in nonindustrial societies they are tightly organized working units providing security and services in what can be a difficult, uncertain life."
5546,继嗣群体做的事是多方面的。,The tasks descent groups perform are manifold.
5546,"除了作为经济单元为其成员提供相互帮助的机会之外, 它们还为年老体弱者提供支持，并在婚丧嫁娶之时帮一把手。","Besides acting as economicunits providing mutual aid to their members, they may support the aged and infirm and help with marriages and deaths."
5546,它常常能够决定一个个体可以与谁结婚或不可以与谁结婚。,"Often, they play a role in determining who an individual may or may not marry."
5546,继嗣群体还可以作为宗教传统的保存者。,The descent group also may act as a repository of religious traditions.
5546,"例如,袓先崇拜通常是强化群体团结的强有力的力量。","Ancestor worship, for example, is a powerful force acting to reinforce group solidarity."
5547,那些在很大程度上使传统保持不变的民族，例如，其不变的程度比注重实效而足智多谋的萨米人还要高的话，它想要长期存在的机会就很渺茫，因为它在与现代霸权国家的遭遇过程中缺少有效的应对策略。,"Peoples who retain their traditions unaltered to a greater extent than, for instance, the pragmatic and resourceful Sami,stand a much smaller chance of survival in the long run, since they have no effective strategy for handling their encounter with the hegemonic, modern state."
5547,这个关于土著政治学的奇怪的悖论观点涉及一个更加普遍的关于族群性和民族主义的悖论，也就是，文化和文化身份没有一对一的关系，尽管两者是相连的。,"This odd paradox of indigenous politics relates to a more general paradox of ethnicity and nationalism, namely that there is no one-to-one relationship between culture and cultural identity, although the two are connected."
5547,传统和传统主义之间的不同可能有助于我们理解这种差别。,The distinction between tradition and traditionalism may help us to underst and the difference.
5548,一个著名的船货崇拜的例子是新赫布里底群岛（New Hebrides）的约翰·弗拉姆（John Frum）活动(Worsley 1968，pp.152–60）。,"One famous cargo cult is the John Frum movement in the New Hebrides (Worsley 1968, pp. 152–60)."
5548,从文化的层面上说，它可以被描述为是基督教、本土宗教和消费主义的一种混合物。,"At the cultural level, it can be described as a mixture of Christianity, indigenous religion and consumerism."
5548,活动中的许多成员是名义上的基督徒但却对基督教的微薄回报感到失望，基督教主要提供了没有切实结果的祈祷和歌曲。,"Many of the members of the movement were nominal Christians but were disappointed by the modest returns of Christianity, which chiefly offered prayers and songs with no tangible consequences."
5548,因此，1940年代早期，坦拿（Tanna）的男人开始组织集会等候先知约翰·弗拉姆的消息，他被指望将大家从英国殖民地上解救出来并重建被取缔的传统习俗，引入一种新的“带有椰子印记的”货币并确保物质商品（货物）的富足。,"Early in the 1940s therefore, Tanna men began organising meetings where they awaited messages from the prophet John Frum.He was expected to liberate them from the colonial domination of the British, re-establish the outlawed traditional customs, introduce a new currency 'with a coconut stamp' and ensure abundance of material goods (cargo)."
5549,在从母居的情况下，男子通常并不远离生养他们的家庭，所以他们时不时可以回去帮忙。,"Under matrilocal residence, men usually do not move very far from the family they were raised with, so they are available to help out there from time to time."
5549,因此，婚姻通常不会包括对新郎家庭做出补偿。,"Therefore, marriage usually does not involve compensation to the groom's family."
5549,两可居（Ambilocal residence）适应这样的情况：核心家庭不能提供经济合作所需的足够多的人，而资源在某种程度上又是有限的。,Ambilocal residence is particularly well suited to situations where economic cooperation of more people than are available in the nuclear family is needed but where resources are limited in some way.
5549,因为新婚夫妇既可以加入新娘的家庭，又可以加入新郎的家庭，所以家庭成员的身份是不固定的，他俩可以住在资源最优或者最需要他们劳动力的家庭中。,"Because the couple can join either the bride's or the groom's family, family membership is flexible, and the two can live where the resources look best or where their labor is most needed."
5550,在伍尔芙对存在的瞬间的记述中，真正重要的是她将经验的个体放在了核心地位。,What is significant in Woolf’s account of moments of being is its centralizing of the experiencing individual.
5550,她可能和周围的人一样牛活在一些整齐有序的时间单位当中；她可能在与别人的互动中也将这些时间单位当作常规形式来对待：但对于她生命中的经验时间，她的解释和主张都独立于、很可能不同于别人。,"She might live in moments as formal units of time just as those around her, and she might deal with these units as conventional forms in her interaction with others, but the experiential time of her life, notwithstanding, she construes and maintains independently of, and most likely differently to, others."
5550,最终，她生命中的重要时刻只属于她一个人。,"Ultimately, the significant moments of her life are hers alone."
5551,威尔逊将许多生物学思想的线索汇集到一起，像达尔文一样思考人性理解的意蕴。,"Wilson pulled together a variety of strands of biological thinking, and like Darwin considered the implications for the understanding of humanity."
5551,但与达尔文不同的是，他着眼于人类文化的整体。,"Yet unlike Darwin, he took on the whole of human culture."
5551,威尔逊认为，运用达尔文的原则，有可能与解释白蚁、青蛙或狼的社会生活儿乎相同的方式来解释文化。,"Wilson argued that the application of Darwinian principles makes it possible to explain culture in much the same way as one explains the social life of termites, frogs, or wolves."
5552,社会方言是在较大群体内的一群人的语言，这群人中所有人可能说或多或少相同的语言。,"A social dialect is the language of a group of people within a larger group, all of whom may speak more or less the same language."
5552,社会语言学家感兴趣的是，方言差异是否反映文化的差异。,Sociolinguists are concerned with whether dialect differences reflect cultural differences.
5552,他们几乎出于同样的原因，也研究代码转换——当处境要求时，语言从一个层面向另一个层面转变的过程。,They also study code switching—the process of changing from one level of language to another as the situation demands—for much the same reason.
5552,关丁于语言起源的一种理论是，早期原人——借助于也由类人猿和猴子展现的发展中的潜能——由于他们两足直立行走，使于，得以解放，他们用姿势作为手段， 开始在社会环境里进行交流并贯彻各种意图。,"One theory of language origins is that early hominines, by developing potentials exhibited also by apes and monkeys, with their hands freed by their bipedalism, began using gestures as a tool to communicate and implement intentions within a social setting."
5553,北美人长期以来一直把家庭看作是至关重要的一个核心社会制度。今天家庭却成了争议和讨论的对象。,"The family, long regarded by North Americans as a critically necessary core social institution, today has become a matter of controversy and discussion."
5553,妇女不再呆在家里带孩子，而是走出家庭去工作赚钱，情侣们——有时是同一性别的——非婚同居，高离婚率，还有越来越多的单亲家庭——这些问题对家庭在北美社会中的功能以及家庭在快速的社会变迁时期的存在能力提出了质疑。,"Women taking jobs outside the home rather than staying home with children, couples living together without the formality of marriage, soaring divorce rates, and increasing numbers of households headed by a single parent have raised questions about the functions of the family in North American society and its ability to survive in a period of rapid social change."
5554,父系继嗣（有时叫作男性继嗣）是两种单系继嗣体系中较为常见的一种。,Patrilineal descent (sometimes called agnatic or male descent) is the more widespread of the two unilineal descent systems.
5554,一个父系继嗣群体的男性成员经由该群体中的其他男性来追溯源于共同祖先的血统（参见图10.1）。,The male members of a patrilineal descent group trace through other males their descent from a common ancestor (Figure 10.1).
5554,兄弟和姐妹属于他们的祀父、他们的父亲、他们父亲的兄弟姐妹，以及他们父亲的兄弟的孩子那个继嗣群体。一个男子的儿女同样也是经由男子一系来追溯他们源于共同祖先的世系。,"Brothers and sisters belong to the descent group of their father's father, their father, their father's siblings, and their father's brother's children.A man's son and daughter also trace their descent back through the male line to their common ancestor."
5554,在一个典型的父系群体中，父亲或他的长兄拥有对子女的权威。,"In the typical patrilineal group, the responsibility for training the children rests with the father or his elder brother."
5554,"一个女子与她父亲及父亲的兄弟属于同一个继嗣群体, 但她的孩子却不能通过他们来追溯继嗣。","A woman belongs to the same descent group as her father and his brothers, but her children cannot trace their descent through them."
5554,比如说，一个人的姑母的孩子，是通过姑母的丈夫所属的父系群体來追溯继嗣的。,"A person's paternal aunt's children, for example, trace their descent through the patrilineal group of her husband."
5555,"这种园艺技术，以刀耕火种闻名，是世界上最普通的技术之一。北美的早期欧洲殖民者从周围的印第安人那里继承了这种方法,尽管在欧洲远古时期，人们也一直应用这一方法。","This gardening technique, known as slash-and-burn agriculture, is one of the most common in the world.The early European settlers in North America adopted the method from the surrounding Indians, although it had been used in an earlier period in Europe as well."
5555,在某个时期，批评家指责这种技术是浪费的而且破坏生态，但是今天我们知道，特别是在湿润的热带，刀耕火种农业可能是最好的园艺技术之一。,"At one time critics condemned the technique as wasteful and ecologically destructive, but today we know that, especially in the humid tropics, slash-and-burn agriculture may be one of the best gardening techniques possible."
5556,他说，流言蜚语是一个由文化决定并进行传递的过程，是一种社会車实，具有约定俗成的规则和重要的功能。,"Gossip, Gluckman begins, is a culturally determined and sanctioned process, a social fact, with customary rules and with important functions."
5556,值得注意的是，流言蜚语有助于维系群体的统一、道德和历史。,"Notably, gossip helps maintain group unity, morality and history."
5556,流言蜚语的本质是借助公共传统的预期不断的（非止式或间接的）从负面对行为进行评价和判断。,"For, the essence of gossip is a constant (if informal and indirect) communal evaluation and reaffirmation of behaviour by assessment against common, traditional expectations."
5557,提夫人的不同经济领域或者说是道德经济的崩溃，带来了价值更加宽泛的可比性，这些价值在以前是不可比较的，种类上也不同。,"The collapse of the economic spheres, or the moral economy, of the Tiv entailed a wider comparability of values formerly regarded as incommensurable, as different in kind."
5557,因此，经济失去了它的道德特征并逐渐脱离了最初建构了它的文化价值。,The economy thereby lost its moral character and was gradually disengaged from the cultural values which had originally constituted it.
5557,纯粹的供应和需求的市场原则代替了“高级”和“低级”价值之间的区别的同时，也取代了正确和错误的规则。,"Pure market principles of supply and demand replaced rules of right and wrong as well as distinctions between ""high"" and ""low"" values."
5557,不过，因为普遍用途货币的引入，提夫人也能够通过在比以前大得多的范围之内的交易而获得经济交往。,"Because of the introduction of general purpose universal money, however, the Tiv were also enabled to communicate economically through trade on a much larger scale than before."
5557,铜条，是提夫人以前的特殊用途货币，在他们的部落范围以外就毫无价值，而英镑（后来是尼日利亚的奈拉[nairas]）在更广大的区域里具有同样的价值。,"The brass rods, the former special purpose money of the Tiv, had no value outside their tribal area, whereas pounds sterling (and later Nigerian nairas) had the same value over an enormous area."
5557,提夫人种植的芝麻种子在普遍用途货币引入之后能够卖给临近城市里的批发零售商，并且最终有可能出现在伯明翰人的早餐桌上。,The sesame seeds grown by a Tiv after the introduction of general purpose money could be sold to a wholesale retailer in the nearest city and might eventually end up on a breakfast table in Birmingham.
5558,在德国启蒙运动中具有强烈人类学相关性的第二阵营里也盛行着非殖民主义和经验性兴趣：对非欧洲语言的语言学研究的兴起。,"Noncolonial, empirical research interests also prevail in the case of the second class of innovations of strong anthropological relevance in the German Enlightenment: the rise of philological studies of non-European languages."
5558,固然，德语的语言学研究代表了一种单独的、更强烈的自成一体的传统。,"To be sure, philological studies of German represented a separate, much stronger tradition of their own."
5558,"研究在17世纪扩展开来，形成了语言研究社团的广泛分布 (Fricke 1993)，它们将内部平等主义的结构同德语语言纯化论—— 实际上还有“语言学爱国主义”——的意识形态结合起来（Garber 1996,30)。","They had expanded in the seventeenth century, leading to the wide distribution of linguistic societies (Fricke 1993) that combined an inner egalitarian structure with an ideology of German language purism and, in fact, of ""linguistic patriotism"" (Garber 1996, 30)."
5558,正是在这种早期的情境中，数学家兼哲学家戈特弗里德˙莱布尼茨（Gottfried Leibnitz)在17世纪就提出语言的结构和说这种语言的人的智力成就间存在相关性的论断。,It was out of these earlier contexts that mathematician and philosopher Gottfried Leibnitz had already postulated in the seventeenth century a correlation between the structure of a language and the intellectual achievements of its speakers.
5559,家族的声誉至上看来是基本原则。,The basic rule seems to be that a family's reputation is most important.
5559,人们明白，配偶只有在同一种姓和一般社会阶级内部加以安排，如果新娘与新郎家族的阶级地位是相似的话，种姓分支之间稍有交叉也是允许的。虽然印度现在法律禁止嫁妆，但每次婚姻都发生范围广泛的礼物交换。,"It is understood that matches would be arranged only within the same caste and general social class, although some crossing of subcastes is permissible if the class positions of the bride's and groom's families are similar Although dowry is now prohibited by law in India, extensive gift exchanges took place with every marriage."
5559,"即使男青年家庭没有“提出要求”,每个姑娘的家庭仍感到有义务送给姑娘、男青年和男青年家庭传统的礼物。","Even when the boy's family do not ""make demands,"" every girl's family nevertheless feels the obligation to give the traditional gifts, to the girl, to the boy, and to the boy's family."
5560,人们普遍认为，种姓制度作为一种等级制度，将所有印度人口分成了四个主要的群体，不同的种姓（the varnas，梵文意思是“色彩”）：婆罗门（Brahmin，教士）等级最高，接下来是刹帝利（Kshatriyas，武士和统治者）、吠舍（Vaishyas，商人）和首陀罗（Shudras，艺术家和工人）。,"It is common to think of the caste system as a hierarchy dividing the entire Hindu population into four main groups, the varnas (a Sanskrit word meaning ""colour"").The Brahmins (priests) have the highest rank, followed by the Kshatriyas (warriors and kings), the Vaishyas (merchants) and the Shudras (artisans and workers)."
5560,完全不在种姓系统之内、这个等级的最底端，是所谓的贱民（Untouchables），之所以用这样的英语单词称呼他们，因为高级种姓的成员在接触到这种污染的人之后，要不得不经受一套复杂的净化仪式才行。,"Outside the varna system proper, at the very bottom of the ladder, are the so-called Untouchables, labelled thus by the British because a high-caste person had to go through an elaborate purification ritual after having touched such a polluting person."
5560,三种高级种姓的成员被认为是“出生两次的（twice-born）”，因为他们参加过一个使精神再生的典礼。,"Members of the three highest varnas are called ""twice-born"" because they have gone through a ceremony entailing spiritual rebirth."
5561,虽然，从实际情况来看，今天许多美拉尼西亚人比起100年以前已经富裕了很多，但是相对来说，他们可能更贫困了，他们的贫困是相对的。,"Although many Melanesians are better off in absolute terms today than they were a hundred years ago, they may be worse off in relative terms.They have been relatively deprived."
5561,当富裕被理解为是一种确定的可能性的时候，贫困成为一个更大的问题。,Poverty becomes a greater problem the moment wealth is perceived as a definite possibility.
5561,在社会科学中，通常会采用通常现代化（modernisation）或帝国主义（imperialism）（也可参见第十三章）视角来看待富裕的北半球国家与贫穷的南半球国家之间的冲突。,"In the social sciences, it has been common to regard encounters between rich, Northern and poor, Southern peoples either in terms of modernisation or in terms of imperialism (see also Chapter 13)."
5561,前一种视角，在发展经济学家沃尔特·罗斯塔夫（Walt Rostow 1965）的著作中得到体现，他预先假定了一种单线的进化观点，据此，贫穷国家最终将会“赶上”“发达世界”。,"The former perspective, exemplified in the work of the development economist Walt Rostow (1965), presupposes a unilineal evolutionary view according to which the poor countries would eventually ""catch up with"" the ""developed world""."
5561,北方和南方之间的经济和政治接触因此是有好处的，因为它将导致南方国家的“发展”。,"Economic and political contact between North and South would then be beneficial, since it would lead to the ""development"" of the Southern countries."
5562,随着“正在全球化的”第三世界国家互相竞争创造出口型经济，它们经常是积极地强制执行命令或秩序。,"As ""globalizing"" third world nations compete with one another to create export-oriented economies, they are frequently aggressive in enforcing order."
5562,这些行动经常为第一世界的政治家和科研人员所厌恶，只因为它们被第三世界的政府认为是必须的。,"These actions are frequently abhorrent to first world politicians and academics, just as they are defended by third world governments as necessary."
5562,在这一辩论中，人类学并没有置身其外。,Anthropology is not an uncompromised player in this debate.
5562,人类学对文化相对论的强烈捍卫，已经创造了一个社会科学基础，被许多第三世界政府用来辩护他们的行为是独特地适应当地文化价值和环境的。,Anthropology's strong defense of the concept of cultural relativism has created a social scientific basis for many third world governments to defend their actions as uniquely adapted to local cultural values and circumstances.
5563,西方工业化国家正在日益同化来自第三甚至第四世界的移民：西班牙人涌入北美洲，西部印地安人和东印度人来到英国，土耳其人则涌向德国。,"Western industrialized nations are increasingly assimilating migrants from the third and even the fourth world: Hispanics pour into North America; West Indians and East Indians come to England; and Turks, to Germany."
5563,所有这些迁移，带来了新的人际关系问题及经济问题。,All of these migrations bring new problems of human relations as well as economics.
5563,人类学在有着广泛直接体验的学术学科中，实际上是单独通过田野工作及构成世界人口多数的世界文化，日益影响着我们的生活。,"Anthropology is virtually alone among academic disciplines in having extensive, immediate experience, through fieldwork, with the world cultures that constitute the majority of the world's population and increasingly impact on our lives."
5564,一位苏人学者小瓦因˙德洛里亚（Vine Deloria Jr.)代表所有的美国土著，用他的著作《卡斯特因你的罪而死》一书打响了头炮（1969)。,"Vine Deloria Jr., a Sioux scholar, fired the opening salvo on behalf of all Native Americans with his Custer Died for Your Sins (1969), in which he accused anthropology of exoticizing the Indians."
5564,在这本书中，他指责了人类学对印第安人的异国情调化，他的攻击触怒了人类学家但也引起了他们对研究正当性问题的关注，包括有必要更充分地将土著人的看法纳人到人类学中。,"His attack raised the hackles of anthropologists but also drew their attention to legitimate concerns, including the need to better incorporate native perspectives into anthropology."
5564,一些年后，另外一位代表人类学研究对象说话的非人类学家，即爱德华˙萨义（Edward Said)，以其《东方学》 (1978)—书扮演了大致相同的角色。,"A few years later, another nonanthropologist speaking for the subjects of anthropological study, Edward Said, played something of the same role with his Orientalism (1978)."
5564,萨义德认为西方学术界已经将亚洲丰富多彩的社会精练和均质为一幅与理性的西方形象相对立的神秘的、给人以美感的东方形象。,"Said argued that Western academics had essentialized and homogenized the diverse societies of Asia into an image that counterposed a mysterious, sensuous Orient with the rational West."
5565,因此，在美国社会，3个人长大的时候，不论你是如何思考它的，他们都已得到一条明确的信息；成功的来临在某种程度上以别人受损为代价。,"Thus, by the time individuals have grown up in U.S. society, regardless of what they may think about it, they have received a clear message: Success comes at someone else expense."
5565,就如人类学家科林·特恩布尔评论的：在学校体育运动（或者在校外的少年棒球联合会）中，“甚至如此大声吹嘘的团队精神，也只不过是一种更为有效的方式，以通过有限的合作，去更柯效地‘击败’更大多数的人。,"As anthropologist Colin Turnbull observed: ""Even the team spirit"", so loudly toutedin school athletics (or out of school in Little League baseball and the like), ""is merely a more efficient way, through limited cooperation, to 'beat' a greater number of people more efficiently."""
5565,”总而言之，独立训练一般鼓励个人去寻找帮助和关心，而不是给出帮助和关心，而鼓励个人努力施加个人的支配力。,"In sum, independence training generally en-courages individuals to seek help and attention, rather than to give it, and to try to exert individual dominance."
5566,据说，在队群内生活时间最长的那些人“拥有”上地，他们通常是一群兄弟姐妹或表兄弟姐妹，然而，他们的所有权与其说是实实在在的，不如说是象征性的。,"The land is said to be ""owned"" by those who have lived the longest in the band, usually a group of brothers and sisters or cousins.Their ownership, however, is more symbolic than real."
5566,他们不能买卖土地。然而，外来人必须征得他们的许可才能进入他们的领土。,"They cannot sell (or buy) land, but outsiders must ask their permission to enter the territory."
5566,虽然拒绝这种许可很不可思议。,"To refuse such permission, though, would be unthinkable."
5567,在我已讨论的所有个案中，民族志作者的自画像在很多方面被神秘化了。,"In all the cases I have discussed, much is mystified in the ethnographer's self-portrait."
5567,很多东西被讽刺、被间接地质疑，但从未被明指——特别是这一点：从他者的立场来看，民族志作者出现在当地是完全不可理解和不合常理的。,"Much is ironized, indirectly questioned, but never named—notably the sheer inexplicability and unjustifiability of the ethnographer's presence from the standpoint of the other."
5567,埃文思-普里査德在他的前言中固执地曲解与一个被访人的对话，便是最清楚的例子了。,Evans-Pritchard's dogged misreading of a conversation with an informant in his preface could provide no clearer example.
5567,同样被神秘化的是更宏观的欧洲扩张计划，不论民族志作者自己的态度如何，他们是被卷人这一计划的，而且这也决定了民族志作者自己与所研究群体之间的物质关系。,"Equally mystihed is the larger agenda of European expansion in which the ethnographer, regardless of his or her own attitudes to it, is caught up, and that determines the ethnographer's own material relationship to the group under study."
5568,我们的确发现了更富有挑战性的看待文化的新方法，透过表述理论对意义和其他宏大叙事的阐释，很多人类学家开始关注日常行为的对话和诗性。,"What we do find can be much more challenging, and, as one antidote to the treatment of culture through the lens of representational theories of meaning and other grand theory, many anthropologists today are focusing upon the dialogics and poetics of everyday behaviour."
5568,其基本要点是关注（各种程度和形形色色）特定生活方式下的人们的生活、经历、思考。,"In so doing the primary concern is with living, experiencing, thinking, affectively engaged human beings who follow (in varying degrees and a myriad of manners) particular lifeways."
5568,这与那些试图获得“客观”抽象结构的方法相对立，后者在构建结构时消解了世界其他的必要部分。,It is antagonistic toward all those attempts to create ‘objective’ abstract structures that have the effect of dismissing much of what the rest of the world has to say.
5569,文化因素将被引入政治科学，但不会引入法律， 因为它是排他的和变迁的。,"The cultural factor should be introduced into political science, but not into law because it is elusive and transitional."
5569,在“多元文化主义”方面，我们将抛弃“文化主义”，保留“多元”。,"In ""multiculturalism"" we should drop ""culturalism"" but keep the ""multi""."
5569,首先，“文化共同体”概念在时空上的含义是多种多样的。,"First of all, the notion of a ""cultural community"" varies too much both in time and in space."
5569,在斯里兰卡的泰米尔人和僧加罗人中的文化多样性难题与大不列颠的相关问题之间存在着哪些共同点？,What is there in common between the problematics of cultural diversity among Tamils and Sinhalese in Sri Lanka and in Great Britain?
5570,人们普遍认为是让-弗朗索瓦˙利奥塔（1924—1998)在一份为魁北克省大学理事会撰写的关于科学知识形势的报告当中创造了“后现代主义”这个词（Lyotard 1984)。,"Jean-François Lyotard (1924–1998) is generally credited with coining the term postmodern, in a report on the state of scientific knowledge for the Council of Universities in Quebec (1984)."
5570,后现代风格本身被认为是在有趣味的、本土化的和折中式设计取代现代主义者们的一丝不苟的实用主义设计风格之时而首先兴起于建筑学领域。,"Postmodern style itself is supposed to have started in architecture as playful, vernacular, eclectic designs took the place of the severe utilitarian designs of the modernists."
5570,它随后波及了文人们普遍认为是让-弗朗索瓦˙利奥塔（1924—1998)在一份为魁北克省大学理事会撰写的关于科学知识形势的报告当中创造了“后现代主义”这个词（Lyotard 1984)。,
5570,后现代风格本身被认为是在有趣味的、本土化的和折中式设计取代现代主义者们的一丝不苟的实用主义设计风格之时，而首先兴起于建筑学领域。,
5570,它随后波及了文学和其他艺术类别领域，为了颠覆现代主义者关于高雅文化（high culture)的观念而推崇各种大众文化和亚文化。,"It was later transferredto literature and other genres, with popular and subaltern cultures being celebrated in order to subvert the modernist notion of high culture."
5570,在更晚些时候，社会科学家们发掘了它并将其当作一个工具以理论勾勒当代生活大多数领域内多元趋向性（multistrandedness)，这包括了诸如多元文化主义、全球化、认同的归化（hyphenation of identities)以及各种霸权结构的去中心化（殖民主义的、资本主义的、以性别为基础的、种族的，等等）等因素。,"Later still, social scientists discovered it as a tool for theorizing about the multistrandedness of much contemporary life, including such elements as multiculturalism, globalization, hyphenation of identities, and the decentering of hegemonic structures of all sorts (colonial, capitalist, gender-based, racial, and so on)."
5570,总之，后现代主义高扬无序而非有序、分化而非统一、多样性而非一致性、相对主义而非标准化、平等而非霸权。,"In short, postmodernism celebrates chaos not order, fragmentationnot unity, variety not uniformity, relativism not standardization, and equality not hegemony."
5571,事实上，依附训练与独立训练是一个统一体的两个极端，特殊处境可以分享二者的各种要素。,"In actuality, dependence and independence training represent extremes along a continuum, and actual situations may partake of elements of both."
5571,例如，在寻食社会中，儿童养育实践结合二者的各种要素。,"In food-foraging societies, for example, child-rearing practices combine elements of both."
5571,"“分享一切”是正常的秩序,因此竞争行为被劝阻，因为它可能与所有其他人所依赖的合作相抵触。","""Share and share alike"" is the order of the day, so competitive behavior, which can interfere with the cooperation all else depends on, is discouraged."
5571,因此，婴儿从成人那里获得许多积极的、充满深情的照料，同时得到长期的口头满足。,"Thus, infants receive much positive, affectionate attention from adults, along with prolonged oral gratification."
5571,这种情况，以及由于顺从的较低压力和不太强调竞争，与在现代工业和后工业社会中经常出现的情况相比，鼓励个人有更多的相互支持和帮助。,"This, as well as low pressure for compliance and a lack of emphasis on competition, encourages individuals to be more supportive of one another than is often the case in modern industrial societies."
5572,首次创新是对一些新原理的偶然发现——例如黏士经火焙烧能够变得永久坚硬这一发现。,"Primary innovations are chance discoveries of new principles—for example, the discovery that the firing of clay makes the material permanently hard."
5572,二次创新是通过对已知原理的应用而带来的改进——例如，用已知的技术将黏土烧铸成人们所熟悉的物体。,Secondary innovations are improvements made by applying known principles.
5572,首次创新可以促进快速的文化变迁，并激发其他发明。,
5573,约翰·戴维斯（John Davis 1992b）的一篇有趣的文章表现了一种不同的、对于互惠和市场交换的经典二分法的更加根本的批评。他有力而优美地反驳了被他视为在给予礼物和市场交换之间所做的一种武断区分。,"A different, more fundamental critique of the classic dichotomy between reciprocity and market exchange is represented in a fascinating essay by John Davis (1992b), who argues forcefully and elegantly against what he sees as an arbitrary distinction between gift-giving and market exchange."
5573,他赞成最早由莫斯提出而后被萨林斯（Sahlins 1972）深入发展的设想，其中，更宽广的交换的社会和文化语境得以揭露，并显示了非工业经济必须从文化的角度被加以理解。,"He is sympathetic to the project initiated by Mauss and developed further by Sahlins (1972), where the wider social and cultural contexts of exchange are revealed and where it is shown that non-industrial economies must beunderstood in cultural terms."
5574,虽然流派众多，但法国人类学学派的确从涂尔干在1880年代所设立的观念那里获取了可观的理论一致性，这种观念最初是为社会学设立的，后来由涂尔干自己和莫斯应用到人类学上，又在二战后由列维-斯特劳斯以结构主义的形式加以发展。,"Although multistranded, the French school does draw considerable theoretical unity from the precepts laid down for sociology in the 1880s by Durkheim, applied to anthropology by himself and by Mauss thereafter, and developed by Lévi-Strauss through structuralism after World War II."
5574,这种影响甚至可以在那些乍看起来摈弃了这些观念的作者们的作品中被探查到。,This influence can be detected even in the work of those authors who at first sight appear to reject these precepts.
5574,于是，像福柯、布尔迪厄、博德里亚尔和德里达这样的作者都曾以一种让人回想起涂尔干对仪式中的象征符号的解释（更别说回想起卢梭）的方式谈论过意识形态与意象的内化，而戈德利埃则强调了结构主义与马克思主义之间的相似性。,"Thus writers like Foucault, Bourdieu, Baudrillard, and Derrida all have talked of the internalization of ideologies and images in a manner that recalls Durkheim's interpretation of symbols in a ritual, not to mention Rousseau, while Godelier has highlighted the similarities between Marxism and structuralism."
5574,的确，许多所谓的后结构主义思想家一方面批评了结构主义，一方面又扩展了它，这乃是因为一种持续的借助二元对立来进行思考的倾向，即使他们的思考目的正是为了解构这种对立，或至少是解构它们被认为代表着的那种不平等。,"Indeed, many so-called poststructuralist thinkers extended structuralism as much as criticized it, thanks to the persistent tendency to think in terms of binary oppositions even when the intention is to deconstruct them, or at least to deconstruct the inequalities they are seen to represent."
5574,因此，从卢梭一直到博德里亚尔存在着延续性，其间有赖于诸如涂尔干和列维-斯特劳斯这样的重要人物作为中介。,"There are thus continuities from Rousseau through to Baudrillard, mediated by major figures such as Durkheim and Lévi-Strauss."
5575,古希腊人的二元论，与希伯来人的“创造”观形成鲜明对比。,Greek dualism was in sharp contrast to the Hebrew notion of creation.
5575,希伯来人将整个世界都看成是上帝耶和华的活动场所，因此，从一个非物质的精神世界中分离出来一个封闭的物质世界的想法，对他们来说比较陌生。,"The Hebrews saw the world as an arena for the activity of God, Yahweh, so that the idea of a ""closed"" material world separate from a nonmaterial spiritual world was foreign to them."
5575,然而，希伯来人在文化的观念上则作出了不少贡献。,"Nevertheless, the Hebrews contributed to the idea of culture."
5575,在他们的创造观念中，人是“按照上帝的形象”被创造，并被上帝赋予统治地球的权力。这样，人就与非人区分开来。,"In their view of creation, man was made ""in the image of God"" and given dominion over the earth.The human was distinguished from the nonhuman."
5576,不过，列维-斯特劳斯对心理学的运用是集体性的而非个体性的，谈论的是蕴涵在表面的文化多样性之下的基本思维模式。,"Lévi-Strauss's use of psychology is, however, collective rather than individual, a matter of basic modes of thought that underpin superficial cultural variations."
5576,列维-斯特劳斯将对这种广义心理学的运用与泰勒式的文化观念以及索绪尔式的结构主义相结合，使得他能够完成莫斯提出的在法国把人类学确立为一门独立学科的任务，恰如涂尔干六十多年前确立社会学一样。,Lévi-Strauss's use of this generalized psychology in combination with a Tylorian view of culture and Saussurean structuralism enabled him to complete Mauss's work of establishing anthropology as a separate discipline in France as Durkheim had established sociology some sixty years earlier.
5576,从这个意义上说，列维-斯特劳斯是继涂尔干之后第二位对法国人类学具有重要意义的伟大创新者，而且在我看来，他应该也能与涂尔干、韦伯和马克思三位并驾齐驱，成为第四位社会科学创立之父。,"In that sense Lévi-Strauss is the second great innovator, after Durkheim, of significance to French anthropology, and in my view he should join the triumvirate of Durkheim,Weber, and Marx as a fourth founding father of social science."
5577,翻译理论家，例如乔治·斯泰纳，就提出无论个体是否接受到他人的讯息，个体都必须进行翻译：“所有的交流都是翻译”(Steiner 1975:238）。,"Theorists of translation, such as George Steiner, will argue that individuals must translate whenever they receive others' messages: ""all communication is translation"" (1975: 238)."
5577,此外，合格的翻译要求具有合理的方法保证个体对话者在习语上的一致——这一点从未完全达到，也从不可以论证。,"Furthermore, guaranteed translation requires guaranteed access to the unique idiolect of the individual interlocutor—something which is never achievable and never demonstrable."
5577,因此，编码交换总是模糊和“不确定的”（奎因 Quine）。,"Hence, codificatory exchange is always ambiguous and ""indeterminate"" (Quine)."
5577,没有两个人的经验是完全相同的，它们之间的翻译必定包含创造性的解释。,No two individuals' experience is the same and any translation between them must involve inventive interpretation.
5578,暂时先把乡村牧歌的历史渊源及其在当前的验证问题放在一边，也许首先要说的是在最近几十年，英国的乡村人口开始回升了。,"Leaving aside the question of its origin for an examination of its contemporary provenance, perhaps the first thing to say is that in recent decades, the British rural population has begun to rise again."
5578,和其他工业化国家一样，在正在进行的“反城市化”过程中（在法国成为rurbanisation），特别是大型城市（伦敦、格拉斯哥、伯明翰）及其核心区的人口已经戏剧化地减少了。,"In common with other industrialized countries, there is a process of ‘counter-urbanization’ under way (in France it is called rurbanisation) whereby the population of large cities in particular (London, Glasgow, Birmingham), and their inner cores, has fallen dramatically."
5578,很多人口都迁往了城市周边萌芽中的郊区（cf.Riesman 1958），但至少有一些迁往了居住条件日益改善的更远的乡村地区，尤其是那些仍旧保持“高度宜人的环境”的地方（Cote 1987）。,"Much of this has fed into a burgeoning suburbia on the urban peripheries (cf. Riesman 1958), but some at least has translated into residential growth in more remote rural districts, especially those which remain ‘high amenity environments’ (Cote 1987)."
5579,在弗思那里也存在这种最初的交换，但被非物质化了。是一种“微笑”的交换“以替代任何更易理解或有形的交换”。而他并未交代清楚将要与这些人建立何种物质关系。,"In Firth this opening exchange is present, but dematerialized, an exchange of ""smiles, in lieu of anything more intelligible or tangible at the moment"" and leaving unclear what his material relation to these people is going to be."
5579,与此同时，弗思文中讥讽的注解——他疑惑“如何能劝说这么粗野的人种接受科学研究”——打破了传统图景中平等主义的神话。,"At the same time, Firth demystifies the egalitarianism of the conventional vision with his note of irony about how all this human material ""could be made to submit to scientific study."""
5579,的确，他这里的讥讽隐约表示，他所用的修辞是描述“王者降临”的修辞方式，也是一种征服者语言风格的组成部分。,"Indeed, his irony here lightly marks the royalarrival trope as a trope, and as part of a language of conquest."
5579,这就默认了这样一个事实：他自己的研究项目也是一种权力的宣称。,The fact that his own project is also an assertion of power is tacitly acknowledged.
5579,弗思开头的自我表述说明他要讲述的故事是蒂科皮亚如何变成“他的小岛”，就像马林诺夫斯基后来这样称呼此岛。,"Firth's opening presentation of self suggests the story of Tikopia's becoming ""his little island,"" as Malinowski was later to call it (Firth 1937: 1)."
5580,而且，分类体系及其对立面（结构和所谓的混乱的反结构）可以看作是相伴而生的，构成统一的世界观的不同侧面。,"Furthermore, classificatory systems and their antitheses (structures and their so-called polluting anti-structures) can be viewed as going together, as aspects of the same world-view."
5580,分类的含义不会被无法描述的反常和转换跳跃所破坏与中断，没必要把分类秩序中的仪式或其他间隔当作某种过渡时刻。,"Schemata of classification are not threatened or broken down by indefinable anomalies or transitions, and one need not view ritual or other intervals in classificatory order as somehow transcendental moments."
5580,人们会灵活地将任何意图中的事物按照期望纳入到分类框架中去。因此，反常与含糊最好都被当作是这样一个框架的一部分：人们希望赋予特殊价值的部分——或是尊重、或是不信任、或是戏剧性的、或是漠不关心、抑或是危险与恐惧（Geertz 1983: 80-5）。,"Human ingenuity allows for anything to be made to fit a classificatory schema if this is desired, and thus anomalies and ambiguities should better be seen as special parts of such a schema: parts to which people wish to give a special value—of respect, or distrust, or comedy, or indifference, as well as of danger or fear (cf. Geertz 1983:80–5)."
5580,结构与反结构、秩序与混乱、信任与怀疑、信仰与实践，都是生活中同一形式的组成部分，而不是一种分类，也不是具有威胁性的替代者（Heald 1991）。,"Structure and anti-structure, order and pollution, belief and scepticism, belief and practice, should better be seen as parts of the same form of life, not as a classification and its threatened overcoming (cf. Heald 1991)."
5581,由是，中介活动也常常借用贫困来象征各种现象和关系，尤其是社会关系。,"Liminality, then, often draws on poverty for its repertoire of symbols, particularly for its symbols of social relationship."
5581,同样，我们在日常生活中所见到的那些悠然世外的人，尤其是那些居住在郊区群居村中的人们也喜欢借用贫困所带有的象征含义来表达自己的观念。最近一段时间，还有一种社会现象引起了人类学家和历史学家的浓厚兴趣，它和我们上面所说的各种颂扬乞讨的修道会以及现今的反文化运动组织有许多相似之处。,"Similarly, as we have seen, the voluntary outsiders of our own society, particularly today's voluntary rural communards, also draw upon the symbolic vocabulary of poverty and indigence.Both the mendicant orders and today's counterculture have affinities with another social phenomenon which has recently aroused great interest among anthropologists and historians."
5582,政治上，威超从未认为种族差异意味着行为差异，也从未支持过种族歧视行径。,"Politically Virchow never argued that race differences implied differentials in behavior, and he never pledged support for racist practices."
5582,当然，这又提出了解释的问题，对德国体质人类学史抱有一种目的论，或者说强烈的相对主义观点的支持者也许不禁想说，从布鲁门巴赫到威超，德语区知识分子已经想方设法为大屠杀作准备了。,"Of course, this raises questions of interpretation.Proponents of a teleological, or strong relativist, argument on the history of physical anthropology in Germany might be tempted to contend that from Blumenbach to Virchow German scholars in one way or the other already were preparing the Holocaust."
5582,但是，如果这一观点的前提受到质疑，那么就需要将威超视为一个矛盾的人物而不是把他当作其所属文化的一个工具来进行评价。,"If the very premises of such an argument are met with some skepticism, however, then Virchow has to be assessed as a contradictory figure rather than as a tool of his culture."
5582,根据后面一种视角，当威超从其学校统计中挑选出犹太人的数据以及当他任凭别人打着他的名号进行这方面的辩论和研究的时候，他显然已经屈服于在德国崛起的反犹太主义和种族主义情绪了。,"According to the latter perspective, Virchow certainly gave in to the rising mood of anti-Semitism and racism in Germany when he singled out data on Jews from his Schulstatistik, for instance, and when he gave the authority of his name to debates and research by others in such directions."
5582,从长期情况来看，这些争论和研究计划帮助种族主义在德国取得了全新的学术合法性。,"In the long run, these debates and projects helped to give racism in Germany a completely new, academic legitimacy."
5582,它们确立了一种既成的认可，正是在此基础之上，20世纪上半叶的德国种族主义才能够带着越来越残忍的野心构建起自己的种种阴谋计划。,"They created an established acceptance on which the German racism of the first half of the twentieth century could then build with its own schemes and projects, and with increasingly murderous ambition."
5583,到目前为止描述的赠送、接受和分享形成社会保障或保险的一种形式。,"Giving, receiving, and sharing as so far described constitute a form of social security or insurance."
5583,一个家庭有财力时就为他人奉献，因而可以指望在需要时得到他人的回报。,A family contributes to others when they have the means and can count on receiving from others in time of need.
5583,调整机制在泛化互惠或平衡互惠过程中起作用，促使财富在长时期内平等分配。,"A leveling mechanism is at work in the process of generalized or balanced rec¬iprocity, promoting an egalitarian distribution of wealth over the long run."
5583,消极互惠（negative reciprocity）是交换的第三种形式。在消极互惠中赠与人试图在交易中胜出。,"Negative reciprocity is a third form of reciprocity exchange, in which the giver tries to get the better end of the deal."
5583,交易双方有着对立的利益，通常是不同社区的成员，而且关系不太密切。消极互惠的极端形式是用暴力把东西抢走。,"The parties involved have opposing interests, usually are members of different communities, and are not closely related."
5584,在某种程度上，答案需要通过力量的显现得以揭晓。,"In part, the answer is through manifestations of power."
5584,如果一个人持有对于泛生信仰或超自然存在之力量的信念，那么他就很容易看到那些似乎是运用这些超自然力量所产生的结果。例如，如果一个美拉尼西亚的武士因为相信自己拥有必要的“马那”而对自己的力量充满信心，并且他获胜了，他就很可能将此胜利视为是“马那”之力的证明。,"This means, given a belief in animatism and/or the powers of supernatural beings, one is predisposed to see what appear to be results of the application of such powers.For example, if a Melanesian warrior is convinced of his power because he possesses the necessary mana and he is successful, he is likely to interpret this success as proof of the power of mana."
5584,“不管怎么说，如果我没有马那’，我就会失败不是吗？”,"After all, I would have lost had I not possessed it, wouldn't I?"
5584,,"Beyond this, because of his confidence in his mana he may be willing to take more chances in his fighting, and this indeed could mean the difference between success or failure."
5585,种族身份和种族组织之间明显的二元论——“个人的实现”对抗于“对我来说它其中有什么”——是可以被克服的，或者通过简单地承认它们是同一硬币的两边，或者将族群性概念化为某种类似于整体的社会现象的东西。,"The apparent dualism between ethnic identity and ethnic organisation – personal fulfilment versus ""What's in it for me?"" – can be overcome, either by simply conceding that they are two sides of the same coin, or by conceptualising ethnicity as something akin to a total social phenomenon."
5585,借鉴了韦纳（Weiner）关于不可剥夺的财产的概念（参见第十二章），西蒙·哈里森（Simon Harrison 2000）采取了后一种做法。,"Drawing on Weiner's concept of inalienable possessions (see Chapter 12), Simon Harrison (2000) does the latter."
5585,他将种族身份的符号和标志物作为自我人格的核心元素加以讨论，而自我是不能被交换或交易的。,"He discusses the symbols and markers of ethnic identity as core elements of selfhood, which cannot be bartered or traded.When one group tries to appropriate another's symbols, through ""piracy"" or commercialisation (e.g."
5585,当一个群体试图盗用其他群体的符号时，通过“侵权”或商品化（例如，在原始艺术的个案中），或是社会流动的过程中（例如，使一切梵语化的例子，参见第十章），最初的群体会试图保护它的种族不动产，它们由符号、知识和塑造他们的身份的人工制品组成。,"in the case of Aboriginal art), or in processes of social mobility (e.g.in Sanskritisation, cf.Chapter 10), the original group will try to protect its ethnic estate, which consists of the symbols, knowledge and artifacts that make them who they are."
5585,在这样的情况下，身份和政治就合并在一起了。,"In such situations, identity and politics merge."
5586,在前面讨论语言变化时，我们指出群体间的语音和词汇差异是促使语言变化的要力量。,"In our previous discussion of linguistic change, phonological and vocabulary differences among groups were noted as important forces for linguistic change."
5586,具有足以相互理解的相似性的一种语言变异形式，叫作方言（dialects）。方言研究是社会语言学（sociolinguistics）研究的一个方面。,"Varying forms of a language similar enough to be mutually intelligible are known as dialects, and the study of dialects is a concern of sociolinguistics."
5586,从技术方面看，所嵙的方言都是语言——在语言方面，没有什么分语言或次语言这种东西—— 而且两种不同方言成为不同语言的关键点，人致在于说一种方言的人几乎不能与说其他方言的人交流这一点。,"Technically, all dialects are languages—they have nothing partial or sublinguistic about them一and at the point two dialects become distinctly different languages is roughly where speakers of one are almost totally unable to communicate with speakers of the other."
5586,分界线可能在心理、地理、社会或经济的方面，而这些方面往往不是很清楚。,"Boundaries may be psychological, geographic, social, or economic, and they are not always very clear."
5586,就地区方言来说，经常有过渡地带，或可能是缓冲地带，就如在中国的中部与南部之间的地带，在那里可以找到并理解两种方言的各种特 点。,"Regional dialects frequently have a transitional territory, or perhaps a buffer zone, where features of both are found and understood, as between central and southern China."
5587,放牧者，在农业革命之后出现，而不是许多人所假定的在此之 前。,"Pastoralists emerged after the agricultural revolution and not before it, as is often assumed."
5587,他们总是，或几乎总是，与定居的农业种植者之间存在着某种交换产品的共生关系。,"They always, or nearly always, live in some kind of symbiotic relationship with settled agriculturalists with whom they exchange products."
5587,他们的劳动分工通常以性别和年龄为基础，而社会组织可能与狩猎采集者的一样简单，这与他们的经济体系对他们提出的机动性和灵活性的要求相关。,"The division of labour is usually based on gender and age, and the social organisation may be as simple as that of hunters and gatherers, a fact connected with the need for mobility and flexibility required by their economic system."
5587,生产科技是灵活机动的，而他们主要的经济资源由动物组成（对照来看，农业种植者将他们的主要资源看成是土地，而狩猎采集者和许多园艺栽培者将劳动力视为他们最重要的经济资源），通常都是个体拥有对动物的所有权。,"The technology of production is flexible and mobile, and the main economic resource comprises animals (in contrast to agriculturalists, who see their chief resource as land, and to hunters and gatherers, as well as many horticulturalists, who see labour as their most important economic resource).Ownership of animals is frequently individual."
5588,照理说，应当给予这样的民族寻找幸福的机会，同时又不使其所生存的国家出现分裂或解体。,Such nations should be given a chance to find their own good without causing the fragmentation or the break-up of the states they inhabit.
5588,然而，这种安排存在着明显的缺陷。,There is an evident danger in such arrangements.
5588,首先，放权或勉强凑合的国际地位，如果发展得过分，可能会产生“国中之国”，这便潜藏了矛盾和缺陷。,"First, devolution and an international status of sorts can, when pushed to extremes, lead to the creation of a ""state within a state"", with the potential discord and weakness that it implies."
5589,这样，威利斯就把民族志作者的适当角色定义为助产士。,"Thus, Willis defines the appropriate function of the ethnographer as midwife."
5589,那些小伙子体现出了一些批判性的洞见，但这些洞见是以一种带有立场的（engaged〕、扭曲的方式体现的，而民族志作者能将其记录下来。,"The lads embody the critical insights, but in an engaged, stunted way, which the ethnographer can register."
5589,因此，民族志作者应该做的就是显示并阐明这些洞见，并解释为何它们会导致非预期的结果和无行动（inaction）。,"Thus, it is for the ethnographer to bring out and clarify the insights as well as to explain why they may lead to unintended consequences or inaction."
5589,如威利斯所说，正是工人阶级表面上的文化提升导致了他们自身的恶劣现状”(第122页）。,"As Willis says, ""It is the apparent cultural ascension of the working class which brings the hell of its own real present"" (122)."
5590,虽然在没有货帀的情况下，市场交换可以借助于物物交换和其他互惠形式进行，但是至少对特殊的交易而言，某种形式的货币使市场交换更加有效。,"Although market exchanges may occur without money through bartering and other forms of reciprocity, some form of money at least for special transactions makes market exchange more efficient."
5590,在市场经济中，当很少有机会进入正式经济的大量不充分就业和失业人员试图生存下去时，非正式部门可能比正式部门更为重要。,"In market economies, the informal sector may become more important than the formal sector as large numbers of under- and unemployed people with marginal access to the formal economy seek to survive."
5590,非正式经济是那呰逃避官方详细检查和控制的经济活动。,The informal economy consists of economic activities that escape official scrutiny and regulation.
5590,在当代国际开发和国际贸易中，对经济的人类学研究方式已获得新的重要地位。,The anthropological approach to economics has taken on new importance in today's world of international development and commerce.
5591,在分层社会中，流动程度与占支配地位类型的家庭组织有关。,The degree of mobility in a stratified society is related to the prevailing kind of family organization.
5591,在扩大家庭最常见的社会中，流动通常是困难的，因为每个个体都牢牢依附于大家庭群体。,"In societies where the extended family is the usual form, mobility is apt to be difficult, because each individual is strongly tied to the large family group."
5591,因此，如果一个人想要上升到更高的社会阶级，他或她的家庭也必须同时向上流动。,"Hence, for a person to move up to a higher social class, his or her family must move up as well."
5591,流动对于独立的核心家庭来说要容易一些，因为在这种家庭中，个体只与少数人紧密相连。,Mobility is easier for independent nuclear families where the individual is closely tied to fewer persons.
5591,此外，在新居制下，个体在正常情况下会离幵他们出生之家。,"Moreover, under neolocal residence, individuals normally leave the family they were born into."
5591,所以，通过谨慎选择的婚姻、事业上的成功以及通过脱离他们曾经在其中成的下层阶级的家庭一一 它们是通过居住地的流动成为可能的——个人能更容易在社会中“向上流动”。,"So it is, then, that through careful marriage, occupational success, and disassociating themselves from the lower-class family they grew up in, all of which are made possible by residential mobility, individuals can more easily ""move up"" in society."
5592,组织和考虑亲属制度有很多种社会方式。尽管“西方”社会的一个广泛流传的文化观念是亲属制度涉及生物学和血缘纽带（Schneider 1984），人类学的研究一般将它当成人们的文化分类和群体形成的方方面面进行分析。,"There are many social ways of organising, and thinking about, kinship.Although it is a widespread cultural notion in ""Western"" societies that kinship is related to biology and blood ties (Schneider 1984), anthropological research generally analyses it as cultural classifications of people and as aspects of group formation."
5592,本章介绍了亲属制度的某些核心特征，在这里它被当成社会组织，并讨论了计算家族的不同方式。,"This chapter introduces some central features of kinship seen as social organisation, and discusses different ways of reckoning kin."
5592,在下一章，我们的关注点是婚姻系统和亲属制度的象征方面。,"In the next chapter, the focus is on marriage systems and symbolic aspects of kinship."
5593,最常见的问题源于对有权自决群体的不确定性，这种问题与分离有关。,The most common problem arising from the uncertainty about the units entitled to self-determination concerns secession.
5593,在很长的一段时间里，民族自决原则获得支持的背景都是形式上的帝国尤其是欧洲海外帝国的分裂。,"For a long time, the principle of national self-determination was advocated in the context of the break-up of formal empires, especially the European overseas empires."
5593,但它绝不应该仅限于此。,But there is no reason why it should stop there.
5593,民族自决的原则同样也得到一个国家的各个全国性群体（national groups）的拥护。,The principle of self-determination can also be espoused by national groups within a state.
5594,教仪式是活动中的宗教。,
5594,通过宗教行动，社会纽带得到强化生命中的危机时刻是举行仪式的恰当时机。,
5594,阿诺尔德˙范˙根纳普杷这种生命礼仪分为分离、过渡和融入三个阶段。,"Arnold Van Gennep divided such rites of passage into rites of separation, transition, and incorporation."
5594,强化仪式是标志群体生活而非个体生活危机时刻的仪式。,Rites of intensification are rituals to mark crisis occasions in the life of the group rather than the individual.
5594,它们能够把人们团结起来，减少对危机的恐惧，并促发集体行动。,"They serve to unite people, allay fear of the crisis, and prompt collective action."
5594,葬礼上的各种仪式是人们失去亲人或朋友之后，为人们重新进行社会调适而提供的强化仪式。,Funerary ceremonies are rites of intensification that provide for social readjustment after the loss of the deceased.
5594,强化仪式还可能包括寻求吉利条件的一年一度的庆典——在诸如播种和收获等重要活动前后举行。,Rites of intensification also may involve annual ceremonies to seek favorable conditions surrounding critical activities such as planting and harvesting.
5595,解决这类问题的办法也许对魁北克的未来和其他为分离主义恶魔所困扰的国家有参考价值。,"An approach of this kind could have relevance for the future of Quebec, and of other countries troubled by the spectre of separatism."
5595,这种办法有效地调和了联盟与独立之间的矛盾，能为既要求分离而又不想断绝所有联系的民族提供出路。,
5595,照理说，应当给予这样的民族寻找幸福的机会，同时又不使其所生存的国家出现分裂或解体。,
5595,问题：翻译不够准确贴切改1：解决这类问题的办法也许对魁北克的未来和其他为分离主义所困扰的国家有参考价值。,
5595,这种象征性有效的办法有效地调和了联盟与独立之间的矛盾，能为既要求分离而又不想断绝所有联系的民族提供出路。,"Symbolically potent solutions, conciliating union and independence, could offer a way out for nations that press for separation but do not want to break all links."
5595,照理说，应当给予这样的民族寻找幸福的机会，同时又不使其所生存的国家出现分裂或解体。,Such nations should be given a chance to find their own good without causing the fragmentation or the break-up of the states they inhabit.
5596,规定政治组织的部落亲属联系的另一形式是分支世系群制度（segmentary linage system）。,Another form of tribal kinship bond that provides political organization is the segmentary lineage system.
5596,这一系统在运行方面与氐族相似，但它较少扩展旦较罕见。,"This system is similar in operation to the clan, but it is less extensive and is relatively rare."
5596,最著名的例子是东非的一些社会，诸如索马里人和苏丹的丁卡人或努尔人，他们是散布在广阔地域、有高度流动性的草原游牧民族。,The best known examples are East African societies such as the Somali and the Dinka or Nuer of the Sudan: pastoral nomads who are highly mobile and widely scattered over large territories.
5596,与其他的东非牧民（比如马阿赛人)不同，它们缺少逾越继嗣群体成员身份的年龄等级组织。,"Unlike other East African pastoralists (the Maasai, for example), they lack the age grading organization that cuts across descent group membership."
5597,他们将布须曼人视为本土古老的环境知识、捕猎技术、亲属关系实践、宗教信仰等等的继承人。,"They see Bushmen as the inheritors of ancient indigenous environmental knowledge, hunting techniques, kin- ship practices, religious beliefs, and so on."
5597,威尔姆森等修正主义者不再强调这些方面，而更为关注南非政治经济结构作为一个整体的整合。,Revisionists like Wilmsen de-emphasize these aspects in favour of greater concern with the integration of Southern African politico-economic structures taken as a whole.
5597,具有讽刺意味的是，这两种观点都宣称其知识源自马克思，双方也都 认为自己的研究途径是能够解释社会过程的。,"The irony is that both sides claim intellectual descent from Marx, and both sides see their approach as one which explains social processes."
5598,如果一个男子与其已故妻子的姐妹结婚，就被称为妻姐妹婚。从本质上说，“嫁妻”的家庭给“娶妻”的家庭提供了另一个配偶来代替死者的位置。,"When a man marries the sister of his dead wife, it is called the sororate; in essence, a family of ""wife givers"" supplies one of ""wife takers"" with another spouse to take the place of the one who died."
5598,在存在夫兄弟婚与妻姐妹婚的社会中，两个家庭的关系即使在一方配偶死后仍可保持下去；而且在这种社会中，亲属制度结构（在第十章讨论）一般保证提供适当的兄弟和姐妹，因而北美人称之为“堂表亲”的个人归在兄弟和姐妹之列。,"In societies that have the levirate and sororate, the relationship between the two families thus is maintained even after a spouse's death; and in such societies, an adequate supply of brothers and sisters is generally ensured by the structure of the kinship system (discussed in Chapter 10), whereby individuals North Americans would call ""cousins"" are classified as brothers and sisters."
5599,漂流者在当地的社会经济组织中占据了一个位置，这也是他们赖以生存的方式——如果他们的确能生存下去的话，这么说是因为当囚徒比作田野工作要冒更大的风险。,"Castaways take up a place within the indigenous social and economic organization; that is how they survive—if, indeed, they do survive, for captivity is a rather higher-risk business than fieldwork."
5599,人类学家通常与当地人建立一种基于西方商品的交换关系。,Anthropologists customarily establish a relationship of exchange with the group based on Western commodities.
5599,这是他们赖以生存的方式，他们也是通过这种方式试图与被访人保持非剥削性的关系。,That is how they survive and try to make their relations with informants nonexploitive.
5599,但这一策略无疑非常自相矛盾，因为它使人类学家总是成为（被他们自己视为）解构研究对象的推动者。,"But of course this strategy is enormously contradictory, for it makes anthropologists constant contributors to what they themselves see as the destruction of their object of study."
5599,相反，漂流者和俘虏的身份是清白的，处于矛盾之中的民族志作者羡慕这种身份，原因就在于此（尽管真的像俘虏那样成为土著人，对人类学家来说是禁忌）。,"The status of the captive or castaway, by contrast, is innocent, and one can see why it would be a compelling image to the contradiction-ridden ethnographer (though actually going native, as captives often did, is taboo for anthropologists)."
5600,符号分析类似于结构主义，个案研究则类似于功能主义。,Symbolic analysis is to configurationalism as the case study is to functionalism.
5600,与结构主义一样，符号分析也是竭力想要揭示一种文化的逻辑意义模式。,"Like configurationalism, symbolic analysis endeavors to reveal the logicomeaningful patterning of a culture."
5600,格尔茨研究巴厘人的目的，有着与本尼迪克特对平原印第安人和普布罗印地安人进行对比相同的目的。,Geertz's aim with respect to the Balinese is like Benedict's vis-à-vis the Plains and Pueblo Indians.
5600,虽然格尔茨关注的只是一 具体形式斗鸡的细节，并通过那一部分来呈现整体，但却从中获取了精确度。,"Geertz gains precision, though, by focusing in detail on a specificform – acockfight – and representing the whole through that part."
5601,在此意义上，它们等同于人类的辅助语言。,"In this sense, they are equivalent to human paralanguage."
5601,它们的大部分交流是通过特别的手势或姿势进行的。,Much of their communication occurs by kinesics—specific gestures and postures.
5601,确实，其中有些动作，如做鬼脸、亲吻、拥抱，实际上在今天的人类和类人猿中也普遍使用。,"Indeed, some of these, such as grimacing, kissing, and embracing, are in virtually universal use today among humans as well as apes."
5601,认识到手势交流对类人猿的重要性，心理学家艾伦和比阿特丽斯·加德纳开始教年幼的黑猩猩瓦休使用聋哑人用的北美式手势语，它是自那时起学会用手势示意的第一个黑猩猩。,"Recognizing the importance of gestural communication to apes, psychologists Allen and Beatrice Gardner began teaching the American Sign Language, used by the deaf, to their young chimpanzee Washoe, the first of several who have since learned to sign."
5601,（参见第三章的“原著学习”）黑猩猩掌握超过400个手势语词汇，就已证实它们自己能够把每一个手势从其原来所指物体迁移到其他相应的物体，甚至物体图像。,"(See the Original Study in Chapter 3.)With vocabularies of more than 400 signs, chimps have shown they can transfer each sign from its original referent to other appropriate objects and even pictures of objects."
5602,在一个更加具体的记录中，爱德瓦·怀丁（Edvard Hviding 1994）展示了家族的概念和实践都具有强烈的女系倾向的所罗门岛民，在最近一些年里如何开始强调父方家系的血统，父系血统被证明在形成社团和对土地权利的主张方面是更有效率的。,"On a more specific note, Edvard Hviding (1994) shows how Solomon islanders, whose kinship concepts and practices have strong cognatic leanings, have in recent years begun to emphasise patrilineal descent, which proves more efficient in the formation of corporations and the making of land claims."
5602,这个现象是否应该被贴上“现代性的本地化”或“本地性的现代化”的标签，是一个开放式的问题，但有一点很清楚，亲属制度的实践和观念的转变与社会文化的变化有关，也与文化是一种政治资源的想法蔓延有关。,"Whether this should be labelled ""indigenisation of modernity"" or ""modernisation of indigenity"" is an open question, but it is clear that the shift in kinship practices and concepts is related to sociocultural change and the spread of the idea of culture as a political resource."
5602,巴黎是世界上最重要的“非洲人的”城市之一，它吸引了数以千计的来自非洲的讲法语地区的音乐人、学生、劳工移民和难民。,"Paris is one of the most important ""African"" cities in the world, and it attracts thousands of musicians, students, labour migrants and refugees from the Francophone parts of Africa."
5603,造成这种情况的原因之一是，在公共政策方面有一个错误的、然而却是牢固的假设。人们在如此多由妇女当家的家户中看到的贫困，是由这类家户所谓的偏常性质引起的。,One reason for this is a flawed assumption that is nonetheless entrenched in public policy: that the poverty seen in so many female-headed households is caused by the supposedly deviant nature of such households.
5603,据称这种偏常的部分原因是，妇女想要外出找工作赚钱，而不是去找丈夫供养她们以便她们能够待在家里抚养孩子（人们“认为”妇女应该这样)。,"This deviation is allegedly caused in part by women wanting to go outside the home to earn money instead of finding husbands to support them so that they can stay home and bring up the children, as women are ""supposed"" to do."
5603,事实上，在整个美国历史上，妇女都一直是劳动力中的一分子，而只有少部分妇女才有条件成为“正常的”、不做作的“淑女”。,"In fact, women have participated in the labor force throughout United Stares history, whereas only a limited proportion of the population ever possessed the resources to support ""proper"" non- working ""ladies""."
5604,这本书是一个编织成的叙事，它经常游移在三种意味深长的记录之间，尽管这种游移偶尔显得笨拙。,"A braided narrative, the book moves constantly, at times awkwardly, between its three meaningful registers."
5604,《尼萨》和许多作品一样，描绘了普通入的经历、冲突、欢乐、艰辛等等。,"Nisa is like many works that portray common human experiences, conflicts, joys, work, and so on."
5604,但肖斯塔克制作的文本是原创的，因为她拒绝将三种记录调合成一个无懈可击的、“全面”的表述，它们在戏剧性的张力中保持独立。,"But the text Shostak has made is original in the way it refuses to blend its three registers into a seamless, ""full"" representation.They remain separate, in dramatic tension."
5604,这种复调适合于这本书面临的困境，即许多具有自觉意识的民族志作者发现很难从一个面定的、客观的立场来谈论定义明确的“他者”。,"This polyvocality is appropriate to the book's predicament, that of many self-conscious ethnographic writers who find it difficult to speak of well-defined ""others"" from a stable, distanced position."
5604,差异干扰了文本；它再不能被表述；它必须被制定（enact)。,Difference invades the text; it can no longer be represented; it must be enacted.
5605,较罕见的是，一种运动会激起长期潜伏在文化底层的调适力量，因而长期延续的宗教就可能诞生。,"More rarely, a movement may tap long dormant adaptive forces underlying a culture, and an enduring religion may result."
5605,摩门教就是这样。,Such is the case with Mormonism.
5605,尽管刚开始时遭到严重迫害，到处受追捕，但摩门教徒最终能够调适到这样的程度以致他们的宗教在今天的美国兴旺发达。,"Though heavily persecuted at first and hounded from place to place, Mormons adapted to the point that their religion thrives in the United States today."
5605,的确，复兴运动扎根于所有已知的宗教:犹太教、基督教，还包括伊斯兰教。,"Indeed, revitalization movements lie at the root of all known religions, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam included."
5605,我们将会在第十五章继续讨论复兴运动。,We shall return to revitalization movements in Chapter 15.
5606,复杂结构主要存在于欧洲、日本和非洲大部分地区，这些地方没有“基本” 形式。人们可以自由地与任何一个人结婚，只要不是近亲。,"Complex structures comprise those systems of Europe, Japan, most of Africa, and so on, where no such ‘elementary’ patterns are to be found: one marries anyone, provided he or she is not a close relative."
5606,但北美土著和西非的一些社会，因为有一系列繁多的禁止婚姻的规则，所以从个人而不是从血统的观点看，与一般性的交换相似。,"However, some societies, especially in Native North America and West Africa, have such an extensive array of negative marriage rules that their systems, from an individual though not a lineage point of view, come to resemble those of generalized exchange."
5607,这些进化的类形学和定律所假设的关系，建立在功能主义或因果分析的基础之上，因此A与B共变，因为A在功能上或因果上与B有关——农业与国家相伴随，因为它为后者设置了必要条件，没有它国家就不可能正常运转。,"The relationships postulated by these evolutionary typologies and laws are based on a functionalist or causal kind of analysis, such that A covaries with B because A is functionally or causally related to B: Agriculture is found with states because it sets necessary conditions, without which the state could not function."
5607,处在中心边缘的情况，为文化前进准备了条件，使得边缘逐步发展成中心。,The condition of being at the periphery sets the stage for cultural advances that then catapult periphery into center.
5607,这种因果一功能概化的启发来源，是自然科学中的实证主义模型。,The inspiration for this kind of causal-functional generalization is the positivistic model of natural sciences.
5608,就刚才引述的这个例子而言，由于人类学坚守文化相对主义的立场，使得我们能理解门徳人女性成年礼割除阴蒂的这一做法。,"In the case just cited, the anthropological commitment to cultural relativism permits an understanding of the practice of clitoridectomy (removal of the clitoris) in the Mende female initiation rites."
5608,但正如在本书前面部分（参见第二章）讨论过的那样，文化相对主义并不排除人类学家对一种既定习俗提出批评。,"But as discussed earlier in this book (see Chapter 2), cultural relativism does not preclude the anthropologist from criticizing a given practice."
5608,在这个案例中，割除阴蒂(如同切除包皮一样)是一种生殖器伤残形式，而且是特别危险的那种形式。,"In this case, removal of the clitoris (like male circumcision) is a form of genital mutilation, and a particularly dangerous one at that."
5608,某些形式的生殖器伤残——从割除阴蒂到切除整个女性外阴，包括封闭部分的阴道口（在需要性交时就用外科手术打开，或者甚至撕开，生完孩子后重新封闭，直到男性再次有性交欲望才打开)——今天仍影响着世界上大约8000万的妇女，而在非洲尤其普遍，在28个国家中时有发生(每年至少有200万少 女面临这种危险）。,"Some form of genital mutilation, ranging from the removal of the clitoris to the removal of the entire external female genitalia, including the partial closing of the vaginal opening (surgically opened for intercourse and closed again after a birth until the male again desires intercourse), affects an estimated 80 million women in the world today and is particularly widespread in Africa, where it occurs in 28 countries."
5609,认知相对论是一派胡言，道德相对论是个悲剧。,"Cognitive relativism is nonsense, moral relativism is tragic."
5609,如果忽视或否认人类环境因科学革命发生的整体转变，你就无法理解它……有效的知识忽视而不开拓未知领域。,You cannot understand the human condition if you ignore or deny its total transformation by the success of the scientific revolution… Valid knowledge ignores and does not engender frontiers.
5609,人们根本无法理解我们共享的社会环境，除非我们从以下无可争议的事实出发，即关于自然的真正知识是可能的，并旦已经发生了，这知识完全改变了人类社会运作的范围。,"One simply cannot understand our shared social condition unless one starts from the indisputable fact that genuine knowledge of nature is possible and has occurred, and has totally transformed the terms of reference in which human societies operate."
5610,当然，霍布斯不是个体主义的单一来源，而仅仅是一个值得注意的表达得非常清楚和有说服力的代表。,"Hobbes is not, of course, the sole source of individualism, merely a notably lucid and forceful representative."
5610,许多影响聚合到一起教给我们个体主义。,Many influences converge to teach us individualism.
5610,例如，西方语言强调人称代词“我”——这一重点强调在其他语言中并不常出现。,"Western languages, for example, emphasize the personal pronoun ""I""–an emphasis not always present in other languages."
5610,新教传统强调，是个体自身，作为一个独立单位，遭受天谴被罚人地狱永远受苦，或是得到拯救升入天堂享受极乐。,"Protestant Christian tradition emphasizes that it is the individual self, as an independent unit, which is damned to eternal suffering in hell or saved for eternal bliss in heaven."
5611,文化模式的存在和行为通过一些事件清楚明晰地表现出来，因此我运用这一理论框架最根本的目的是，为了将那些 表明文化模式存在，并且产生行为的事件同那些由贝克特一亨利之间的冲突来主导的，且前后相继的事件区分开来。,
5611,文化模式不但与角色之间业已存在，并且不断发展的社会关系的当前状态有关，而且还同文化目标、手段、观念、未来的期望、思想潮流、信仰模式等方面有关。文化模式进入到这些关系之中，对其加以阐释并且施加影响，或促使其联合或使其分裂。,"These have reference not only to the current state of social relationships existing or developing between actors, but also to the cultural goals, means, ideas, outlooks, currents of thought, patterns of belief, and so on, which enter into those relationships, interpret them, and incline them to alliance or divisiveness."
5611,这些根范式不是一些具有单一概念的体系，并且也没有逻辑关系，它们不是用于思考的精准工具，并且也不是模式化的指导原则，它们无法用来指导伦理的、审美的或者传统的行为。,"These root paradigms are not systems of univocal concepts, logically arrayed; they are not, so to speak, precision tools of thought.Nor are they stereotyped guidelines for ethical, esthetic, or conventional action."
5612,威利斯关于学校背景下的工人阶级青少年的研究属于第二种模式，即策略性选点的民族志，我们将在下一部分讨论这一研究。,"In his study of working class youth in a school setting, Willis writes in the second mode of strategically situated ethnography, discussed in the next section."
5612,这里要提出的很有意思的一点是，威利斯和其他明确地在马克思主义理论传统中写作的民族志作者[例如《南美洲的魔鬼与商品拜物教》(Taussing 1980）的作者迈克尔˙陶西格]在这方面具有很强的优势，既将更广阔的秩序作为背景，同时又聚焦于一个作为民族志对象的、经详尽考察过的地点。,"Here it is interesting to note that Willis and other ethnographers who write explicitly within the Marxist theoretical tradition (e.g., Michael Taussig in The Devil and Commodity Fetishism in South America) have the powerful advantage of placing the larger order in the background while focusing intensely upon a closely observed locale as ethnographic subject."
5612,因为读者一方被假定为熟悉或至少是了解马克思主义体系的。因此只需要将定点民族志指向或指涉马克思主义理论的论题，也就基本完成了对更广阔秩序的再现工作。,"Because familiarity, or at least acquaintance, with the Marxist framework can be assumed on the part of the reader, much of the work of inventing a representation of the larger order is accomplished merely by orienting or referring the situated ethnography to issues of Marxist theory."
5613,约一万年前，一些人从狩猎和采集生活进入农业生活。,"By some 10,000 years ago, some humans had moved from hunting and gathering to agriculture."
5613,农业生活允许人口集中和永久定居。,Agriculture permitted concentrated population and permanent settlement.
5613,定居刺激了城市发展。,Settlement stimulated the development of cities.
5613,城市刺激了识字和技术的发展，后者则激励进一步的文化进化。,"Cities stimulated the development of literacy and technology, which spurred further cultural evolution."
5613,最终人类社会进入工业革命、现代化和后工业化、信息时代。,"Eventually came the industrial revolution, modernity, and the postindustrial, information age."
5614,因此，妇女便构成了世界上大多数社会中贫困、被剥夺基本权利的、经济社会地位低的群体的主要部分，在美国这正在变成事实。,"Thus, women constitute the majority of the poor, the underprivileged, and the economically and socially disadvantaged in most of the world's societies, just as is becoming true in the United States."
5614,在“不发达”国家，这种情形由 国际货币基金组织要求重新商谈外债偿付的“改革”而变得更糟。,"In underdeveloped countries, the situation has been made worse by areformsn the International Monetary Fund (IMF) requires to renegotiate payment of foreign debts."
5614,政府为偿付债务而对教育、健康和社会计划的开支削减对妇女和儿童产生了直接的（负面）影响， 而为了增加外汇（为了换取债务偿还款和为进一步工业化提供资金）所规划的进一步发展，也是以牺牲妇女和儿童的利益为代价达到的。,"Cutbacks in government education, health, and social programs for debt service have their most direct (and negative) impact on women and children, while further development designed to increase foreign exchange (for debt repayment and the financing of more industrialization) also comes at women and children's expense."
5615,“升级”这一概念也可用于这一阶段：比如在一个复杂的工业社会中，反对者可能会推动一项争议越过中间的程序从初级法庭的司法裁决直接上诉至最高法院。,"The notion of ""escalation"" can apply to this phase also: in a complex, industrial society, for example, antagonists might move a dispute up from a court of lower jurisdiction to the supreme court through intervening judicial stages."
5615,在冰岛的恩加尔（Njal)传奇故事中，组成这一传奇故事的那一类戏剧都呈现出逐步升级的特点。,"In the Icelandic Njal's Saga, escalation characterizes the set of dramas that make up the saga."
5615,对地方秩序的违犯往往作为故事的开端，接着出现了小的危机，然后是非正式的矫正。最初的时候，这一系列事件主要发生在10世纪时期冰岛南部地区一个由很多家庭式的社区组成的小地方。尽管一些家庭在这一地方的定居很短暂并且对于土地的争端也在不断进行调整，但是这一地区还是日益扩大了。终于，一次公共性的违犯引发了主要的悲剧性的一幕：一名深受众人拥护爱戴的宗教头领无端被他的义兄弟杀害了，此人是恩加尔的众多儿子中最刚愎自用的一个。,"It begins with simple breaches of local order, minor crisis, and informal redress, mainly at the level of household communities in a small region of the South Quarter of tenth-century Iceland, which cumulate, despite temporary settlement and adjustment of claims, until, finally, a public breach that triggers the tragic main drama takes place: a godi, or priest chieftain, who is also a good man, is killed wantonly by his foster brother, the most intransigent ofNjals sons."
5616,卡伯里（Kaberry 1957: 81-2)更为概括地描述了马林诺夫斯基功能理论抽象概念的三个层次。,"In more general terms, Kaberry (1957: 81–2) describes three levels of abstraction in Malinowski’s theory of function."
5616,"第一个层次,“功能”表示一种制度对另一种制度的影响，就是说，是社会制度之间的关系。","At the first, ‘function’ denotes the effects of an institution on other institutions, that is, the relation between social institutions."
5616,这个层次类似于拉德克利夫-布朗著作中所说的制度。,This level is similar to that in Radcliffe-Brown’s work.
5616,,The second involves the understanding of an institution in terms defined by members of the community.
5617,不论有多么相似，民族志总是比描述所能包括的要多出很多。,"Whatever the approach, ethnography is always more than description."
5617,民族志也是一种概化的方式。,Ethnography is also a way of generalizing.
5617,不过，这一方式与标准的科学模型不同，在某些方面离艺术较近。,"This way differs from the standard scientific model, however, and in some ways is closer to the arts."
5617,科学模型基于一些可以一直追溯到亚里士多德的原理。,The scientific model is based on principles some would trace to Aristotle.
5617,实证主义科学通过归纳研究许多事例，确定一个原理或对所有事物/人都具有共性的趋向，或是追踪共变。,"Inductively surveying many instances, positivist science ascertains a principle or trend common to all, or traces covariation."
5617,因此，共性和共变可被陈述为与类形学、定理或统计相关。,"Commonality and covariation can then be stated as typologies, laws, or statistical correlations."
5618,其 中，克里斯多佛• 霍尔派克 ( Christoph er Hallpike )  的论述与列维－布留尔完全一致 。,One who does write in the same vein is Christopher Hallpike.
5618,他提出 （ 例如 Hallpiked 1979 : 50 - 51 ) 如果列维－布留尔能注意到认知心理学的可能性，他的著作会更有价 值。,"He has argued (e.g., 1979: 50-1) that Levy-Bruhl’s work would have been yet more valuable had Le ́vy-Bruhl been aware of the possibilities of cognitive psychology."
5618,霍尔派克自已将“原始思维”与儿童正确认知世界的思维过 程相联系。,Hallpike himself has likened ‘primitive thought’ to the thought processes of children constructing a correct understanding of the world.
5618,他的理论基础来自瑞士心理学家让•皮亚杰，但他对人类学的认识无疑是来自分析集体表现而形成的“原始思维”的 观念。,"He takes his basic ideas from the Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget, but true to his anthropological understanding he develops the notion of ‘primitive thought’ through the analysis of collective representations."
5619,共同利益社团在人类学文献中常被称作自愿社团，但这个术语具有误导性。,"Common-interest associations often have been referred to in the anthropological literature as voluntary associations, but this term is misleading."
5619,加入社团的行为可能是完全自愿的，也可能是法律要求的。,The act of joining may range from a fully voluntary act to one required by law.
5619,例如，在美国，受制于《征兵法》，个体往往毫无选择地成为军队的一员。,"For example, inthe United States, under the draft laws individuals often became members of the armed forces without choosing to join."
5619,加入工会实际上不是强迫性的，但一个人只有加入某个工会，他才能在工会认可的商店或工厂工作。自愿社团这个术语真正所指的是：那些不根据性别、年龄、亲属关系、婚姻或地区，因加入行为而产生的社团。,"It is not really compulsory to join a labor union, but unless potential employees do, they cannot work in a union shop.The term voluntary association really refers to associations not based on sex, age, kinship, marriage, or territory that result from the act of joining."
5619,加入行为往往可能是自愿的，但并非一定是自愿的。,"Therefore, the act often may be voluntary, but it does not have to be."
5620,"除了季节性或地方性的调适,寻食者还必须对资源有长期的调适。","In addition to seasonal or local adjustments, food foragers must make long-term adjustments to resources."
5620,大多数寻食民族似乎把人口数量稳定在他们的土地供养能力的水平之下。,Most food-foraging populations seem to stabilize at numbers well below the carrying capacity of their land.
5620,其实，大部分寻食者的居住范围都能供养他们一般供养人口的3—5倍。,"In fact, the home ranges of most food foragers could support from three to five times as many people as they typically do."
5620,"从长远的观点看，与其无限制地扩张人口，冒因突发的、意外的食物资源自然减少而遭毁灭的风险，还不如保持人口数置的低水平,这对于一个群体来说更适合。","In the long run, it may be more adaptive for a group to keep its numbers low, rather than to expand indefinitely and risk destruction by a sudden and unexpected natural reduction in food resources."
5621,但是，宗教所做的不止于此，它还为可接受的行为提供指南。,"Religion does more than this, though; it sets precedents for acceptable behavior."
5621,我们已经提到过神话和宗教之间的联系了。,We already have noted the connection between myths and religion.
5621,通常，神话有许多关于各种超自然存在的传说，这些传说以各种不同的方式说明了社会行动的伦理准则。,"Usually, myths are full of tales of supernatural beings that in various ways illustrate the society ethical code in action."
5621,所以，格卢斯卡布——佩诺布斯科特人的文化英雄——在佩诺布斯科特的传统中被描绘成一个作弄、惩罚那些嘲笑他人、撒谎、贪婪或者有极端行为的人。,"So it is that Gluskabe, the Penobscot culture hero, is portrayed in the Penobscot myths as tricking and punishing those who mock others, lie, are greedy, or go in for extremes of behavior."
5621,此外，神话中的具体情境还充当在类 似环境中人类行为的指南。,"Moreover, the specific situations serve as precedents for human behavior in similar circumstances."
5622,布尔迪厄在本质上是反对静态的结构观的。,Bourdieu is essentially arguing against a static notion of structure.
5622,最重要的是，惯习介于主客观之间、集体和个体之间。,"Crucially, habitus lies between the objective and the subjective, the collective and the individual."
5622,虽然不同文化对它的定义不同， 但其焦点是个体的意愿。,"It is culturally defined, but its locus is the mind of the individual."
5622,,Habitus is a kind of structure of social action by culturally competent performers.
5623,但是，对违反规则做法的允许似乎违背了当代世界的本质。,An acceptance of irregularities might seem to go against the grain of the contemporary world.
5623,“各会员国主权平等”原则庄严地载入《联合国宪章》的第二条第一款。,"The UN Charter, Article 2(1), enshrines the principle of ""the sovereign equality of all its Members""."
5623,在联合国时代，各国际组织承诺在全球范围来实施这一原则，这是史无前例的。,The commitment of international organisations in the UN period to the global application of this principle is historically unparalleled.
5623,非殖民化进程有力地强化了认为完全的主权是当代世界体系最基本的制度这一观点。,The decolonisation process has powerfully reinforced the view that full sovereign statehood is the most basic institution of the contemporary international system.
5624,我们由此而看到，将埃赫那顿王朝革命解释为哲学或神学事件的那些人.是依据对立的哲学以说明政治事件的，但他们却未曾解释哲学本身。,"Thus we see that those who interpret the revolution of Iknaton's reign as a philosophical, or theological, affair account for political events in terms of rival philosophies, but they do not explain the philosophies."
5624,我们的理论则阐明了这两者。,Our theory does both.
5624,我们是依据世俗社会的结构，以及作为整合与调节机构的国家一教会的职能，来阐述埃赫那顿与祭师集团之间的斗争的。,It explains the struggle between Ikhnaton and the priests in terms of the structure of civil societies and the function of the State-Church as an integrative and regulative mechanism.
5624,我们把哲学解释为祭师与同工在这场争斗中所使用的手段。,And it explains the philosophies as instruments used by priests and king in this struggle.
5624,埃赫那顿的哲学归于失败，是因为祭师集团的政治、经济力量较之法老集团强得多所致。,The philosophy of Ikhnaton failed because the political and economic power of the priesthoods was greater than that of the Pharaoh's party.
5625,我和施瓦茨在《政治人类学》（Political Anthropology）一书中的前言部分将社会戏剧或者政治的阶段性发展过程称作更为复杂的过程化单位，因此当我们对社会戏剧这一概念进行审视的时候都必须为这些清晰可辨的场景寻找一个恰当的术语，这些场景中相互对立抗争的行为总是发生在阶段性转折的一些重要的时刻。,"In any case, when we examine social dramas or political phase developments, as Swartz and I called the rather more elaborate processual units we discussed in the Introduction to Political Anthropology (1966), we have to find a term for those clearly visible settings for antagonistic action characteristic of the critical points of processual change."
5625,如果我们采用马克˙施瓦茨关于竞技场所 的定义并认为“竞技场所”是一个比“场景”包罗更广的位，那么我们还必须再另寻一个术语来表示政治斗牛场（political bull ring)这一包含了对立、遭遇以及竞争的概念。,"If we accept Marc Swartz's definition of ""arena"" as a more inclusive unit than ""field,"" then we have to find another term for our political bull ring, our cockpit of confrontation, encounter, and contention.But why not retain the more familiar usage here?"
5625,如果真是这样，我们为何不沿用竞技场所这个词所固有的含义呢？,
5626,"在我看来，这些思想家们并没有阐释清楚共同体和结构之间的区别；当他们像马丁˙海德格尔那样将社会本身看作“人类不真实的一部分""的时候，他们在谈论的应该是结构。","To my mind these thinkers tiave failed to make the analytical distinction between communitas and structure; it is structure they seem to be talking about when they speak as Martin Heidegger does of the social self as the ""unauthentic part of human-being."""
5626,但是，他们确实正致力于营造出一个“真实的个体”的共同体或者试图将此类个体从社会结构中拯救出来。,"But they are really addressing themselves to a communitas of ""authentic individuals"" or trying to liberate such individuals from social structure."
5626,人们也许会问，这些被异化的沉思默想的先知们尽管著述颇丰，但谁会成为他们的观众呢？,One migHistory and Theory in Anthropologysk who is the audience of these prolific if alienated prophets of uncommunication?
5626,然而这不是我们需要讨论的问题，我们需要探讨的是社会戏剧、过程化分析、反结构以及仪式符号的语义研究等方面之间的关系。,"But this is diverging from my main topic, which is to consider the relations between social drama, processual analysis, anti-structure, and semantic study of ritual symbols."
5627,教仪式是活动中的宗教。,
5627,通过宗教行动，社会纽带得到强化生命中的危机时刻是举行仪式的恰当时机。,
5627,阿诺尔德˙范˙根纳普杷这种生命礼仪分为分离、过渡和融入三个阶段。,"Arnold Van Gennep divided such rites of passage into rites of separation, transition, and incorporation."
5627,强化仪式是标志群体生活而非个体生活危机时刻的仪式。,Rites of intensification are rituals to mark crisis occasions in the life of the group rather than the individual.
5627,它们能够把人们团结起来，减少对危机的恐惧，并促发集体行动。,"They serve to unite people, allay fear of the crisis, and prompt collective action."
5627,葬礼上的各种仪式是人们失去亲人或朋友之后，为人们重新进行社会调适而提供的强化仪式。,Funerary ceremonies are rites of intensification that provide for social readjustment after the loss of the deceased.
5627,强化仪式还可能包括寻求吉利条件的一年一度的庆典——在诸如播种和收获等重要活动前后举行。,Rites of intensification also may involve annual ceremonies to seek favorable conditions surrounding critical activities such as planting and harvesting.
5628,然而，人们并不总是自由地做出自己的选择。经常发生的情况是，人们自己不愿意作改变，某些其他群体却把改变强加在他们头上，通常这发生在征服和殖民过程中。,"Not always, however, are people free to make their own choices; frequently, changes they would not willingly make themselves have been forced upon them by some other group, usually in the course of conquest and colonialism."
5628,许多情况的直接结果是人类学家叫作涵化的现象。,A direct outcome in many cases is a phenomenon anthropologists call acculturation.
5629,在一个完全不同的环境里，一开始，你在掌握语言和行为规则方面往往比较弱，在许多情境下也会感到无助。,"In a foreign setting, one will usually master the language and the codes for behaviour poorly at the beginning, and one will feel helpless in many situations."
5629,此外，你还会遭遇怀疑和敌意，以及在应付不习惯的气候、奇怪的事物和不同的卫生标准时身体的极端不适应。,"Besides, one runs the risk of encountering suspicion and hostility, and it can be profoundly unpleasant for the body to have to cope with an unfamiliar climate, strange food and a different hygienic standard than one is accustomed to."
5629,最后但并非最不重要的一点是，对于具有“西方”中产阶级背景（这是大多数人类学家的情况）的人来说，去适应那些认为独处是一种可怜或病态情形的社会是一件相当困难的事情。,"Last but not least, it can be very trying for people with a middle-class ""Western"" background (which is that of most anthropologists) to adapt to societies where being alone is considered a pitiful or pathological condition."
5630,自我行动涉及的行为环境不只是客体定向。,The behavioral environment the self acts in involves more than object orientation.
5630,行动也需要空间定向的能力，即从一个客体或地点转向另一个客体或地点的能力。,"Action requires spatial orientation, or the ability to get from one object, or place, to another."
5630,在任何社会，地点的名称和有意义的特点是区别和代表空间定向参照点的重要手段。,"In all societies, names and significant features of places are important means of discriminating and representing points of reference for spatial orientation."
5631,在西方社会，一般认为这个父亲应该是这个母亲的丈夫，但是他并不非得是母亲的丈夫在美国，虽然未婚妈妈的孩子可能被说成是“非法的”，但是他的公民权以及继承权并不被否认。,"In Western societies generally, the father is supposed to be the mother Kusbandj but he does not have to be.In the United States, the child of an unwed mother may be spoken of as aillegitimate, yet its citizenship rights, as well as those of inheritance, are not denied."
5631,合法性也不要求父亲必须与母亲结婚。,Nor does legitimacy require the father to be married to the mother.
5631,在其他许多社会中——譬如，在北美西南部的普埃布洛民族（诸如霍皮人）中——父亲身份与孩子的合法性毫无关系。,"In numerous other societies—for example, among the Pueblo peoples (such as the Hopi) of the North American Southwest—fatherhood is utterly irrelevant to the child's legitimacy."
5631,在他们的社会中，合法性自动来自其母亲，不管她是否已结婚。,"In their societies legitimacy comes automatically from one s mother, regardless of whether or not she is married."
5632,与其他的称谓系统不同，爱斯基摩制为核心家庭的成员提供了单独而明确的称谓。,"Unlike other terminologies, the Eskimo system provides separate and distinct terms for each nuclear family member."
5632,这可能是因为爱斯基摩制通常存在于双边亲属社会中，在那里占支配地位的亲属群体是亲类，只有直系亲的成员才在日常事务中起重要作用。,"This is probably because the Eskimo system generally is found in societies where the dominant kin group is the bilateral kindred, in which only immediate family members are important in day-to-day affairs."
5632,这特别符合现代北美社会的特点，在那里，家庭是独立的，除了仪式性的场合，他们总是和其他 亲属分开居住，也不直接与后者发生联系。,"This is especially true of modern North American society, where the family is independent, living apart from, and not directly involved with, other kin except on ceremonial occasions."
5632,这样，美国人区分他们最亲密的亲属 (父母和同胞兄弟姐妹），而把家庭双方的其他亲属都归到一起（称为姑姨伯母、叔伯舅、堂表兄弟姐妹）。,"Thus, people in the United States distinguish between their closest kin"
5633,大多数北美人熟悉的配偶家庭形式是独立的核心家庭，尽管它急剧衰退，但在美国和加拿大仍被广泛地视为一种理想。,"The form of conjugal family most familiar to most North Americans is the independent nuclear family, which in spite of its precipitous decline is still widely regarded as the ""standard"" in the United States and Canada."
5633,在这些国家中，年轻人在超过一定的年龄之后就不希望与自己的父母生活在一起，而一对夫妇也并没有一种道德上的责任要把自己因年迈而生活无法隹理的父母接到自己家中。,"In these countries it is not considered desirable for young people to live with their parents beyond a certain age, nor is it considered a moral responsibility for a couple to take their aged parents into their home when the parents no longer can care for themselves."
5633,退休社区和护理院可以提供这些服务，把年老的父母接到自己的家中，一般不仅被视为是一种经济负担，而且也是对该家户的隐私和独立性的一种威胁。,"Retirement communities and nursing homes provide these services, and to take aged parents into one's home is commonly regarded as not only an economic burden but also a threat to the households privacy and independence."
5634,作为欧洲人后代的北美人最尊重的核心价值或许是“严格的个人主义”，从传统上看这是适合于男子的，最近几十年里也适合于妇女。,"Perhaps the core value North Americans of European descent hold in highest esteem is ""rugged individualism,"" at least for men (only recently has this become recognized as a valid ideal for women)."
5634,假如有尽心竭力工作的愿望，每个个体应当都能够获得他或她想要的任何东西。,"Each individual is supposed to be able to achieve anything he or she likes alone, given a willingness to work hard enough."
5634,从他们年幼的时候开始，个人就受到要胜过他人的无休止的压力，就如我们前面指出的，竞争和获胜被视为 这一价值观的关键所在。,"From their earliest years, individuals are subjected to relentless pressures to excel, and, as we have already noted, competition and winning are seen as crucial to this."
5634,"毫无疑问，这促进北美社会的“永不满足感”和“内在驱力”，在某种程度上说,它促使个人努力工作，到经济需要他们的地方去，这非常符合工业社会和后工业社会的需要。","Undoubtedly, this value contributes to the ""restlessness"" and a drivenness, of North American society, and to the degree it motivates individuals to work hard and to go where the economy needs them, it fits well with the needs of an industrial society."
5635,不幸的是，在上中层阶级白人和黑人中有一种普遍的感觉：这种方言在某种程度上是不够标准或有缺陷的，它不是标准语言。,"Unfortunately, a widespread perception among upper- and middle-class Whites and Blacks alike is that this dialect is somehow substandard or defective, which it is not."
5635,语言学的基本原则是，对有声望的方言加以选择——既然如此，我们可以称“标准英语”是与“黑人语”相对的——是由偶然的语言外的力量决定的，而且不取决于方言本身的间接功效。,"A basic principle of linguistics is that the selection of a prestige dialect in this case, what we may call Standard English as opposed to Ebonics—is determined by accidental extralinguistic forces and is not dependent on indirect virtues of the dialects themselves."
5635,事实上，“美国黑人方言英语”是具有高级结构的语言模式，能够表达说该语言的人想要表达的任何东西，（如在“闲聊”中）经常以极富创造性的方式表达事情。,"In fact, African American Vernacular English is a highly structured mode of speech, capable of expressing anything its speakers care to express, often in extremely creative ways (as in ""rapping"")."
5636,第一个群体将生活看做是唯物论，看做是照片上的纪念碑和寺庙，或是看做展览中的人工制品和标本。,"The first group sees life as materialistic, as monuments and temples in photographs or as artifacts and specimens on exhibit."
5636,这一看法受到一种进化论或相似的采取一种全景或宏观视角模式的影响。,"This view is informed by an evolutionary or similar schema that takes a panoramic, or macro, view."
5636,第二个群体更关注微观世界，即在其文化背景下个体演员的生活的意义和微妙的社会关系。,The second group is more concerned with a microcosm: the meaning of life to individual actors in their cultural context and the subtleties of social relationships.
5637,对非预期结果的设定是一种手段，由此，民族志作者就能将分析推进到超越起初田野工作的地点之外，用文化的、在结构上相应的术语对宏大体系（传统上被认为是柚象结构）进行再现。,"The postulate of unintended consequences is a means by which an ethnographer can push analysis beyond the locale of primary fieldwork to representations of the macro-system (conventionally conceived as abstract structures) in cultural, structurally contingent terms."
5637,威利斯充分运用这一策略，诺尔-塞蒂娜将这一策略视为（第213页见脚注①）将宏观视角带回到微观视角下的、生产力占主导的当前状况的一种模式。,"Willis makes full use of this move, which Knorr-Cetina discusses (see footnote 6) as one of the modes of bringing macro perspectives back into the current reign of productivity in micro perspectives."
5637,实际上《学会劳动》的主旨就在于讨论那些小伙子在学校形成的对抗文化的非预期结果：作为学校里阶级冲突的讽刺性结果，他们如何系统地使自己丧失获得中产阶级工作的资格；在不存在强制的情况下，年轻人如何将自己埋葬在工场车间。,"In fact, the central argument of the book is the one about the unintended consequences of the lads' oppositional culture formed at school: how they systematically disqualify themselves from middle class jobs as the ironic effect of class conflict in the schools; how, without coercion , youths funnel themselves onto the shop floor."
5638,与此相关的理论是他的“话语”概念。,A related notion has been his idea of ‘discourse’.
5638,在语言学中，“话语”通常是指“连续”的讲话（例如：类似与文章中的段落或较长的写作片段），但福柯扩展了它的含义。,"While in linguistics, ‘discourse’ has generally held the meaning of ‘continuous’ speech (e.g., what might be analogous to a paragraph or longer segment in writing), in Foucauldian usage it is widened."
5638,在福柯那里，它所涵盖的既有人们的说话和写作方式，又有其中包含的所有知识，还有这些知识的运用，就像福柯最关注的权力的结构。,"Here it represents a concept involving the way people talk or write about something, or the body of knowledge implied, or the use of that knowledge, such as in the structures of power which were Foucault’s overwhelming concern."
5639,唤起既不是表现也不是再现。,Evocation is neither presentation nor representation.
5639,它不表现也不再现客体，然而它通过不在场让人得到了那些可以被构想但却不能被表现的东西。,"It presents no objects and represents none, yet it makes available through absence what can be conceived but not presented."
5639,从而它超越了真实并免于表现的评判。,It is thus beyon d truth and immune to the judgment of performance.
5639,它克服了可感之物和可构想之物的分离、形式和内容的分离、自我和他者的分离，以及语言和世界的分离。,"It overcomes the separation of the sensible and the conceivable, of form and content, of self and other, of language and the world."
5639,唤起——也就是说，“民族志”——是后现代世界的话语，因为制造科学并由科学制造的世界已经失落，科学思想现在只是意识的一个陈旧模式，如果没有民族志语境来创造和维持它，它就只能幸存一阵子，还是以衰退的形式而幸存。,"Evocation—that is to say, ""ethnography""—is the discourse of the post - modern world, for the world that made science, and that science made, has disappeared, and scientific thought is now an archaic mode of consciousness surviving for a while yet in degraded form without the ethnographic context that created and sustained it."
5640,"对很多欧洲人和欧裔美国人来说，当提到“艺术”这个词的时候,首先跃入脑海的就是某种图画，它也许是一幅油画、一幅铅笔画、一幅素描或随便什么画。","To many Europeans and European Americans, the first image that springs to mind in connection with the word art is some sort of picture, be it a painting, drawing, sketch, or whatever."
5640,"确实， 在世界的很多地方，人们长期以来一直以某种方式作画——铭刻在骨头上，雕刻在岩石上，画在山洞和岩石的表面，刻画在木头、葫芦和罐子上，或者画在纺织品、树皮、树皮织的布、兽皮,甚至绘在他们自己的身体上。","And indeed, in many parts of the world, people have been making pictures in one way or another for a very long time—etching them in bone; engraving them in rock; painting them on cave walls and rock faces; carving and painting them on wood, gourds, or pots; or painting them on textiles, bark, bark cloth, animal hide, or even their own bodies."
5640,就像音乐艺术一样，每一种历史上已知的人类文化都有某种形式的绘画艺术。,"As with musical art, some form of pictorial art is a part of every historically known human culture."
5641,当陆军军官提到“紧急条令”和“担保破坏”，医生说起“放血”，牙医说到“口腔”，或者人类学家说“母方交表兄妹婚姻的结构含义”时，他们至少在某种程度上表现出他们在行业中的成员身份以及他们掌握的行业语言^財内行人来说，职业术语强化了他们对精选的“内群体”的归属感；对外行人来说，使用这种“难懂的行话”往往是没有必要的，是炫耀之举，在这种场合便用完全适当而简单的词就行。,"When a military officer speaks of ""incontinent ordinance"" and ""collateral damage"", a physician of exsanguination, a denrist of the aoral cavity or an anthropologist of ctthe structural implications of matrilateral cross-cousin marriage, they express, in part at least, their membership in a profession and their command of its language.For insiders, professional terminology reinforces their sense of belonging to a select in-group; to outsiders it often seems an unneeded and pretentious use of ""bafflegab"" where perfectly adequate and simple words would do as well."
5641,不管是否必要，职业术语确实有助于区分语言，使一个群体的言语跟其他群体的言语区别开来。,"Whether needed or not, professional terminology does serve to differentiate language and to set the speech of one group apart from that of others."
5641,因此，它是促使语体趋异的力量。,"Therefore, it is a force for stylistic divergence."
5642,视文化为地域性单位的看法不适合研究全球背景下的文化变迁，在全球背景下，“文化倾向于重叠和混合”（Hannerz 1990:239)。,"This image of cultures as bounded units is not appropriate for studying cultural change in the global context, where ""cultures tend to overlap and mingle"" (Hannerz 1990: 239)."
5642,但是，我却对这种看法表示质疑，即这是否真正代表一种新的文化思考方法。,But I would  question whether this represents a genuinely new way of thinking about cultures.
5642,虽然文化是地域性单位的看法在人类学界具有强大的势力和影响，但文化边界的性质却一直没有界定。,"Although the impression that cultures are bounded units has been strong and influential in anthropological thought, the nature of cultural boundaries has often been left undefined."
5642,大多数跨文化的比较都是在筛选出来的文化事象、亲属称谓、婚姻规则、宗教或政治思想等文化现象中进行的。,"Most cross-cultural comparisons are of selected phenomena, kinship terminologies, marriage rules, religious or political ideologies."
5642,在这种比较中，没有必要考虑文化的边界是什么样的。此外，人类学的许多研究与跨文化的知识交流有着明确的关联性，因此可以假定文化在某种程度上是没有边界的，至少人类学的研究暗示了这一点。,"In such comparisons there is no need to consider what the edges of a culture might look like.In addition, there are many studies in anthropology which deal explicitly with the cross-cultural communication of knowledge and which therefore, at least implicitly, assume that cultures are to some degree unbounded."
5643,伯尔德有关狩猎一采集经济的分析中最有意义的论点是， 经济或任何经济都可以视为既具有文化成分又具有技术成分，使经济具有独特性的是文化成分（Gudeman 1986)。,"The most significant general point to emerge from Bird-David's analysis of hunter-gatherer economies is that an economy, any economy, can be seen as having both cultural and technological components, and that it is the cultural component that makes ane (see Gudeman 1986)."
5643,在伯尔德的分析中，区分狩猎一采集经济在很大程度上并不是其技术特征——被划分为游耕或定居农耕者的社会也会在一定程度上以狩猎和采集等技术手段获取食物。,"In Bird-David's analysis, what distinguishes the hunter-gatherer economy is not so much its technological character—communities which have been classified as shifting or settled cultivators also engage in a variety of modes of ""procurement"", including hunting and gathering."
5643,狩猎一采集经济的不同之处就在于它有赖于供给环境而不是其他类型的环境。,
5644,在这里，联系基于劳动分工：屠户用他的肉来换钱，面包师用他的面包来换钱，然后屠户才能用换来的钱去买面包，而面包师也才可能用换来的钱去买肉。,"Here connections are based on division of labor: the butcher exchanges his meat for money, the baker exchanges his bread for money, and with that money the butcher can buy bread and the baker, meat."
5644,每个人都先完成他自己的工作，彼此有益的交换，就是将社会连接到一起的东西。,"Each does his own work, and mutually useful exchange is what holds the society together."
5644,依照涂尔干的看法，机械团结可以在传统社区发现。,"Mechanical solidarity is, according to Durkheim, found in traditional communities."
5644,团结不来自劳动分工和经济交换。,Unity does not come from division of labor and economic exchange.
5644,相反，大家都做同一件事，团结基于共有的道德，对一个唯一的规范和信仰抱有牢固的承诺。,"Instead, everyone works at the same thing, and unity is based on shared morality, a firm commitment to a single norm and belief."
5645,基本结构包括直接交换的各种体系，也就是说，一个集团与另一个集团互换妻子。,"Elementary structures include systems of direct exchange, where a group may ‘take’ wives from the same group it ‘gives’ wives to."
5645,最简单的一种形式就是一个男人与其母亲的兄弟的女儿（MBD)或父亲的姊妹的女儿（FZD)结婚，就像在南美和澳大利亚的一些地方那样。,"The simplest type is one involving marriage between a man and his mother’s brother’s daughter (MBD) or father’s sister’s daughter (FZD), as in some parts of South America and Australia."
5645,基本结构还包括延迟直接交换制度。,Elementary structures also include systems of delayed direct exchange.
5646,田野工作也是一种过渡仪式。,"Fieldwork is a rite of passage, too."
5646,田野体验据说可以从根本上让人发生自我改观，它有些像精神分析，像洗脑，但它也是一种入会仪式，通过考验和洞见，从最初的水平发展到一个新的成熟的水平。,"The field experience is said to be radically self-transforming; it is like psychoanalysis, like brainwashing, but it is also an initiation ritual that, through ordeals and insights, moves the initiate to a new level of maturity."
5646,与此相似的一个例子就是皈依体验，在这一体验中，借用一个基督教中极其常见的短语，就是一个人获得“再生”。,"A parallel is the conversion experience in which, to use a phrase popularized in fundamentalist Christianity, one is ""born again""."
5647,大多数英国（和欧洲）的人类学，依然坚持涂尔干提出的社会学与心理学的分离，认为社会领域的研究主题是社会力量，因而纯粹基于社会事实，这使得个体意识被看作是毫不相关的、不可复原的或不存在的。,"In much British (and European) anthropology, notwithstanding, a Durkheimian legacy, which insisted on a separation of the sociological and the psychological, and posited a social realm which was subject simply to social forces and hence home purely to social facts, causedindividual consciousness to be seen as irrelevant, irretrievable or nonexistent."
5647,相反，“集体道德”则被提出来，由社会成员通过“集体表象”而共享。,"Instead, a ‘collective conscience’ was posited in which all members of a society were said to partake via ‘collective representations’."
5647,至于个体所拥有的意识的程度则根据个体所处的社会文化环境的结构性逻辑决定：处于X群体或X阶层或X角色就意味着具有X意识。,"To the extent that individuals were recognized as possessing consciousness, this latter was identified with the structural logic of that individual’s social or cultural circumstances: to live in group X or class X or role X was to possess X consciousness."
5648,同样的效果也适用于那些认为时间循环、或循环多于线性的、或者具有其他某种节奏的社会与文化。,"The same effect is said to pertain in societies and cultures where time is circular or cyclical rather than linear, or possessed of some other rhythm."
5648,重要的是，时间总要有节奏（因此也就是瞬间性的），在涂尔干和莫斯的影响深远的表达中（1970），这被看作是集体意识的表述和证明。,"What is significant is that time always has a rhythmical (and hence momentary) quality and that, in Durkheim and Mauss's influential formulation (1970), it is seen as a representation and a manifestation of a conscience collective."
5648,"当与其他社会文化差别一道考虑时，更确切地说，时间可被认为源自社会的“集体思想”，因此也就是它体现了所处的社会文化环境（Durkheim and Mauss 1970: 85, 66）。","As with other socio-cultural distinctions, that is, time can be seen as emanating from ‘the collective mind’ of society, and thus as coming to ‘express’ the socio-cultural milieu in which it is practised (Durkheim and Mauss 1970:85, 66)."
5649,任何社会都控制对土地和其他贵重资源的配置。,All societies regulate the allocation of land and its valuable resources.
5649,在非工业社会，个人土地所有权是罕见的。一般来说，土地是由诸如世系群或队群等亲属群体控制的。,"In nonindustrial societies, individual ownership of land is rare; generally, land is controlled by kinship groups, such as the lineage or band."
5649,这种体制给予土地使用的灵活性，因为队群及其领土的规模可按特定地区的可用资源加以调整。,"This system provides greater flexibility of land use, since the size of the bands and their territories can be adjusted according to the availability of resources in any particular place."
5649,人们的技术，他们所使用工具的形式以及相关的知识与他们的生存方式相关。,"The technology of a people, in the form of the tools they use and associated knowledge, is related to their mode of subsistence."
5649,在寻食社会中，慷慨的行为准则提倡免费享用工具，尽管个人也许为自己使用而制作这些工具。,"In food-foraging societies, codes of generosity promote free access to tools, even though individuals may have made them for their own use."
5650,全球论者也类似于欧里奥旦（O’Riordan)所说的“技术中心论者”，希望工业社会减少对环境的破坏，而不去质疑其目标和价值体系，反全球论者则接近于他所说的“生态中心论者”，劝诫人类应当谦卑地面对自然，倡导采用对环境影响较小的（low-impact) 技术和自给自足的生产模式 （O’Riordan 1981[1976])。,"Globalists also seem similar to O'Riordan's ""technocentrists"", who wish to make industrial society more environmentally benign without questioning its goals or values, and anti-globalists appear similar to his ""ecocentrists"", who preach humility for the processes and products of nature and advocate low-impact technology and self-reliance (O'Riordan 1981 [1976])."
5650,但在工业社会的背景下，这两种视角只能被描述为“保守主义” (全球论）和“激进主义”（反全球论）。,"But the two perspectives can only be described as ""conservative"" (globalism) and ""radical"" (antiglobalism) in the context of industrial society."
5650,这对于分析基本上发生在工业社会内部的社会运动是合适的，但用于分析这种有许多社会参与其中的全球性辩论就不合适了。,"This was appropriate enough for the analysis of a social movement taking place largely within industrial societies, but it is not appropriate for analysing a global debate in which many different societies are involved."
5651,这样，首领位置的继承是由一个男性传给他外甥的。,"Thus, succession to positions of leadership passes from a man to his sister's son."
5651,由于这个原因，一个按常规管理其继嗣群体财产的男性，将带着他的妻子与他继承的那个人——他的舅舅生活在一起。,"For this reason, a man who is in line to take control of his descent group's assets will take his wife to live with the one he will succeed—his mother's brother."
5651,这使他能够观察他舅舅怎样管理小村庄的事务，还能学会口述传统和巫术——他需要这些东西来成为一个有效的首领。,"This enables him to observe how the older man takes care of his hamlet's affairs, as well as to learn the oral traditions and magic he will need to be an effective leader."
5651,尽管特罗布里恩德群岛岛民的头领和首领们是从舅居生活的，但是这个社会绝大多数的已婚夫妇却是从父居生活的。,"Although Trobriand leaders and chiefs live avunculocally, most married couples in this society live patrilocally."
5651,这使儿子们能履行他们对父亲的义务，后者在他们小时候养肓了他们作为回报，儿子将从父亲那里继承诸如陶罐和贵重的石斧、石刀等个人财产。,"This allows sons to fulfill their obligations to their fathers, who helped build up and nurture them when they were small; in return, the sons will inherit personal property such as day pots and valuable stone axe blades from their fathers."
5652,家是微观意义上的社区，通过开放和经常性的交流、劳动分工、权利和义务、共进晚餐以及资源的轮换等手段来协调其成员。这超越了极权模式。,"Homes were communities in microcosm which coordinated their members by way of open and constant communication, a division of labour, rights and duties, a commensal meal, and a rotation of access to resources."
5652,后者采取强制性的手段控制成员的思想、身体和言论以维护稳定。,"They encompassed totalprestatory systems which exerted possibly tyrannous control over their members’ minds, bodies and tongues in their search for solidarity."
5653,这一检验清楚地表明，人们相信或说出他们所做的，与垃圾分析显示出他们实际所做的，有相当火的差异。,The tests clearly show a significant difference between what people say they do and what garbage analysis shows they actually do.
5653,例如，1973年，常规技术被用来设计和处理问卷，旨在发现图森市的酒类消费率。,"For example, in 1973, conventional techniques were used to construct and administer a questionnaire to find out about the rate of alcohol consumption in Tucson."
5653,在城市的一个地区，15%的受调查的家庭确认消费啤酒，但是没有一个家庭报告一周消费超过8罐。,"In one part of town, 15% of respondent households affirmed consumption of beer, but no household reported consumption of more than eight cans a week."
5653,然而，从同一地区的垃圾分析证实，80%以上的家庭消费某种啤酒，50%的家庭每周丢弃的空罐超过8个。,"Analysis of garbage from the same area, however, demonstrated that some beer was consumed in more than 80% of households, and 50% discarded more than eight empty cans a week."
5654,亲属关系是自身建构，这是非洲功能主义人类学(functionalist anthropology)秉持的一个不言自明的道理，也是一个真理。,"It was one of the truisms, and also one of the truths, of Africanist functionalist anthropology that kinship is itself constructed."
5654,没有像“自然”家庭这样的事情。,"There is no such thing as a ""natural"" family."
5654,关于这一点，除了女人生孩子，所有的事情都是由历史上产生的并不断变化和发展着的社会契约决定的，这些契约比任何一种族性覆盖的范围都要广得多。,"Everything about it, except that women give birth, is determined by historically produced social agreements which extend over areas far wider than any single ethnicity, but which can change and develop."
5655,意识的控制所造就的对环境反应的可塑性将会极大增加原始人类的适应能力。,"Engendered by conscious control, a plasticity of environmental response would have greatly increased hominid fitness."
5655,环境中对原始人类来说重要的部分会以它自己的方式联系起来：家庭和朋友，自我之外的陌生人和敌人。,"A significant part of this environment, moreover, for the hominid, would long have concerned others of its own kind: family and friends, strangers and enemies beyond the self."
5655,预测他们的活动，推测他们的行为，这也会带来适应优势。,"Anticipating their movements, predicting their behaviour, would also confer adaptive advantage."
5656,要成为一个群体的一员，一个人只需缴纳必需的会费、参加会议和参与该群体的事务。,"To activate a membership, one simply pays the required dues, attends meetings, and participates in the groups' affairs."
5656,个体可以同时属于两个或三个他们有资格参加的群体，而他们实际上也常常如此。,"Individuals can, and frequently do, belong at the same time to two or three groups they are eligible for."
5656,每一个家庭圈都有一个名字，这名字中通常包含男性袓先的姓氏；每一个家庭圈都选出了自己的管理者；每一个家庭圈的成员在一年之中都定期会面，而非只碰头一两次。,"Each family circle bears a name, usually including the surname of the male ancestor; each has elected officers; and each meets regularly throughout the year rather than just once or twice."
5656,至少，家庭圈作为一个团体拥有公共资金，有些家庭圈还有为成员安排墓地的权利。,"At the least, the family circle as a corporation holds funds in common, and some hold title to burial plots for members."
5656,起先，它们就像互助社团那样发挥作用，同时也致力于维护家族的团结。,"Originally, they functioned as mutual-aid societies, as well as had the purpose of maintaining family solidarity."
5656,现在，由于互助功能已经被外部的机构承担，促进团结就成为它们首要的目标了。,"Now, as the mutual-aid functions have been taken over by outside agencies, the promotion of solidarity has become their primary goal."
5657,"在美国，普遍的信念是，家用设备消费用品的产出日益增长导致家务持续减少,相应的结果是闲暇时间增加。","In North American society, a widespread belief is that the ever-increasing output of household appliance consumer goods has resulted in a steady reduction in housework, with a consequent increase in leisure time."
5657,因此，消费用品已成为高标准生活的标志。,"Thus, consumer appliances have become principal indicators of a high standard of living."
5657,然而，对寻食者——为生存而依赖野生植物和动物资源的民族——的人类学研究已经表明，他们在家务活上、而且的确在生存事务上所花的时间比工业化社会中人们所花时间 更少。,"Anthropological research among food foragers (people who rely on wild plant and animal resources for subsistence), however, has shown that they work far less at household tasks, and indeed less at all subsistence pursuits, than do people in industrialized societies."
5657,例如，澳大利亚原住民妇女每周平均花将近20小时采集和烹调食物，以及做其他家庭的杂务。,"Aboriginal Australian women, for example, devote an average of approximately 20 hours per week to collecting and preparing food, as well as other domestic chores."
5658,贾吉摩尼制度从意识形态上与宗教相关，并通过宗教正当化，因此有助于维护洁净和不洁净的观念，维护种姓制度内的相对等级。,"The jajmani system is ideologically connected with and justified through religion, and thus contributes to maintaining notions about purity and impurity and about relative rank within the caste system."
5658,清扫夫的种姓成员实际上从事清扫的事实被用来作为证据，说明他们事实上是污染别人的；而同时，他们又不得不从事清扫，因为他们被认为是污染别人的。,"The fact that members of the sweeper caste actually sweep is interpreted as evidence that they are actually polluting; at the same time, they have to sweep because they are perceived as polluting."
5658,这样，种姓制度的社会和符号方面是相互关联的，并通过在意识形态和实践活动之间的联系互相强化。,"In this way, the social and symbolic aspects of caste are interconnected, and contribute to reinforcing each other by creating a correspondence between ideology and practices."
5658,传统上，贾吉摩尼系统很少有金钱流通，大部分是通过商品和服务的直接交换而构成。,"Traditionally, little money circulated through the jajmani system, which largely consisted of direct exchange of goods and services."
5659,如果这个解释是正确的，哈格罗夫就是在面对冲突的价值观时肯定一种传统主义，一种尊敬老年人的价值观。,"If this interpretation is correct, Hargrove is afffirming a certain traditionalism, a value of respect for the elderly in the face of conflicting values of informal congeniality."
5659,如果这是真实的，他也是在肯定有着深刻根源的价值观或思想体系，即看重荣誉和尊敬老人的传统，反对南方地域文化中文绉绉的种族主义和沙文主义。,"And if this is true, he is affirming values or ideologies that have deep roots.He taps traditions of honor and respect as well as perhaps a genteel racism and chauvinism in the southern regional culture of which Hargrove and this town are part."
5659,在那之外，从更为宽泛的意义上来讲，他肯定了关于年轻人和老年人之间、男性与女性之间的关系，肯定了礼节的意义、语言，以及文明规范中早已成为习惯的价值观。,"Beyond that, he affirms broadly human values concerning the relations between young and old, male and female, and the significance of manners, language, and ritual in civilized conduct."
5660,即使在不叫“嫁妆”的时候，送出适当的礼物经常是影响新娘与新郎两家关系的重要因素，或许也是影响新娘在其新家待遇的重要因素。,"Offering the proper gifts, even when not called ""dowry,"" is often an importarrt factor in influencing the relationship between the bride's and groom's families and perhaps, also, the treatment of the bride in her new home."
5660,在离婚仍是丑闻而离婚率又十分低的社会中，包办婚姻是终身关系的开端，而且不只是新娘与新郎之间的关系，也是他们两家之间关系的开端。,"In a society where divorce is still a scandal and where, in fact, the divorce rate is exceedingly low, an arranged marriage is: he beginning of a life-time relationship not just between the bride and groom but between their families as well."
5660,因此，姑娘的外貌是重要的，而她的性格甚至更加重要，因为人们同时从两方面评价她：未来的媳妇和未来的新娘。,"Thus, while a girl's looks are important her character is even more so, for she is being judged as a prospective daughter-in-law as much as a prospective bride."
5660,她将生活在联合家庭内，我朋友的情况就是这样，因此，在评价姑娘是否合适时，她与家庭成员和睦相处的能力也许是最重要的品质。,"Where she would be living in a joint family, as was the case with my friend, the girl's ability to get along harmoniously in a family is perhaps the single most important quality in assessing her suitability."
5661,人类学家则必须向那些他们参与其中进行研究的人们公开他们的目的，必须尽可能地解释他们是谁和他们想要做什么，并且不应该欺骗或强迫知情者去泄露他们不想泄露的东西。,"Anthropologists must declare their objectives openly to those with whom they are engaged in participant observation, must explain as best they can who they are and what they are about, and should not trick or force informants to divulge what they do not wish to divulge."
5661,每个人都知道一些民族志学者没有充分遵循这一规矩的事例，并且在有些情况下也很难完全做到它们，但是原则是清楚的。,"Everyone knows instances when ethnographers did not fully conform to this recipe, and some situations render it difficult to do so entirely, but the principles are clear."
5661,间谍是操纵活动，民族志是共享的——至少在原则上来说是这样。,"Spying is a manipulative activity, ethnography a sharing one, at least in principle."
5662,因此，墨利纳人的讲演可以说是社会控制的一种形式，体现一定的等级关系。,"Hence, Merina oratory may be described as a form of social control, and an expression of a hierarchical relationship."
5662,同时它又是高度均质化和非个体性的表述编码。,At the same time it is a highly ambiguous and impersonal codification of expression.
5662,即使已事先知道，这种代码的演说方式都不会根据特定情境、关系、政策或个性进行修改；它首要强调的是传统的秩序与角色。,"Since they are known in advance, utterances in this code cannot be tailored to particular cases or relationships or policies or personalities; conventional order and role are emphasized above all."
5663,对列维－斯特劳斯来说，乱伦禁忌是（人类）本性的一部分，因为它存在于所有社会之中。但乱伦禁忌也是文化的本质，因为不同文化对它的定义各不相同。,"For Le ́vi-Strauss, the incest taboo is part of (human) nature because it is present in all societies, but it is the essence of culture because it is defined differently from culture to culture."
5663,列维－斯特劳斯指出，有些文化禁止交表兄弟姊妹之间发生性关系，而另一些文化则恰好承认交表兄弟姊妹的范畴作为允许发生性关系的一种类别。,"Some cultures, Le ́vi-Strauss points out, prohibit sex between cross-cousins, while other cultures recognize the category of cross-cousins as precisely the one within which sex is allowed."
5664,作为结论出现的并不简单地是美国各族群身份的平行运行过程，而是一种感觉：这些族群归属只是构成了具有相似性的家族，族群归属不能被还原为同一的社会学功能，族群归属是两个或更多的文化传统之间的相互参照过程，这些文化间知识的动力学是人类价值更新的宝库。,"What emerges as a conclusion is not simply that parallel processes operate across American ethnic identities, but a sense that these ethnicities constitute only a family of resemblances, that ethnicity cannot be reduced to identical sociological functions, that ethnicity is a process of inter-reference between two or more cultural traditions, and that these dynamics of intercultural knowledge provide reservoirs for renewing humane values."
5664,族群记忆因此是或应该是朝向未来而不是朝向过去的。,"Ethnic memory is thus, or ought to be, future, not past, oriented."
5664,如果这个实验中有多重声音参与，那么，它也希望读者身份是多样化的。,"If multiple voices are engaged in this experiment, so, too, it is hoped , will multiple readerships."
5664,援引多个不同群体的话语为读者的不同意见提供了入口。,"By invoking the discourses of a number of different groups, access is provided to them for rejoinder."
5665,我们简略地考察当代北美社会的做法，就可以看到婚姻与交配区别。在北美社会，一夫一妻制（monogamy)——获得单个配偶——是唯一合法的婚姻形式。,"The distinction between marriage and mating may he seen by looking, briefly, at practices in contemporary North American society, where monogamy—the taking of a single spouse—is the only legally recognized form of marriage."
5665,不仅其他形式得不到法律认可，而且财产和财富得以从一代传到下一代的继承制度也以一夫一妻制婚姻制度为根据。,"Not only are other forms not legally sanctioned, but also systems of inheritance, whereby property and wealth are transferred from one generation to the next, are predicated upon the institution of monogamous marriage."
5665,相比之下，交配模式经常不是单配偶的。,"Mating patterns, by contrast, are frequently not monogamous."
5665,不仅在美国和加拿大通奸绝不是罕见的，而且异性个体——特别是未婚的年轻人——婚外同居已被认为是可接受的。,"Not only is adultery far from rare in the United States and Canada, but also it has become increasingly acceptable for individuals of the opposite sex particularly young people who have not yet married—to live together outside of wedlock."
5666,对人类学而言，交谈最关键的特点是它展现社会文化事实，“人们在谈话的时候就在演练和生产他们的文化、社会角色以及个性”（Moerman 1988：Ⅺ）。,"For anthropology, perhaps the key characteristic of conversation is that it gives onto socio-cultural reality; ‘[i]n every moment of talk, people are experiencing and producing their cultures, their roles, their personalities’ (Moerman 1988:xi)."
5666,交谈是一种相互作用，人类的事实就在其中不断地被生产和再生产出来，这个被建构的事实若没有个体意识的能动性就无法客观存在。,Conversation is a kind of interactionin which human reality—a constructed reality which does notobjectively exist beyond the consciousness of its individual agents—is continually created and recreated.
5666,敏锐地把握交谈中相互作用的微观过程，是人类学近年来逐渐关注的主题之一（参照Bauman and Sherzer 1974；Bruner 1983）。,A sensitivity to the micro-processes of conversational interaction is a growing anthropological concern (cf. Bauman and Sherzer 1974; Bruner 1983).
5667,齐美尔则坚信应当避免在机器里寻找幽灵：“社会就存在于大量个体参与投入的地方” (Simmel 1971：23)。,"The way forward Simmel believed in was to refrain from looking for a ghost in the machine; ""society exists where a number of individuals enter into interaction"" (1971:23)."
5667,互动就是社会文化的环境——不止是其原因和结果——除此之外，什么也没有。,The interactions are the socio-cultural milieu—not merely its cause or consequence—and there is nothing else.
5667,一个社会文化的环境就是一个波动的交易场所，只有参与其中的个体以其经验和创造力来分析才能够理解——个体创造多少社会和文化有赖于他参与的互动的数量和种类。,"A socio-cultural milieu amounts to a fluctuating field of transactions, only grasped by an analysis of the creativity and experience of its component individuals—individuals who create more or less society and culture depending on the number and types of interactions they enter into."
5668,社会阶级结构的基础是角色分化。,The basis of social class structure is role differentiation.
5668,当然，某些角色分化存在于任何一个社会，至少有依据性别和年龄的分化。,"Some role differentiation, of course, exists in any society, at least along the lines of sex and age."
5668,此外，任何必要的角色总会在某种程度上受到重视。,"Furthermore, any necessary role always will be valued to some degree."
5668,在寻食社会中，“好猎人”的角色将会受到重视。,"In a food-foraging society, the role of ""good hunter"" will be valued."
5668,但是，在一个平等社会中，已经有一个人承担了那个角色这一事实，并不阻碍另一个人承担它因此，角色分化本身并不足以造成分层。,"The fact one man already may play that role does not, however, prevent another man from playing it, too, in an egalitarian society.Therefore, role differentiation by itself is not sufficient for stratification."
5669,针对角色理论的另一个批评体现在以下观点中：自我是一个综合的整体，如果将其“剁成”几个分开的角色，未免太武断了。,"Another criticism which has been levelled against role theory is represented in the view that the self is an integrated whole and that it is artificial to ""chop it up"" into separated roles."
5669,这也许是事实——至少许多现代人可能会感到他们是“整合的人”——但是不同的社会关系却要求我们根据不同的情境建立特定的行为方式。,"This may be the case – at least many modern individuals may feel that they are ""integrated persons"" – but different social relationships nevertheless require of us that we develop specialised behaviour tailored to fit different situations."
5669,据推测，很少有人能够分别在其祖母、教授和朋友面前都表现得完全一致。,"Few persons, presumably, behave identically when they are with their grandmother, their professor and their friends, respectively."
5669,因为社会的人是通过他或她的社会关系而被建构的，并且这些关系会因为它们的内容而各有不同，当你遇见不同的人时，通过某种程度的印象管理，你必然会或多或少地变化你的行为方式。,"Since the social person is constituted through his or her social relationships, and since these relations vary in their content, one must necessarily vary one's behaviour somewhat, through some degree of impression management, when confronted with different persons."
5669,社会生活中的这种灵活性通常不会为个体行动者带来重大问题，但是他或她常常会遭遇到来自不同他人的相互冲突的期望——当它们同时出现的时候可能会引发难题。,"Usually this flexibility in social life does not lead to major problems for the individual actor, but quite often one meets conflicting expectations from different persons – which may present a problem when they arise simultaneously."
5670,1968年事件在东德造成的冲击是：新斯大林主义者（neo-Stalinist)埃里克˙霍尼克（Erich Honecker)强迫晚期斯大林主义者（late- Stalinist)尤里布里希辞职，以阻止事态向着类似于捷克斯洛伐克的方向发展。,In the GDR the impact of the year 1968 was that the neo-Stalinist Erich Honecker forced the late-Stalinist Ulbricht into resignation in order to prevent developments going in a direction similar to those in Czechoslovakia.
5670,新集团最初允许在国内的文化和教育中的几个领域进行有限的改革。,That new regime initially allowed for limited reforms in several fields of domestic culture and education.
5670,在霍尼克当政的最初几年，这一转变的结果之一就是东德的民族志和民族学在学科、人员、学生和研究的可能选择上出现了适度增长。,"One of the results of that turn during the first Honecker years was a modest growth in faculty, staff, students, and research possibilities in the ethnography and Völkerkunde of the GDR."
5671,在附录中.他逐字逐句地记录了那些男孩们在读过他的书之后作出的反应。,There he presents verbatim dialogued epicti n g the boys' reaction to their reading of his book.
5671,他们能够用自己的话，而不是用威利斯的解释性阐述来表述他们自己的观点。,"They can relate to their own words, but not to Willis's interpretive elaborations of their world view."
5671,他正确地指出，他没有认识到这点本身就证实了那些男孩对“脑力”劳动（具体表现在学术产品中）的拒绝而偏爱于“体力”劳动和直接经验，这种对立是工人人阶级文化的核心。,"Appropriately, he argues that this failure of recognitio n is itself a validation of their rejection of ""mental"" labor, which scholarly products embody, in favor of ""manual"" labor and immediate e xperience, an opposition at the heart of working class culture."
5671,因此，在细致审查之下，第二部分的理论讨是否真的能从第一部分的民族志讨论中推导出来就成了一个还有待讨论的问题：关键是，从修碎角度看，它们的确是有效地如此推导出来的。,"Thus, whether in fact, on close inspection, the theoretical discussions of part 2 can be derived from the ethnographic discussions of part 1 is an open question; the point is that rhetorically they are effectively so derived."
5672,艾德温·阿代纳（Edwin Ardener 1985)曾说，重要的概念将会穿越阶段性的热烈讨论，即使某一领域的研究正在力图作出认识论上的突破时，也是如此。,"Edwin Ardener noted (1985) that important concepts tend to go through periodic stages of hot debate, and they do so whenever a field of study is on the verge of a strong epistemological break."
5672,他指的概念是“理性”和他所预见的认识论上的割裂，这和人类学从宏大叙事的高度现代主义的时代突然转向马克思主义、结构-功能主义和结构主义是类似的。,"The concept about which he was speaking was ""rationality"", and the epistemological rupture that he foresaw was an abrupt shift away for anthropology from the high modernist era of the anthropological grand narratives of Marxism, structural-functionalism and structuralism."
5672,阿代纳的讨论发生在十多年前，我们为摆脱现代主义思维强有力的控制，力图从方法论、认识论、和政治上寻找出路时所遭遇的困惑，在今天关于文化概念上的论争中得到了很大程度上的延续。,"Ardener's discussion was over a decade ago, but the present-day controversy over the concept of culture is to a large extent a continuation of the same remarkably perplexing chore of extricating ourselves methodologically, epistemologically and politically from the powerful categories of modernist thought."
5673,功能主义和结构主义并不是截然分开的两个思想流派、有着不同的民族志描述的重点。,Functionalism and configurationalism are not so much separate schools of thought as different emphases that guide ethnographic description.
5673,英国传统的社会人类学，在展示亲属系统、巫术和魔术、仪式和神话、王位和首领制度运作方式的著作中，强调一种功能主义的描写说明。,"Social anthropology in Britain traditionally has emphasized a functionalist sort of description in masterful monographs that show the workings of kinship systems, of witchcraft and sorcery, ritual and myth, kingship and chieftainship."
5673,美国的文化人类学则稍微更多地强调结构主义方法。,Cultural anthropology in America has emphasized somewhat more the configurationalist approach.
5674,更为勇敢的是，里维尔（Riviera)对婚姻的分析概念提出了质疑。,Even more courageous for the times are Rivière's (1971) queries into the analytic concept of marriage.
5674,他反对所有对婚姻的法律定义，建议应首先从结构上来看待婚姻制度，将其看作众多潜在可能的男人和女人之间的关系的一种。,"He argues against any jural definition of marriage, and suggests instead that the institution of marriage be first viewed structurally, as one of many relationships conceived possible between men and women."
5674,人类学家正是将他对民族志作品的诠释定义为跨文化情形下的“婚姻”制度，实际上，这制度“除了都关注男人和女人的概念角色之外，没有什么其他共同特征”（同上：70)。,"It was his reading of the ethnographic literature that anthropologists had been defining institutions cross-culturally as ""marriage"" when said institutions in fact had ""no feature in common other than that they are concerned with the conceptual roles of male and female"" (ibid.: 70)."
5675,解放给了被解放的奴隶以政治、经济和社会自由，信仰转变给了他们在基督世界里的新生活，再生的可能性。传教士的圣地之梦依赖于有着新性别秩序的村落。,"Emancipation had given enslaved men and women their political, economic and social freedom.Conversion gave them a new life in Christ, the possibility to be born anew.The missionary dream of this new Jerusalem depended on new villages with a new gender order."
5675,村落被设计成小教堂和传教士的房子在中央，整齐的村舍环绕周围，真正的基督教家庭居于其中。,"The villages were designed with the chapel and mission-house at the centre, surrounded by neat cottages, occupied by proper Christian families."
5676,但在他那些解构的著作中，德里达超越了这些并进而关注批评得以产生的环境，关注什么是解释和话语的元层次。,"But Derrida goes beyond this in his work of deconstruction to focus on the circumstances in which criticism takes place, in what is a meta-level of explanation and discourse."
5676,首先，典型的批评都是通过关注概念的起源而不是现在的状态来解构它们的，原因在于当起源已经消失之时，起源的“痕迹”仍然明显。,"In the first place, criticism typically deconstructs concepts by focusing on their origins rather than just their present state, in such a way that the ""trace"" of the origin is always evident even after it has becomeabsent."
5676,但痕迹还作为起源的对立面而构成了起源，因为只有通过痕迹我们才能发现起源。,"But the trace also constitutes the origin as its opposite, since it is only through the trace that we discern the origin."
5677,最后，新世界可以“变形”的方式产生。,"And finally, new worlds can be made by way of ‘Deformation’."
5677,一个世界可以通过扭曲、减少或再说明一些元素得到更新，或者也可通过主题的变奏来实现。,"A world is renewed by distorting, reducing or elaborating upon, some of its elements, and by making variations on its themes."
5677,（通过再阐释权力和意识形态，每次互动、每个人都受到了影响，福柯对社会的解构使马克思主义的批判发生了形变；结果是每个核心的控制体系都破碎成拙劣模仿的副本、最终无法控制的瞬间。）,"(A Foucauldian deconstruction of society deforms the Marxian critique, for instance, by elaborating upon the themes of power and ideology to the extent that every interaction and every body is implicated; the result is that any overarching system of control fragments into a palimpsest of parodic, ultimately uncontrollable moments.)"
5678,出于论证的目的，我们将克利福德˙格尔兹的解释人类学与詹姆斯˙克利福德的文本主义的元人类学并置起来。,"For the sake of the argument, let us juxtapose Clifford Geertz's interpretive anthropology to James Clifford's textualist metaanthropology."
5678,如果格尔兹仍然寻求通过他对虚构化的场景的有限运用来捕捉和操纵那些在虚构化场景中才得以展现的异国情调，那么文本主义与解构主义的转向就会有这样的危险：即制造出更多更高明的关于其他文本的档案系统以及想象着世界上的其他人都在努力做着同样的事情。,"If Geertz is still seeking to conjure and capture the demons of exoticism—theater states, shadow plays, cock fights— through his limited use of fictionalized stagings in which they can appear to us, the textualist/deconstructive move runs the risk of inventing ever more clever filing systems for others' texts and of imagining that every one else in the world is hard at work doing the same thing."
5678,为了使讨论不致偏离方向，应当强调的是，我并不是想说，克利福徳的事业到目前为止进行得很不完善。,"Lest the argument run away in directions of its own, I should stress that I am not saying that Clifford's enterprise has up to the present been any thing but salutary."
5679,按照生物和文化进化来讲述人类的故事这一范型有许多优点。,"This paradigm, which tells the human story in terms of biological and cultural evolution, has many advantages."
5679,最大的优点是它的范围。,Its greatest one is its scope.
5679,它提供了一个框架，这个框架可以容纳最多样的数据和研究模式。,It provides a framework within which to fit the most diverse data and modes of research.
5679,干枯的头颃、陶器的破片和陌生的语言，从仅仅是满足一些人的好奇心，变成人类历史和文化模式的证据。,"Shrunken heads, potsherds, and exotic languages are removed from the status of mere curiosities and become evidence of human history and cultural pattern."
5680,然而，生命巨链和进化理论之间存在两个重要差异。,"However, there are two important differences between the Great Chain of Being and the theory of evolution."
5680,第一，“进化”概念既包含时间方面，也包含空间方面：事物随着时间变化或 进化。,"First, the concept ‘evolution’ has a temporal as well as a spatial aspect: things change or evolve through time."
5680,第二，生命巨链的经典概念是以物种不变性理念为基础的，与之相反，在其生物形式上，进化论则依赖于相反概念，即物种的可变性。,"Secondly, whereas the classic notion of the Great Chain of Being was based on the idea of the fixity of species, the theory of evolution, in its biological form, depends on the contrary notion of the mutability of species."
5680,低等形式进化为高等形式。,Lower forms evolve into higher forms.
5681,许多其他领域影响深远的作品也出现在德语国家中历史相对论在学术中占支配地位的这一初期阶段，包括宗教和法律领域的历史学家以及历史哲学家的作品。这些学者中没有人遵循主流的民族主义方向。,"A number of influential works from other fields emerged in these first phases of historicist academic dominance in the German-speaking countries.These were works by a few historians of religion and law and philosophers of history, none of whom followed the nationalist mainstream."
5681,他们一方面怀着历史学家的兴趣，转向了更广范围的、比较性的主题。这一兴趣反映着人文发展阶段的一些启蒙兴趣的痕迹。与此同时，他们也已吸取了对世界文化多样性的越来越多的洞察。,"On the contrary, they turned to wider, comparative issues with a historian's interest that still echoed some of the Enlightenment interest in the stages of humanity's development while already absorbing the growing number of insights into the world’s cultural diversity."
5681,这已经在许多方面预示着进化论在世界范围内的兴起。,This was already foreshadowing in rich ways the international rise of evolutionism.
5682,这方面的一个例子就是瑟维斯（Service)的进化潜力定律。,An example is Service's law of evolutionary potential.
5682,这一所谓的定律坚持认为，文化进化中的突破更有可能发生在文明的周围而不是中心。,This so-called law holds that breakthroughs in cultural evolution are more likely to occur at the periphery than at the center of a civilization.
5682,历史是一场接力赛：一个重要的群体携带交接棒跑到一个地方，然后把它传给一个处于边缘的群体，后者会在一段时间变成重要群体。,"History is a relay race: A central group carries the baton of civilization to a certain point, then hands it to a peripheral group that becomes, for a time, central."
5682,随着历史在地理上的曲折进行，最后的变成最先的，最先的则变成最后的。,"The last become first, then the first last,as history proceeds in a geographical zigzag."
5683,人们还没有提出对于乱伦禁忌真正令人信服的解释。,A truly convincing explanation of the incest taboo has yet to be advanced.
5683,当然，不断有建议表明，它可能是对于避免近亲繁殖的潜在倾向而在文化上苦心经营的结果。,"Certainly, there are persistent hints that it may be a cultural elaboration of an underlying biological tendency toward avoidance of inbreeding."
5683,对动物行为的研 究已轻证明，在比较太型、寿命长、成热慢、智力髙的种类中，这种倾向普遍存在。,"Studies of animal behavior have shown such a tendency to be common among relatively large, long-lived, slow-to-mature, and intelligent species."
5683,人类在各方面都有资格成为这一群的成员。,Humans qualify for membership in this group on all counts.
5683,大部分其他灵长目动物也一样包括与人类关系最密切的那些灵长目动物——狒狒和黑猩猩。,"So do a number of other primates, including those most closely related to humans—chimpanzees."
5683,尽管它们很少显示性抑制，但是这些类人猿的确倾向于避免在同胞兄弟姐妹之间以及在雌性与其雄性后代之间的近亲交配。,"Although they exhibit few sexual inhibitions, chimpanzees do rend to avoid inbreeding between siblings and between females and their male offspring."
5684,可是，为了实观事物的某种形式，为了给人、事物和事件设定某种秩序，就必须排斥或避开另一些人、事物和亊件；毎一个概念和信息的组织方式都体现了对其他潜在的秩序与意义的某种禁忌。,"To realize one pattern of things, however, to configure one order of people, things and events in the universe, is to exclude and eschew other ones; every concept and organization of information represents a type of taboo against other potential orderings and meanings."
5684,对于个体来说，认可某一识别体系，就意味着忽视其他个体可能采取的识别体系。,"For individuals to realize one set of identities, therefore, is to negate others those same individuals might have assumed."
5684,不仅如此，未来的认知内容会因现有的图式而具有某种路径依赖性。,"Not only that, existing schemata tend to act as canalizing devices for what is cognized in future."
5685,现在，实证主义和阐释观点在人类学和社会科学内都可以找到，伴随着各自大量的阴影和着色。,"Now, within anthropology and the social sciences are found both the positivist and the interpretive viewpoints, with myriad shadings and colorings of each."
5685,不过，简单来说，我们可以认为，实证主义在社会科学(心理学、社会学、经济学）中占据主导地位，阐释则在民族志中占有主导地位。,"Simplifying, however, we can identify the dominant viewpoint in the social sciences – psychology, sociology, economics – as positivist and an influential viewpoint in ethnography as interpretive."
5685,实证主义社会学家和阐释民族志学者之间一个有些被夸张的对比，有助于突出其各自特有的逻辑。,A somewhat overstated contrast between the positivist social scientist and the interpretive ethnographer serves to highlight the distinctive logic of each.
5686,然而，我们可以用较少种族中心主义的方式把家庭定义为：由一个女子和她扶养的孩子以及至少一个通过婚姻或血源关系加入的成年男子组成的群体。（非传统家庭的主题将在第九章讨论。,"We can, however, define the family in a less ethnocentric way as a group composed of a woman and her dependent children and at least one adult male joined through marriage or blood relationship."
5686,）纳亚尔人形成血缘家庭（consanguine），它由女子、她们扶养的子女以及女子的兄弟组成。,"The Nayar form a consanguine family, consisting as it does of women, their dependent offspring, and the women's brothers."
5686,在这种社会里，虽然男子与女子结婚，但并不作为一个家户的成员居住在一起。,"In such societies, men and women get married but do not live together as members of one household."
5686,相反，他们生活在他们从小长大的家户之中，男子与他们的妻子“交换”性活动。,"Rather, they spend their lives in the households they grew up in, with the men ""commuting"" for sexual activity with their wives."
5686,男女的经济合作发生在姐妹与兄弟之间而不是丈夫与妻子之间。,"Economic cooperation between men and women occurs between sisters and brothers, rather than husbands and wives."
5687,对印度的研究和列维-斯特劳斯的影响一样使得迪蒙转向了结构主义，因为他认为这种理论立场能够最好地解释他的印度材料 (Dumont 1986)。,"It was India as much as Lévi-Strauss that converted Dumont to structuralism, since he thought that this approach explained his Indian material best (see 1986)."
5687,但是在牛津做讲师的那四年的经历（1951—1955) 也让他直接接触到了英国的经验主义，在那里他取代了拉德克利夫-布朗学派的功能主义者M.斯利尼瓦（M.Shnivas)——他自己把这段在牛津的经历称为“第二次训练”。,"But he also had direct exposure to British empiricism through his four years as a lecturer in Oxford (1951–1955), where he replaced the Radcliffe-Brownian functionalist M. Srinivas — he referred to his Oxford experience as ""a second training."""
5687,后来迪蒙返回法国，并继续到印度的北部做田野工作，这次调查他显然不太满意，相关出版物也极少。,"Dumont then returned to France, then proceeded to India to undertake fieldwork in the north, with which he was apparentlyless satisfied and about which he published little."
5687,1957年他回到巴黎担任印度社会学教授，随后又在EPHE任比较社会学教授并在那里一直干到退休。在EPHE他和戴维˙波科克（David Pocock)—起创办了《印度社会学进展》这本重要的期刊，其目的在于把印度人类学从原来的各种民俗学的、进化论的和功能主义的老路上拉出来从而使其进入到结构主义的轨道上去，这项事业显然是以《社会学年鉴》为蓝本的。,"In 1957, now back in Paris with a chair in the sociology of India and later in comparative sociology at the EPHE, where he remained until he retired, he launched the important journal Contributions to Indian Sociology with David Pocock, the aim being to draw the anthropology of India away from its various folkloric, evolutionist, and functionalist origins and onto the path of structuralism, a venture obviously modeled on the Année sociologique."
5688,在拉德克利夫-布朗（例如Radcliffe-Brown 1931)的澳大利亚田野民族志中，他提倡比较观点，并以当时发现的土著社会结构的完整复合体来解释澳大利亚土著亲属体系的多样性。,"In his Australian ethnography, Radcliffe-Brown (e.g., 1931) advocated a comparative perspective and explained the diversity in Aboriginal kinship systems in terms of the full complex of Aboriginal social structure found at the time."
5688,作为推崇归纳法的学者，他相信有一天人类学可以通过比较发现“社会的自然法则”（虽然他自己并没有做太多研究）。,"An inductivist, he believed that anthropology would one day discover through comparison the ‘natural laws of society’ (though he himself did not get very far in the effort)."
5688,作为经验论者，他反对推测构成社会的体系或制度起源，并认为人类学家只应该研究他们所发现的那些东西。,"As an empiricist, he opposed speculation about the origins of the systems or institutions which make up society and argued that anthropologists should study just what they find."
5689,人们鼓励，或至少比依附训练成为惯例的社会更加容忍侵犯行为和性行为。,Displays of aggression and sexuality are encouraged or at least tolerated to a greater degree than where dependence training is the rule.
5689,在学校，甚至在家庭，人们都强调竞争。,"In schools, and even in the family, competition is emphasized."
5689,在美国，我们已走向极端，把婴儿期的生物学功能——吃、睡、哭叫、排泄——转变为父母与子女之间的竞争。,"In the United States, we have gone to the extreme of turning the biological functions of infancy—eating, sleeping, crying, and elimination 一into contests between parents and offspring."
5689,"在我们的学校，相当多的资源投入到了竞技运动，人们在教室之内也培养竞技：公开的形式,诸如拼单词比赛以及有奖竞赛等；隐蔽的形式，诸如按学生成绩分布曲线评级分类。","In our schools, considerable resources are devoted to competitive sports, but competition is fostered within the classroom as well: overtly, through devices such as spelling bees and competition for prizes, and covertly, through devices such as grading on a curve."
5690,夸扣特尔人被描述为恰好相反——作为酒神精神的一个例证。,Kwakiutl are described as the opposite – an example of a Dionysian culture.
5690,在宗教仪式上，领舞者进入深度迷乱状态。,In their religious ceremonies the chief dancer goes into deep trance.
5690,他口吐白沫，浑身剧烈颤抖。为安全起见，通常身上要绑四根绳子（分别由四个人拉住）。,"He foams at the mouth, trembles violently, and typically has to be tied up with four ropes (each held by a different person) to keep him from doing any damage."
5691,因此，婚后居住安排完全不是任意的，实际上是适应性的。,"A newly married couple may adopt one of five common patterns of residence whose prime determinants are ecological circumstances, although other factors enter in as well."
5691,一种选择是从父居（patrilocal residence）。这正是玛雅人采取的居处模式：妇女与其丈夫一起到她丈夫在其中长大的那个家户中居住。,"One option is patrilocal residence; as just described for the Maya, a woman goes to live with her husband in the household he grew up in."
5691,偏爱这种安排在于男性在维持生计中起主导地位的作用，尤其是如果他们拥有能够积累的财产，如果一夫多妻制是一种习俗，如果战事足以造成特别重要的男性之间的合作，如果存在一种由男性掌握权力的复杂的政治组织的时候。,"Favoring this arrangement are societies with a predominant role for men in subsistence, particularly if they own property that can be accumulated, if polygyny is customary, if warfare is prominent enough to make cooperation among men especially important, and if an elaborate political or ganization in which men wield authority exists."
5692,进一步说，需要认识到，有一些要求自决的情况已经超出了联合国或其他有组织的国际程序力所能及的范围。,"Furthermore, it is necessary to keep in mind that a number of other situations in which claims for self-determination have been put remain outside the reach of the UN or any other organised international process."
5692,有时，这些情况则不断以政治、军事冲突形式来拖延历史进程。,Sometimes these situations continue to be characterised for protracted historical periods by political and military conflict.
5692,毫无疑问，鉴于现实情况如此复杂多样，一贯为国际接受的关于自决的政治原理并不存在。,It is not surprising that in view of such diversity no coherent and internationally accepted political doctrine of self-determination exists.
5693,在所有分层社会或多或少都有流动。,Mobility is present to a greater or lesser extent in all stratified societies.
5693,开放的阶级社会是指人们在其中最容易流动的那些社会。,Open-class societies are those with the easiest mobility.
5693,然而，在大多数情况下，变动仅限于社会阶梯中向上或向下移动一级。,"In most cases, however, the move is limited to one rung up or down the social ladder."
5693,流动程度与下述因素有关，比如较高的教育，或者在社会中占支配地位的家庭组织类型。,The degree of mobility is related to the type of family organization that prevails in a society.
5693,在扩大家庭是常态的社会中，流动常常受到严格的限制。,"Where the extended family is the norm, mobility tends to be severely limited."
5693,独立的核心家庭则使流动变得更加容易。,The independent nuclear family provides an easier situation for mobility.
5694,这些不同的视角集合在一起导致了对许多经典民族志个案的重新评价，如丛林区的昆人（Kung)、夸扣特尔人和霍皮人（Hopi)，它容许我们重新思考一些已经成为关于人类本性和文化的常识的结论。,"The bringing together of these different perspectives has led to a reevaluation of several of the classic ethnographic cases, such as those of the Kung Bushmen, the Kwakiutl, and the Hopi, allowing us to rethink the conclusions that had become received knowledge about human nature and culture."
5694,例如，在亚马逊流域。,"Consider, for example, Amazonia."
5694,近期的考古学已经将此区域的史前记录向前扩展到1.2万年以前，它揭示出的早期社会的复杂性远远超出了之前的预期。这使得人们对认为这是一种拥有较低生产力的边缘环境的假设为基础的理论产生了怀疑（Roosevelt 1994)。,"Recent archaeology that has extended the prehistoric record back to twelve thousand years ago has revealed much greater early complexity than had been expected, casting doubt on theories based on the assumption that this was a marginal environment with low productive capacity (Roosevelt 1994)."
5694,同样地，通过采用民族史方法研究欧洲人的征服对亚马逊流域的人类组织在人口规模和生态学上的影响所得到的发现，使曾一度盛行的民族志分析受到了质疑，其主题从战争到神话涵盖甚广。,"Similarly, the uncovering through ethnohistory of the demographic and ecological impact of European conquest on human organization in Amazonia has called into question prevalent ethnographic analyses on topics from warfare to myth."
5694,这一系列的证据和这些解释模式被证明在理解复杂社会和当代社会时是有帮助的，相比于理解传统人类学所感兴趣的社会，对复杂社会和当代社会的理解才是现今文化人类学更为经常关注的焦点。,"This range of evidence and these modes of interpretation are proving as useful for understanding the complex and contemporary societies on which cultural anthropology is now more often focused,as for comprehending societies of traditional anthropological interest."
5695,这尤其符合于那些没有将其对象历史化的表述，它们在一种“民族志的当前”(事实上总是过去）描绘异域社会。,"This is especially true of representations that have not historicized their objects, portraying exotic societies in an ""ethnographic present"" (which is always, in fact, a past)."
5695,这种共时性的悬置有效地将他者文本化，在一种既不在时间的流动中，也不在同样暧昧不明、变动的历史的当前创造出一种真实感，这种真实感包括并定位了他者、民族志作者和读者。,"This synchronic suspension effectively textualizes the other, and gives the sense of a reality not in temporal flux, not in the same ambiguous, moving historical present that includes and situates the other, the ethnographer, and the reader."
5695,用约翰尼斯˙费边的话说：“异时的”表述已经弥漫在20世纪的科学民族志里，它们用罗萨尔多所反对的神话化方式鼓励寓言性的挪用。,"""Allochronic"" representations, to use Johannes Fabian's term, have been pervasive in twentieth-century scientific ethnography.They invite allegorical appropriations in the mythologizing mode Rosaldo repudiates."
5696,但他很快恢复了镇定，接着又召集主教们到楼上开会并对他们进行恐吓和威胁。,But he soon rallied sufficiently to bully the bishops whom he had summoned to attend upon him upstairs.
5696,众人告诉亨利，托马斯把他们申斥了一顿并且警告他们今后不得对他进行任何世俗的指控和审判。,They told him that Thomas had reprimanded them and forbidden them to judge him henceforth on any secular charge.
5696,亨利闻言大为恼怒，并说这是对克拉伦顿法令第11条的刻意违犯，因为这一条法令规定主教必须参加所有由国王受理和审判的案件，除非这些案件是暴力和凶杀的血案。,"Angrily, Henry replied that this was a clear violation of Article XI of the Constitutions of Clarendon, which bound the bishops to participate in all of the king's trials and judgments unless these involved the shedding of blood."
5697,奥马哈制(Omaha system，因内布拉斯加州奧马哈印第安人而得名），是与母系的克劳制相对应的父系系统。,The Omaha System (named for the Omaha Indians of Nebraska) is the patrilineal equivalent of the matrilineal Crow system.
5697,"因此，母亲及其姐妹共用一个称呼，父亲及其兄弟共 用一个称呼,而平表兄弟姐妹则与兄弟和姐妹共用另一个称呼（参见图10.9)。","Thus, a mother and his brother are merged under another, and parallel cousins are merged with brothers and sisters (Figure 10.9)."
5697,母亲一方的交表兄弟姐妹提高了一个辈分，而父亲一方的交表兄弟姐妹则等同于“自 我”的子女一辈。,"Cross cousins on the maternal side are raised a generation, while those on the paternal side are equated with ego5s children generation."
5697,"这样,一个父系世系群的女人为另一个父系世系群的男人所生的子女，就降低了一个辈分。","Thus, children born of women from one patrilineage for the men of another patrilineage are lowered by one generation."
5698,克利人与他们猎捕的动物属于一个单一的道德群体，其成员相互认可并互尽义务。,The extent to which the animals are really seen as choosing to give themselves is not entirely clear from the ethnography.
5698,克利人了解动物的需求和敏感性，在他们的日常活动中会将它们考虑在内。同样，动物也了解克利人的需求，像他们的亲属那样在他们需要帮助的时候满足他们的需求。克利猎手们会得到动物朋友的协助，他们与这些动物建立了长期的伙伴关系（1979:139—140）。,"Cree hunters go to considerable lengths to outwit their quarry (Scott1989:199), and some Cree myths present hunting as a struggle between hunter and animal (Tanner 1979:149)."
5698,礼物在人的社区（居所）和动物的领地(丛林）之间进行交换。,Hunting is also likened to a sexual relationship in which the hunter seduces the animal with charms and songs.
5698,动物将它们自己作为食物赠给克利人，克利人则以敬献烟草作为回报，从烟囱里飘出的袅袅炊烟将烧烤中的食物又带回了丛林（Tanner 1979:172— 174)。,Reluctant animals may be tricked into giving themselves up against their will (Bird-David 1993:113).
5698,克利人向动物尽义务时，肉的分配以及对动物不可食用 部分的处理起着重要作用（Scott 1989:203—204)。,"On the other hand, a hunter who has no success should not be too disappointed, because ""it is wrong to expect more than is offered freely by a partner in reciprocity"" (Scott 1989:204), and the reciprocal nature of the relationship is stressed repeatedly in Tanner's description."
5699,刻板印象也可以发挥自我实现的预言的功能。,Stereotypes may also function as self-fulfilling prophecies.
5699,例如，一个优势群体在学校里可能会因为宣称劣势群体天生愚蠢的系统攻击而将他们变成学校的劣等生。,"A dominating group may, for example, turn a dominated group into school dunces by systematically bombarding them with statements to the effect that they are born stupid."
5699,也有许多刻板印象与社会事实没有明确的关系。,There are also many stereotypes with no clear relationship to social facts.
5699,在许多社会对食人族的控告就是典型的例子：它们通常都是错误的（Arens 1978)。,Accusations about cannibalism in many societies are typical examples: they are usually false (Arens 1978).
5699,刻板印象为种族边界提供了意识形态的合法化（不要与他们中的人结婚！）并加强了群体内聚力（我们都不喜欢他们是一件好事）。,"Stereotypes provide ideological legitimation of ethnic boundaries (""Don't marry one of those!"") and strengthen group cohesion (""It's a good thing we're not like them"")."
5700,“当地人的观点”是主位，而人类学家的分析视角是客位。,"The ""native's point of view"" is emic, whereas the analytical perspective of the anthropologist is etic."
5700,但是， 尽管人类学家的目标是用受访者的感知方式重现现实，却有三个理由可以说明这种结果不可能成为一种主位描述。,"However, even if the anthropologist aims to reproduce reality the way it is perceived by the informants, there are three reasons why the result may never be an emic description."
5700,首先，我们必须经常在两种不同的语言之间进行翻译，而翻译与原样是有区别的。,"First, we must usually translate between two different languages, and the translation is different from the original."
5700,第二，我们使用书写作为复制口述段落的工具，而当它们被转化成书面文字的时候，言语的意义有了改变。,"Second, we use a written medium to reproduce oral statements, and the meaning of utterances changes when they are transformed into writing."
5700,第三，人类学家永远不可能与他或她所描写的人一模一样。,"Third, the anthropologist can never become identical with the people he or she writes about."
5700,因此，唯一真正可能的人类学主位描述只能是由他们本国人用母语所写。,The only truly emic descriptions possible in anthropology are therefore accounts written by natives in their vernacular.
5701,科学活动必须使自身适应于现实的结构。它必须具有足够锐利的工具和极有条理的方法，才能有效地把握现实，使之为我们所理解。,Scicncing must adapt itself to the structure of reality; its tools must be so shaped and its techniques so ordered as to grasp reality effectively and render it intelligible to us.
5701,因此，这就意味着我们将有三种从事科学活动的方式。一种是从整体上领会现实界空间一时间属性的方式，两种属于辅助和派生的方式，分别探讨这一属性的两个侧面之一，即空间和时间。,"This means, therefore, that we shall have three ways of sciencing: one which grasps the space-time property of reality in its entirety, and two subsidiary and derivative ways, each of which deals with one of the two aspects of this property, viz., space and time."
5701,人们会发现，全部“科学”或科学活动，都可以被这样那样地归入这三个范畴之中.除这三者之外，再无其它的科学活动方式了。,"All of ""science"" or sciencing will be found to be assignable to one or another of these three categories; there is no way of sciencing apart from these three."
5702,大多数口号希望达到的效果是劝说，特別是说服讲演者的听众——虽然讲演者往往发现自己也会被自己的言语说服——这一点在政治领域或许十分常见。,"The effect which rhetoric most often intends is persuasion, in particular the persuasion of an audience by a speaker—although a speaker might also be found to be persuaded by his own voicing of his words—and this is perhaps most clearly seen in the realm of politics."
5702,口号可以看作是讲演者的手段，用来获得或加强对政治环境的控制。,Rhetoric can be seen as an instrument by which a speaker gains or increases control over a political environment.
5702,一旦这种控制规范化、制度化，那么控制语言、控制发言权就成为权力和权威的核心基础。,"And once this control becomes routinized, institutionalized, then control over language, over the right to speak, may be defined as an essential base of power and authority."
5703,叙事似乎是最容易记录和搜集的一种口头艺术。,Narratives seem to be one of the easiest kinds of verbal arts to record or collect.
5703,也许因为它们也是最适于公开发行的一种口头艺术而且在北美文化中最受欢迎，所以它们得到大量研究和关注。,"Perhaps because they also are the most publishable, with popular appeal in North American culture, they have received the most study and attention."
5703,一般而言，叙事分为三个基本的再出现的类别：神话，传奇和故事。,"Generally, narratives have been divided into three basic and recurring categories: myth, legend, and tale."
5704,此外，他们还会毁灭贵重物品：将咸鱼扔掉并焚烧帐篷和地毯。博厄斯大约在世纪之交的时候写道，往昔岁月，他们甚至会将奴隶们扔进大海以夸耀他们的财富。,"In addition, they destroyed valuables, throwing salt fish away and setting fire to tents and carpets; in the old days, Boas wrote around the turn of the century, they even threw slaves into the sea to show off their wealth."
5704,在接下来举行的另一场盛会上，首领主人在毁灭能力上将会超越前一位主人。,"At the return party, the hosting chief would have to surpass the previous host in destructive capabilities."
5704,能够毁掉最多财物的那位首领，将会在地区的等级制度中获得最髙的级别。,"The chief who could afford to destroy most, achieved the highest rank in the regional hierarchy."
5704,类似于夸富宴的其他制度也在许多别的民族中存在。,Institutions similar to the potlatch exist among many other peoples.
5704,浪费的目的是为了建立一种自己居于顶点的政治等级制度。,The purpose of the waste is to establish a political hierarchy with oneself on top.
5704,莫斯（Mauss 1954）在法国习俗中识别出了一种类似于夸富宴的温和形式，那里的人们试图通过赠送奢侈的结婚礼物而超越其他人。,Mauss (1954) has identified a milder form of potlatch in the French custom of trying to surpass others by giving lavish wedding presents.
5704,莫斯将夸富宴制度描述成是更普遍的互惠现象的一种“扭曲的”形式，而在许多社会中，互惠是一种重要的社会制度。,"Mauss describes the potlatch institution as a ""perverted"" form of the more widespread phenomenon of reciprocity, which is an important social institution in many societies."
5705,跨国公司在世界并非什么新事物（17世纪的荷属东印度公司就是一个很好的例子），但它们只是在20世纪后半期才变得普遍起来。,"Multinational corporations are not new in the world (the Dutch East India Company is a good example from the 17th century), but they were not common until the 1950s."
5705,现在，它们已经成为世界上的一支重要力址。,Since then they have become a major force in the world.
5705,这些现代巨人实际上是多个不同国籍的公司组成的集团，它们依靠共同的所有权这根纽带联结起来，并对共同经营策略负责。,These modern-day giants are actually clusters of corporations of diverse nationality joined together by ties of common ownership and responsive to a common management strategy.
5705,通常，这些跨国公司都受位于某国的总公司的严密控制，它们跨越不同国家的国界组织和整合生产，这种生产是服务于在公司董事会会议室里达成的利益，而不管这些利益与这些公司所在国人民的利益是否一致。,"Usually tightly controlled by a head office in one country, these multinationals organize and integrate production across the boundaries of different countries for interests formulated in corporate boardrooms, irrespective of whether or not these are consistent with the interests of people in the countries where they operate."
5706,危地马拉和墨西哥南部的玛雅人也生活在扩大家庭中。,The Maya of Guatemala and southern Mexico also live in extended family households.
5706,在他们的许多社区中，父亲的房屋建在一小块空场地的一边，而儿子则带着他们的妻子住在这块场地其他边缘的房屋中（参见图9）。,"In many of their communities, sons bring their wives to live in houses built on the edges of a small open plaza, where on one edge their father's house already stands (Figure 9.2)."
5706,许多家庭活动就在这片场地上进行，妇女们可以在这里编织，男人们可以在这里招待客人，孩子们则在一起玩耍。,"Numerous household activities occur on this plaza; here women may weave, men may receive guests, and children play together."
5706,父亲是一家之主，大多数的重要决定都由他做出。,"The head of the family is the sons's father, who makes most of the important decisions."
5706,家庭所有成员为了共同的利益一起工作，并作为一个整体与外人打交道。,Ail family members work together for the common good and deal with outsiders as a single unit.
5707,图腾制理论中还有西格蒙德•弗洛伊德（Freud 1960 [1913]:140 -55各处）的解释。,Interesting among theories of totemism is that of Sigmund Freud (1960 [1913]: 140–55 passim).
5707,虽然其理论基本上属于拉马克式，但弗洛伊德在达尔文观点和神学家威廉•罗伯逊•史密斯的思想基础上建立了他的理论。,"Though essentially a Lamarckian, he built his theory on the ideas of Darwin and also of theologian William Robertson Smith."
5707,弗洛伊德试图同时解释的是图腾制度的起源、祭祀和乱伦禁忌这些所有问题。,
5707,,"What he sought to explain was no less than the origin of totemism, sacrifice, and the incest taboo all at once."
5708,在1848年革命失败之前以及之后的一段时间，浪漫主义和民族主义双重浪潮都是影响广泛和异质的运动，包含了差不多一样多的知识分子、工人和商人；这两个运动既有左翼也有右翼。,"Before and for some time after the failed 1848 revolution, the twin currents of Romanticism and nationalism were broad, heterogeneous movements that comprised intellectuals as much as workers and businesspeople;they were movements with both left and right wings."
5708,民族主义和浪漫主义都倾向于把新的重心放在本国农村地区。,Nationalism and Romanticism both favored a new focus on rural homelands.
5708,浪漫主义崇尚拥抱乡间生活，因为它在寻求田园诗般和谐的审美境界，这些美学价值观后来对民族主义新政治运动产生了标准化影响。,"Romanticism embraced the domestic countryside because of its search for a retreat into the aesthetics of idyllic harmony.In turn, these new aesthetic values had a standardizing impact upon the new political movements of nationalism."
5708,正如汉娜·阿伦特（Hannah Arendt)指出的，在德语国家以及大多数中北欧地区中，民族主义对理想生活的浪漫主义想象被看作是一种向国家所宣称的农村根基的回归 (Arendt 1958)。,"As Hannah Arendt pointed out, the ideal life in the Romantic imaginary of nationalism in the German-speaking countries,as much as in most of Central and Northern Europe, was perceived as a return to a natio's alleged rural roots (Arendt 1958)."
5709,大多数村民都是亲戚，他们实行的婚姻制度是我们所称做的双边交表婚（参见第八章），意思是一个年轻女性必须与一个男人结婚，而这个男人必须是她母亲的兄弟的儿子同时也是她父亲的姐妹的儿子。,"Most of the inhabitants are relatives.They practise a system of marriage that we would call bilateral cross-cousin marriage (see Chapter 8), which means that a young woman must marry a man who is recognised as her mother's brother's son and her father's sister's son."
5709,他们的亲属称谓是分类的，也就是说，他们使用亲属称呼描述整个类别的人群，从生物意义上说，这些人并不一定有关系（参见第七章和第十一章）。,"Their kin terminology is classificatory; in other words, they use kin terms to describe whole categories of persons whom they are not necessarily biologically related to (see Chapters 7 and 11)."
5709,比起多贡人，雅诺马马人的劳动分工相对简单一些，大致是按照性别和年龄进行分工。,The Yanomamö have a less complex division of labour than the Dogon; it generally follows gender and age.
5709,最年幼的和最年长的有权不参加劳动，女人主要负责农活，只有男人外出打猎。,"The youngest and the oldest are entitled not to work, while the women are mainly responsible for agricultural activities, and only the men go hunting."
5709,村子的首领和巫师是村子里的最高权威。,The village headman and the shaman are the highest authorities in the villages.
5709,这些职务都不是世袭的；他们要通过出色的人品和与他人对权力的角逐才能获得。,Neither of these offices is hereditary; they are achieved through outstanding personal qualities and through successfully competing for power with others.
5710,他们的亲属称谓是分类的，也就是说，他们使用亲属称呼描述整个类别的人群，从生物意义上说，这些人并不一定有关系（参见第七章和第十一章）。,"Their kin terminology is classificatory; in other words, they use kin terms to describe whole categories of persons whom they are not necessarily biologically related to (see Chapters 7 and 11)."
5710,比起多贡人，雅诺马马人的劳动分工相对简单一些，大致是按照性别和年龄进行分工。,The Yanomamö have a less complex division of labour than the Dogon; it generally follows gender and age.
5710,最年幼的和最年长的有权不参加劳动，女人主要负责农活，只有男人外出打猎。,"The youngest and the oldest are entitled not to work, while the women are mainly responsible for agricultural activities, and only the men go hunting."
5710,村子的首领和巫师是村子里的最高权威。,The village headman and the shaman are the highest authorities in the villages.
5710,这些职务都不是世袭的；他们要通过出色的人品和在与他人对权力的角逐中获胜才能获得。,Neither of these offices is hereditary; they are achieved through outstanding personal qualities and through successfully competing for power with others.
5711,核心家庭是现代社会中的一种重要制度，而且在许多这样的社会中，亲属制度对于个人的职业机会、政治归属、居住地点等等而言，都是决定性的。,"The nuclear family is an important institution in modern societies, and in many such communities kinship is decisive for one's career opportunities, political belonging, place of residence and more."
5711,但在资本劳动力市场，表面上是基于正式的自愿契约和个人成就——而不是亲属制度义务和所属的身份。,"The capitalist labour market, however, is ostensibly based on formally voluntary contracts and individual achievement – not on kinship commitments and ascribed identity."
5711,因此，习惯上把基于家族的组织当做一种与官僚组织的对比，并且可能也是一种威胁，后者是现代社会中的劳动力市场和政治管理系统的特征。,"It is therefore customary to regard the kin-based organisation as a contrast, and possible threat, to the bureaucratic organisation characteristic of both the labour market and the system of political administration in modern state societies."
5711,基于家族的组织的基础是对特定个人的忠诚，而官僚组织理想的基础是对抽象原则的忠诚，特别是法律和契约职责。,"Kin-based organisation is based on loyalty to specific persons, while bureaucratic organisation ideally is based on loyalty to abstract principles, notably the law and contractual obligations."
5711,同族可能有互相帮助的义务，而官僚主义者必须使自己面对不同的人时都遵从同一程序和原则。,"Kinsmen may be obliged to help each other out, whereas bureaucrats have committed themselves to following identical procedures and principles no matter who they are dealing with."
5712,例如，从这些项目中得到的数据，可以使体质人类学家更好地理解哪些DNA控制哪些体质特点，以及我们早期的祖先怎样适应他们所处的自然环境。,"For example, the data available in these projects will allow physical anthropologists to better understand which DNA controls which physical features and how our early ancestors adapted to their physical environments."
5712,它也将会使得我们更加充分地了解我们自身及与我们最接近的非人类灵长类动物共享的进化历史。,It will also allow us to more fully understand the evolutionary history we share with our closest nonhuman primate relatives.
5712,最后，它将会提供给学者关于体质多样性的其他标志，超越以前所依赖的血型或肤色。,"Finally, it will give scholars other indicators of physical variation than those on which they have relied in the past, such as blood type or skin color."
5713,他提到的最著名的例子之一是巴黎咖啡馆的侍者，是如何谨慎而专业地努力发散出“身为侍者”的味道：依靠他的凝视、他的手势以及在他走动时平衡装满饮料的托盘的优雅姿态，以一种看似冷淡的方式、穿过厨房的门，他清楚地表达了作为侍者应该如何。,"One of his most famous examples is the waiter at a Parisian cafe, who cautiously and professionally tries to exude ""waiterness"".By virtue of his gaze, his gestures and his elegant way of balancing a full tray of drinks while he swings, in a seemingly nonchalant way, through the kitchen doors, he gives a clear expression of being a waiter."
5713,但是，如果他在家也以这种角色对待他的妻子，过不了多久，她大概就会提出离婚。萨特在其对角色扮演的哲学描述中，提出了一个此后一直被众多社会学家和人类学家所追随的话题：他们关心行动者操控身份以及因此而解放自己的能力——并非同样地是从身份中，而是从某些身份似乎包含的明显的强制中。,"However, if he were to maintain this role at home with his wife, she would presumably file for a divorce within a few weeks.In his philosophical descriptions of role enactment, Sartre brings up a topic which has since been pursued by many sociologists and anthropologists.They have focused on the ability of actors to manipulate their statuses and thereby liberate themselves – not from the statuses as such, but from the apparent coercion certain statuses seem to imply."
5714,韦伯借鉴了齐美尔的观点，乍一看，他比后者更加形式主义。,"Weber borrowed from Simmel and, at first glance, he was the more formalist of the two."
5714,韦伯发展了反经验主义的“理想类型”（idea types)这一概念，是指我们对于事物如何发挥作用的想象理解。,He developed the anti-empiricist notion of ‘ideal types’ – our imagined understandings of how things work.
5714,他认为，要想理解社会学体系中的个别事件，进行想象理解是必需的。,He argued that these are necessary in order to comprehend individual events in a social system.
5715,第二，人类学家都力图避免陷入当地理性观念的重置语境，这会使他们的资料显得“杂乱”。不合逻辑或冲突矛盾或许证实的是另一种与西方观念不同的逻辑和途径。,"Secondly, anthropologists have sought to avoid a recontextualization of local notions of rationality; what appears ""chaotic"" in their data, illogical and contradictory, may well evidence an alien logic and way of ordering matterwhich does not accord with Western notions."
5715,"关于理性的讨论中（Wilson l970；Hollis and Lukes 19821；Overing 1985a),人类学家一直在探索可以使自己的资料避免受到经验性合理条件和西方正统逻辑规则干扰的方法。","In debates over rationality, therefore (Wilson 1970; Hollis and Lukes 1982; Overing 1985a), anthropologists have sought ways of avoiding construing their data via the empirically based truth conditions and formal rules of logic of the West."
5716,前者于1940年出版，与关于这同一民族的其他两部书和多篇文章一起，长期以来一直被认为是典范性的民族志著作。,"The former, published in 1940, has long been recognized, along with two other books and various articles on the same people, as an exemplary ethnographic work."
5716,后者于1975年出版，由一个著名的法国社会史学家撰写，由于它被认为创造性地利用一种审讯记录以构建一个14世纪法国村庄的“民族志”分析，已经获得了广泛的赞誉。,"The latter, published in 1975 by a noted French social historian, has received wide acclaim for its innovative use of an inquisition register to construct an ""ethnographic"" analysis of a fourteenth-century French village."
5716,勒华拉杜里的这种介入与其他关于历史学和人类学的实验性著作一起被称颂为开创了这样的可能性：让历史学更具有民族志特性和让民族志更具有历史性。,"Le Roy Ladurie's intervention, among other experimental works of history and anthropology, has been hailed as opening the possibility of a more ethnographic history and a more historical ethnography."
5717,如果从建立机构的数量上比较，历史人类学在1989年之前的一个10年中仍然比社会人类学强大，而今天则反过来了：社会人类学成为德语国家现在的主流趋势。,"If compared quantitatively according to the number of institutional positions, historical anthropology was still stronger than social anthropology in the pre-1989 decade, whereas today the reverse is true: social anthropology has become a mainstream tendency in the German-speaking countries of the present."
5717,在1989年之前很早的时候，当社会人类学者接手了苏黎世、维也纳和西柏林的三个最大的大学院系的时候，这一缓慢的转变已经显露出来并被预见了。,"This gradual transformation already was indicated and anticipated when, long before 1989, social anthropologists took over the three largest university departments in Zürich, Vienna, and West Berlin."
5717,当民族社会学通常还是一个德语术语之时，社会人类学也已对经济和宗教主题给予了应有的关注。,"While Ethnosoziologieoften continued to be the German term, social anthropology has also included due attention to economic and religious topics."
5717,此外，许多身为历史人类学家 (如施勒希尔、约翰逊和杰特马）的有影响的学者自己也在某种程度上从事社会人类学研究，并在他们的学生中推广。,"In addition, a number of influential scholars who are primarily historical anthropologists (Schlesier, Johansen, Jettmar) also pursued social anthropology to some extent themselves and promoted it among their students."
5718,连续一夫一妻制是一个男子或一个女子与一系列配偶结婚的婚姻形式。,
5718,最近数十年中，由于离婚和再婚，这种形式在北美中产阶级中越来越普遍。,
5718,然而，在妇女做大量生产性工作的社会中，一夫多妻制可作为一种手段，为家户增添财富。,"Yet in societies where women do most of the productive work, polygyny may serve as a means of generating wealth for a household."
5718,尽管在特定社会极少数婚姻是一夫多妻的，但人们也认为它是恰当的婚姻形式，在世界大多数社会，它甚至还是人们优先选择的婚姻形式。,"Although few marriages in a given society may be polygynous, it is regarded as an appropriate, and even preferred, form of marriage in the majority of the world's societies."
5718,因为有剩余男子的社区不多，所以一妻多夫制，即妇女有几个丈夫的习俗是不常见的。,"Since few communities have a surplus of men, polyandry, or the custom of a woman having several husbands, is uncommon."
5718,几个男人与几个女人相互有性接触权的群婚也是罕见的。,"Also rare is group marriage, in which several men and several women have sexual access to one another."
5718,夫兄弟婚通过规定寡妇与她已故丈夫的兄弟结婚来为妇女提供保障，妻姐妹婚规定鳏夫与他已故妻子的姐妹结婚。,"The levirate ensures the security of a woman by providing that a widow marry her husband's brother; the sororate provides that a widower marry his wife's sister.Serial monogamy is a form in which a man or woman marries a series of partners* In recent decades, this pattern has become increasingly common among middle-class North Americans as individuals divorce and remarry."
5719,对打破乱伦禁忌者的惩罚并非都是严厉的；但是，直系亲属之间的婚姻一直都是被严格禁止的。乱伦禁忌为什么是普遍的？,"Sanctions against violations of the incest taboo are not universally strong; however, marriage between close kin is always strictly prohibited.Why is the incest taboo universal?"
5719,从泰勒和弗洛伊德的时代以来，提出了各种解释方案。,"Since the time of Tylor and Freud, several explanations have been put forward."
5719,一些人类学家指出，规则的社会优势包括：通过吸收新成员和跨越家族边界铸造联盟，使群体得以扩张（参见第八章）。,"Several anthropologists have pointed out the social advantages of the rule, including the expansion of the group through the inclusion of new members and the forging of alliances across kin boundaries (see Chapter 8)."
5720,与世系群不同，氏族的居住地往往是分散的而非集中于某地。,"Unlike lineages, clan residence is usually dispersed rather than localized."
5720,在缺少居处统一性的情况下，氏族的身份认同往往通过图腾得到强化。图腾通常是自然界的符号化，它能够提醒成员他们拥有一个共同的祖先。,"In the absence of residential unity, clan identification is often reinforced by totems, usually symbols from nature that remind members of their common ancestry."
5720,联族或半偶族是一个包含两三个氐族的单系继嗣群体，这些氐族被认为拥有共同的血统。,A phratry is a unilineal descent group of two or more clans that supposedly share a common ancestry.
5720,如果一个社会只有两个这样的群体，它们就被称作半偶族。,"If there are but two such groups, they are called moieties."
5721,或许除了作为个人的深层的东西之外，良知还是人体构造中比血管之类更为重要的构成部件。,"Except, perhaps, that conscience seems deeper within one, a more intimate part of one's make-up, than semi-circular canals."
5721,血管只是一种机械手段，而良知则是人类本身、人的自我的组成部分。,"After all, these canals are merely a mechanical device, whereas a conscience is an integral part of one's self, one's ego."
5721,然而，由于全部判断都是在直接经验的基础上作出的，我们仍然可能为幻觉所欺骗，而这正是目前这个实例中所出现的状况。,"Yet, for all the conviction that immediate experience carries, we can still be tricked by illusion.And this is exactly what has happened in the present instance."
5722,在沿缅因州海岸线的半岛和岛屿上曾实行这种居处模式。在那里，正如前面提到过的，扩大家庭的家户是建立在两可居基础上的。,"This was once the situation on the peninsulas and islands along the Maine coast, where, as already noted, extended family households were based upon ambilocal residence."
5722,这种居处模式在以寻食为生的民族当中特别普遍。例如，非洲依图利森林中的姆布蒂人就采取这种居处模式。,"The same residential pattern is particularly common among food-foraging peoples, as among the Mbuti of Africa's Ituri forest."
5723,裂变是指一个大的世系群分裂成新的小世系群，而原先的那个世系群则成为氏族。,"Fission is the Small Places， Large Issuestting up of a large lineage group into new, smaller ones, with the original lineage becoming a clan."
5723,氏族成员宣称他们源自同一个袓先，但却并不确切地知道与那个袓先的系谱联系。,Clan members claim descent from a common ancestor but without actually knowing the genealogical links to that ancestor.
5723,与世系群不同氏族的居住地往往是分散的而非集中于某地。,"Unlike lineages, clan residence is usually dispersed rather than localized."
5723,"在缺少居处统一性的情况下，氏族的身份认同往往通过图腾得到强化。图腾通常是自然界的符号化,它能够提醒成员他们拥有一个共同的祖先。","In the absence of residential unity, clan identification is often reinforced by totems, usually symbols from nature that remind members of their common ancestry."
5723,联族或半偶族是一个包含两三个氏族的单系继嗣群体，这些氏族被认为拥有共同的血统。,A phratry is a unilineal descent group of two or more clans that supposedly share a common ancestry.
5723,如果一个社会只有两个这样的群体，它们就被称作半偶族。,"If there are but two such groups, they are called moieties."
5724,虽说亚历山大（Alexander)用快刀斩乱麻的方式砍断了“戈耳狄俄斯之结”但却未能解开它。,But Alexander merely cut the Gordian knot; he did not untie it.
5724,我们也没有“解决”这一精神-肉体问题，因为在人类的反应话动受到困扰的形式中，是不可能解决这个问题的。,"Neither have we ""solved"" the mind-body problem, for in the form in which it has plagued the reflecting portion of mankind, it is insoluble."
5724,但是我们已经找到了对付它的办法。,But we have disposed of it.
5724,我们并没有证明，而且也不可能证明不存在宇宙实体或独立于肉体的精神。,"We have not proved, nor can it be proved, that there is no cosmic entity, mind, which has an existence independent of bodies."
5725,这些财产每一代由一名男性首领或其他男性头领控制，他继承了这些权利和义务，但因为继嗣只通过女性追溯，所以一个男性无法从他的父亲那里继承这些东西。这样，首领位置的继承是由一个男性传给他外甥的。,"These properties are controlled each generation by a male chief or other leader who inherits these rights and obligations, but because descent is traced exclusively through women, a man cannot inherit these from his father.Thus, succession to positions of leadership passes from a man to his sister?s son."
5725,由于这个原因，一个按常规管理其继嗣群体财产的男性，将带着他的妻子与他继承的那个人——他的舅舅生活在一起。,"For this reason, a man who is in line to take control of his descent group5s assets will take his wife to live with the one he will succeed—his mother's brother."
5725,这使他能够观察他怎样管理小村庄的事务，还能学会口述传统和巫术——他需要这些东西来成为一个有效的首领。,"This enables him to observe how the older man takes care of his hamlet's affairs, as well as to learn the oral traditions and magic he will need to be an effective leader."
5726,我们应该注意到，这种社会流动性并没有就这样挑战了种姓等级制度：相反，它公开地支持了它。,"This kind of social mobility, we should note, does not challenge the caste hierarchy as such: rather, it openly endorses it."
5726,这种被称为种姓冲突的政治冲突是一种不同的类型。,The type of political conflict spoken of as caste conflict is of a different kind.
5726,潘（Pan）这个种姓是低级的、仪式上肮脏的和贫穷的种姓，其首领为甘地的种姓平等的观念所激励。,"The Pan caste was a lowly, ritually polluting and poor caste whose leaders were inspired by Gandhi's notions of caste equality."
5726,在一些场合，他们试图进入只为高级种姓服务的庙宇，但却被驱逐出来。,"On several occasions they had tried to enter a temple reserved for the high castes, but had been evicted."
5726,于是他们建造了自己的庙宇，并宣布他们自己是一个干净的种姓。,They then built their own temple and declared themselves a clean caste.
5726,这个策略并没有被比斯帕拉的其他种姓所接受，他们将其看成是对规则的公然违背，而这无助于提高潘这个种姓被社会所定义的等级。,"This strategy was not accepted by the other castes in Bisipara, who saw it at a blatant breach of rules, and it did not help in improving the socially defined rank of the Pan caste."
5726,对于潘这个种姓来说，由于经济原因，采取制酒者的那种策略也是不可行的。,"To the Pan caste, the strategy followed by the distillers was not feasible for economic reasons."
5726,于是他们中的部分人开始采取第三种行动路线，试图通过竞争性的价值层次来提高他们的等级，也就是公共服务。,"Thus some of them began to follow a third course of action, trying to improve their rank through a rivalling value hierarchy, namely the public service."
5727,从人类学的观点来看，这需要进行经验主义的研究。,"From an anthropological point of view, this needs to be studied empirically."
5727,阿帕杜莱 （Appadurai 1990）因而提出了一个探究当代世界文化流动的研究框架。,Appadurai (1990) has thus proposed a framework for exploring cultural flow in the contemporary world.
5727,他区分了全球文化流动的五种维度，它们发挥作用的方式各不相同。,"He distinguishes between five dimensions in global cultural flow, which have different ways of functioning."
5727,种族景观（the ethnoscape）如指“形成了我们生活在其中的易变的世界的那些人的景观”，也就是，世界人口统计学的特征——旅游、移居、流亡、差旅，还有那些稳定的社区。,"The ethnoscape refers to ""the landscape of persons who constitute the shifting world in which we live""; in other words, the demographic attributes of the world – tourism, migration, exile, business travel, but also stable communities."
5727,科技景观（the	techoscape）的意思是“全球的……科技的……构造”，它在重要的方面形成了文化流的意义，也包括了参差不齐的全球的科技分布。,"The technoscape means the ""global configuration … of technology"", which in important ways shapes the flow of cultural meaning, and also includes the uneven global distribution of technology."
5728,长期以来一直令人类学家以及人类行为的其他研究者着迷的文化规则是乱伦禁忌（incest taboo）。,A cultural rule that long has fascinated anthropologists as well as other students of human behavior is the incest taboo.
5728,这种乱伧禁忌至少在父母与相反性别的孩子之间，通常也在同胞兄弟姐妹之间禁止有性关系。,This prohibits sexual relations at least between parents and children of opposite sex and usually siblings as well.
5728,除了涉及同胞兄弟姐妹的几个例外，乱伦禁忌曾被认为是普遍的，这在某种程度上变成对人类学家的挑战：既要解释乱伦禁忌被信以为真的普遍性，也要解释乱伦一般被视为那样令人厌恶的行为的原因。,"Once thought to be universal, save for a few exceptions involving siblings, the taboo has became something of a challenge for anthropologists to explain, both regarding this supposed universality and why incest commonly should be regarded as such loathsome behavior."
5728,人们已经给出许多解释。,Many explanations have been given.
5728,其中，在不同时期有点流行的、最简单和最不令人满意的解释以“人的本性”为根据，即人类对乱伦有某种本能的厌恶。,"Of those that have gained some popularity at one time or another, the simplest and least satisfactory is based on ""human nature""一that is, some instinctive horror of incest."
5729,世界各地的许多部族社会都规定或更喜欢男性与他母亲的兄弟的女儿结婚。,Many tribal societies throughout the world prescribe or prefer that the male marry the daughter of his mother's brother.
5729,不过，同样是在这些社会，却又禁止生物学上关系非常紧密的表亲婚姻，像父亲的兄弟的儿子与母亲的姐妹的女儿之间的婚姻。,"Yet these same societies forbid the marriage of cousins who are biologically just as close, that is, parallel cousins where the linking relative is the same sex as the parent, as in father's brother's son and mother's sister's daughter."
5729,这一风俗的原因太过复杂，以至于不能在这里援引；其要点是，虽然乱伦禁忌可能很普遍或广泛存在，但是具体的禁忌则是变化多样。,"The reasons for this custom are too complex to cite here; the point is that, although the incest taboo may be universal or widespread, the specific prohibition varies."
5730,进一步，在这种方式下，科学的理解仍然是相当客现的，这只不过是因为我们运用的推理风格决定了客观性的尺度……需要通过推理才能证明的那一类命题，只是因为推理的风格才具有了一种实在性，才可能被判断为真或伪”（第49，65页）。,"Furthermore, science understood in this way remains quite objective ""simply because the styles of reasoning that we employ determine what counts as objectivity....Propositions of the sort that necessarily require reasoning to be substantiated have a positivity, a being true or false, only in consequence of the styles of reasoning in which they occur"" (49, 65)."
5730,福柯所谓的真理与谬误的统治，或者游戏，既是历史实践的组成部分，又是它的产物。,"What Foucault has called the regime, or game, of truth and falsity is both a component and a product of historical practices."
5730,其他的程序和对象同样有可能合乎它的标准。,
5730,,Other procedures and other objects could have filled the bill just as well and have been just as true.
5731,个体在观点、世界观和身份获得上的多样性，或多或少是有意识的，思想、言论和行动上矛盾的演变也具有策略性。,"This diversity of perspectives, of world-views and identities possessed by an individual can be more and less conscious, the deployment of contradictions in thought, speech and action more and less strategic."
5731,矛盾可以隐匿在生活的瞬间，通过意识的存在启动记忆中的思想、感受、理解和情感，这就是弗吉尼亚·伍尔芙所说的“存在的瞬间”（Virginia Woolf 1976）。,"Contradiction may be disguised by the momentariness of life, by the way that conscious existence turns on momentary thoughts, feelings, apprehensions, emotions, on what Virginia Woolf refers to as ‘moments of being’ (1976)."
5731,因此，当矛盾出现在他们对世界做出解释时，出现在他们赋予人和事意义时，个体生活中的矛盾将会被每一时刻的实践压力吞噬——绝对的秩序使得某一特定观点被强加到那一时刻——并被时时刻刻发生的他们的意识生活的不断变迁所淹没。,"Hence, while contradictory in their interpretations of the world, in the meanings they imparted to people and events, nevertheless, the contradictoriness of individual lives may be swallowed up by the experiential intensity of each moment—by the absoluteness of order which one particular perspective leads them to attribute to that moment—and by the constant movement of their conscious lives from moment to moment."
5732,一直以来有一种说法:科学人类学也是一种“艺术”，民族志具有文学品质。,"It has long been asserted that scientific anthropology is also an ""art,"" that ethnographies have literary qualities."
5732,我们经常听说，某位著者的写作很有风格，某些描述生动或很有说服力 (难道不是所有精确的描述都有说服力吗？）。,"We often hear that an author writes with style, that certain descriptions are vivid or convincing (should not every accurate description be convincing?)."
5732,一部作品在描述了事实之外，还被认定表达年动或经过艺术构思；表现力和修辞功能被认为是装饰性的 或仅仅是更有效地提出客观分析或描述的方法。,"A work is deemed evocative or artfully composed in addition to being factual; expressive, rhetorical functions are conceived as decorative or merely as ways to present an objective analysis or description more effectively."
5732,因此，问题的事实部分至少在原则上是可以同它们的传达方式分离的，但民族志的文学或修辞之维不再可能如此容易地被分割开来。,"Thus the facts of the matter may be kept separate, at least in principle, from their means of communication.But the literary or rhetorical dimensions of ethnography can no longer be so easily compartmentalized."
5732,它们在文化科学的每一层面都很活跃。,They are active at every level of cultural science.
5732,确实文学”方法这个概念对于“人类学”这一学科来说，起了严重的误导作用。,"Indeed, the very notion of a ""literary"" approach to a discipline, ""anthropology,"" is seriously misleading."
5733,在我们讨论语言的语音和形态时，我们简略地考察了语言的内部组织——它的音系学、形态学、句法和语法。,"In our discussion of the sound and shape of language, we looked briefly at the internal organization of language—its phonology, morphology, syntax, and grammar."
5733,正是对语言的描述性研究，注重记录和说明一种特殊语言在其历史上任一时期出现的所有特点。,"Of various approaches to linguistics, descriptive linguistics is concerned with registering and explaining all the features of a particular language at any one time in its history."
5733,例如，描述语言学专家注重现代法语或西班牙语目前发生作用的方式，仿佛它们是独立的系统，它们内部是一致的，从来不考虑它们发展的历史原因。,"This approach concentrates, for example, on the way modern French or Spanish functions now, as if it were a separate system, consistent within itself, without any reference to historical reasons for its development."
5733,然而，语言就如文化的其他部分一样有其历史。,"Yet languages, like the rest of culture, have histories."
5734,苏丹制或描述制（Sudanese or Descriptive system），是在非洲苏丹南部的民族中发现的，苏丹制由以得名。,The Sudanese or descriptive system is found among the peoples of southern Sudan in Africa—hence the name Sudanese.
5734,除此之外，尽管它已经在中国农村逐步取代易洛魁亲属称谓制，但它还是在世界上很少社会中才见到。,"Otherwise, it is found among few of the world's societies, although it has come to replace Iroquois terminology among rural Ghinese."
5734,在这一制度中，母亲的兄弟与父亲的兄弟他们的称谓是有区别的，而父亲的兄弟和父亲的称谓也是不同的；母亲的姐妹和母亲是不同的，并且与父亲的姐妹也是区分开来的。,"In this system, the mother's brother is distinguished from the father’s brother, who is distinguished from the father; the mother's sister is distinguished from the mother, as well as from the father's sister."
5734,每一个堂表兄弟姐妹的称谓都彼此区分，并且他们和兄弟姐妹也是有区别的。,"Each cousin is distinguished from all others, as well as from siblings."
5734,因此它比其他任何一 种制度（包括英裔美国人所使用的那种）都要精确，这或许就是它为何如此稀少的一个原因。,"It is therefore more precise than any of the other systems (including that used by Anglo Americans), which may be one reason it is so rare."
5734,几乎没有什么社会将一个人所有的姑姨婶、叔伯舅、堂表兄弟姐妹以及自己的亲兄弟姐妹一一区分开来。,"In few societies are all aunts, uncles, cousins, and siblings treated differently from one another."
5735,例如，据一项保守的估计，20世纪80年代至少有1500个亚诺马密人死去，其中大多是蓄意大屠杀的受害者，他们是涌入巴西北部的牛仔和矿工。,"For example, as a conservative estimate, at least 1,500 Yanomami died in the 1980s, often as victims of deliberate massacres, as cattle ranchers and miners poured into northern Brazil."
5735,到1990年，亚诺马密人在巴西的土地已经有70%被违宪征用了；他们的鱼类供给受到河流里水银污染的毒化；而且疟疾、性病和肺结核猖獗。,"By 1990, 70% of the Yanomami's land in Brazil had been unconstitutionally expropriated; their fish supplies were poisoned by mercury contamination of rivers； and malaria, venereal disease, and tuberculosis were running rampant."
5735,亚诺马密人以每年10%的速度死去，而他们的出生率几乎已降到了零。,"The Yanomami were dying at the rate of 10% a year, and their fertility had dropped off to near zero."
5735,很多村子里已经没有儿童和老人，幸存的人们怀着对灭绝的极度恐惧等待着他们的命运。,"Many villages were left with no children or old people, and the survivors awaited their fate with a profound terror of extinction."
5736,人类学家一直都在批判城市化、大型社会，赞扬小型民间社区的美德。,"Anthropologists have been among those critical of the urbanized, large-scale society, while praising the virtues of the small folk community."
5736,人类学家与其他人一起，已经指出现代社会中的异化与丧失信心的无家可归者。,"Anthropologists, along with others, have pointed to the alienation and despair in modern society, the dreary abode of the ""homelessmind""."
5736,这些批评采取了许多形式，其中一种则是这样：都市社会使现代化技术的先进性变成一种自然系统，因为对手缺席；它是机械地组织而成，通过方法和目标，而不是经由文化通过意义组织而成，因此它是无意义的。,"These criticisms take many forms, but one is this, that the sheer technological sophistication of modern, urban society renders it a kind of natural system by default; it is organized technically, by means and ends, rather than culturally, by meaning, hence it is meaningless."
5737,这正是传统民俗研究中特别有意思的一类故事。,This is precisely the kind of tale of special interest in traditional folklore studies.
5737,它是一个在世界各地都很受欢迎的“傻瓜”故事，它在印度、中东、巴尔干半岛、意大利、西班牙、英格兰、美国和非洲西部有着各种各样的版本。,"It is an internationally popular ""numbskull"" tale; versions of it have been recorded in India, the Middle East, the Balkans, Italy, Spain, England, and the United States, as well as in West Africa."
5737,它表现一个基本主题（motif）或故事情境——父亲和儿子想要取悦每一个人——这一主题在世界各地成千上万的民俗中一再出 现。,It is classified or cataloged as exhibiting a basic motif or story situation—father and son trying to please everyone—one of the many thousands found to recur in world folktales.
5737,"尽管细节上有差别，但每一个版本在事件发生的顺序上都有相同的基本结构——有时又被叫作故事的句法：一个农民父亲和儿子在一起干活,然后买了一头载货的牲口，两人带着牲口外出进行一次短途旅行，父亲骑驴，受人批评，儿子骑驴，又受人批评，两个人都步行，两个人都受批评，因而得出结论。","Despite variations in detail, every version has about the same basic structure in the sequence of events, sometimes called the syntax of the tale: a peasant father and son work together, a beast of burden is purchased, the three set out on a short excursion, the father rides and is criticized, the son rides and is criticized, both walk and are criticized, and a conclusion is drawn."
5738,"但是民族主义和民主的基本前提是密切相关的：人民 (people)先于国家（state）,国家属于人民。",But the essential premises of nationalism and democracy are closely related: the notion that the people precedes the state and that the state belongs to it.
5738,在许多文献中，尤其是在法国大革命开创性时期中，“人民”与“民族”这两个词语是交互使用的。这种联系还不止于此。,"In much of the literature, especially in the seminal period of the French Revolution, the words ""people"" and ""nation"" are used interchangeably.And the connection does not stop there."
5739,"在某种意义上，人类学之于这些学科,就如实验室之于物理学和化学:是其理论必不可少的检验根据。",Anthropology is to these disciplines what the laboratory is to physics and chemistry：the essential testing ground for their theories.
5739,文化人类学可以划分为考古学、语言人类学和民族学（通常被称为社会文化人类学，参见图l.l），虽然每个分支有自己的专业兴趣和方法，但它们都研究文化资料。,"Cultural anthropology may be divided into the areas of archaeology, linguistic anthropology, and ethnology (often called sociocultural anthropology; Figure 1.1).Although each has its own special interests and methods, all deal with cultural data."
5739,考古学家、语言学家和民族学家对研究主题采取不同的研究方式，但是，它们每一学科都捜集和分析有助于说明人类文化相似性和差异性的数据，以及在任何地方不同文化发展、调适和持续变迁的方式。,"The archaeologist, the linguist, and the ethnologist take different approaches to the subject, but each gathers and analyzes data useful for explaining similarities and differences among human cultures, as well as the ways cultures everywhere develop, adapt, and continue to change."
5740,在某种意义上，人类学之于这些学科，就如实验室之于物理学和化学：是其理论必不可少的检验根据。,Anthropology is to these disciplines what the laboratory is to physics and chemistry: the essential testing ground for their theories.
5740,文化人类学可以划分为考古学、语言人类学和民族学（通常被称为社会文化人类学，参见图l.l），虽然每个分支有自己的专业兴趣和方法，但它们都研究文化资料。,"Cultural anthropology may be divided into the areas of archaeology, linguistic anthropology, and ethnology (often called sociocultural anthropology; Figure 1.1).Although each has its own special interests and methods, all deal with cultural data."
5740,考古学家、语言学家和民族学家对研究主题采取不同的研究方式，但是，它们每一学科都捜集和分析有助于说明人类文化相似性和差异性的数据，以及在任何地方不同文化发展、调适和持续变迁的方式。,"The archaeologist, the linguist, and the ethnologist take different approaches to the subject, but each gathers and analyzes data useful for explaining similarities and differences among human cultures, as well as the ways cultures everywhere develop, adapt, and continue to change."
5741,关于人权有很多“相互冲突的规范逻辑”理论模式可以考虑。,"A number of ideal-types of ""competing normative logics"" (Falk 1980) concerning human rights may be identified."
5741,在西方过去的两个世纪里，最为盛行的逻辑就是“集权主义”。,"For much of the past two centuries in the West, the prevailing logic has been what might be termed ""statist""."
5741,也就是说，民族一国家主张自己的主权以及他们自己在司法和政治上的平等权利；而且他们的公民权利是内部或者国内的事务，不受其他国家特权的干渉。,"That is, nation-states have demanded the right to their own sovereignty and their own juridical and political equality; as such, the rights of their citizens are internal or domestic matters, and it is outwith the prerogative of members of other states to intervene."
5741,这种逻辑脱胎于“霸权主义的”逻辑。,"Statist logic was a development out of ""hegemonic"" logic."
5742,民族语言学研究语言，因为语言与社会、文化的其他部分以及人类行为有关。,"Ethnolinguistics deals with language as it relates to society, the rest of culture, and human behavior."
5742,某些语言人类学家，追随本杰明˙李˙沃尔夫，已提出语言塑造人们的思维和行为方式的理论。,"Some linguists, following Benjamin Lee Whorf, have proposed that language shapes the way people think and behave."
5742,其他人却认为语言反映现实。,Others have argued that language reflects reality.
5742,虽然语言是灵活的和能适应新环境的，但是术语一日制定出来往往使自身永久化，它在很大程度上反映说话者的信念和社会关系。,"Although linguists find language flexible and adaptable, they have found that once a terminology is established, it tends to perpetuate itself and to reflect much about the speakers' beliefs and social relationships."
5742,例如，亲属称谓有助于揭示家庭的结抅是怎样的，亲属关系是亲密还是疏远，对亲属关系持什么样的态度。,"Kinship terms, for example, help reveal how a family is structured, what relationships are considered close or distant, and what attitudes are held toward relationships."
5742,同样，性別语言揭示在社会中男性和女性的相互关系。,"Similarly, gender language reveals how the men and women in a society relate to one another."
5743,民族学家研究的根基是民族志（ethnography）。,"Fundamental to the ethnologist, approach is descriptive ethnography."
5743,只要有可能，民族学家就设法生活在他正研究的那些人之中而成为民族志学家。,"Whenever possible, the ethnologist becomes ethnographer by going to live among the people under study."
5743,这种田野工作的意图，不只在于描述他们的文化，而且也要说明文化各方面的相互关系。通过参与观察（participant observation）与人们同吃一样的食物，说他们的语言，亲身体验他们的风俗和习惯——与任何非参与性人类学家或其他社会科学家所能做到的相比，民族志学家试图在更大程度上理解他们的生活方式；在你正做着田野工作的社会里，由于你学会了如何以那个社会接受的方式行事，那么你就最有效地学到了一种文化。,"Through participant observation—eating a peopled food, speaking their language, and personally experiencing their habits and customs—the ethnographer can understand their way of life to a far greater extent than any nonparticipant anthropologist or other social scientist ever could; one learns a culture best by learning how to behave acceptably in the society where one is doing fieldwork."
5743,要成为所研究文化的参与观察者并不意味着，为研究战争频繁的文化，民族志学家要加入人们的战斗；但是由于生活在好战的人群中，民族志学家应当能够理解战争是如何与整个文化结构相契合的。,"Participant observation of the culture under study does not mean the ethnographer must join in a peopled battles in order to study a culture where warfare is prominent; but by living among a warlike people, the ethnographer should be able to understand the role of warfare in the overall cultural scheme."
5744,"如柯尔斯顿·哈斯査普所说，民族志的现在时并不意味着不受时间影响是其他社会的一个特点，“但是我们确实强调民族志知识胜过经验主义的知识”（Kirsten Hastrup 1992，p.128）,因为它加深了我们对于人类总体状态的理解。不考虑历史演进地对社会生活进行研究，这一点也有一种明显的方法论优势。","As Kirsten Hastrup argues, the ethnographic present does not imply that timelessness is a feature of other societies, ""but we do stress that ethnographic knowledge transcends the empirical"" (1992, p. 128) in that it deepens our understanding of the human condition in general.There is also a clear methodological advantage involved in the synchronic study of social life."
5744,人类学可以被描述为你在河水中跋涉以及河水流动时你进行探究的过程，而历史学家却被迫研究干涸的河床。,"Anthropology may be described as the process whereby one wades into a river and explores it as it flows by, whereas historians are forced to study the dry riverbed."
5744,你不可能对过去的事情进行参与观察。,One cannot engage in participant observation of the past.
5745,列维·斯特劳斯认为（1961: 386）我们自己的民族中心主义是与某种实际存在的或仪式上的食人习俗的道德基础相关的。,Lévi-Strauss comments (1961:386) on our own ethnocentrism in being appalled on moral grounds by either actual or ritual cannibalism.
5745,谴责食人行为，意味着某种身体复活的观念，与身体在物质上被解体相对应。,"To condemn cannibalist practices implies for instance a belief in bodily resurrection, which would be compromised with the material destruction of the corpse."
5745,这作为一种宗教性的信仰和那些仪式性的食人行为所依据的信仰如出一辙。,This would be a religious belief of the same order as those in which ritualized cannibalism is practised.
5746,在1984年，古迪由欧内斯特˙盖尔纳（Ernest Gellner，1925—1995)所接替，后者同样关注那些在前辈的工作中从没有处于过中心地位的实质性问题：如苏联和东欧的政治与人类学以及穆斯林世界中的思维和社会，此外还有最具广泛影响性的民族主义的性质及其在欧洲的历史发展。,"In 1984 Goody was succeeded by Ernest Gellner (1925–1995), who likewise focused on substantive themes that had not been central to the work of the preceding generation: politics and anthropology in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe; thought and society in the Muslim world; and most broadly influential, the nature of nationalism and its historical development in Europe."
5746,盖尔纳出生在布拉格，在牛津接受的哲学训练，后被授予伦敦经济学院的一个哲学教职。,"Gellner was born in Prague, was trained at Oxford as a philosopher, and had been appointed to a post in philosophy at the LSE."
5746,他是对英国哲学的语言学转向进行批判的一个突出人物，著有广受赞誉的《词与物》（1959)。,He played a distinctiverole as a critic of the linguistic turn in British philosophy with his celebrated book Words and Things (1959).
5746,那时他正在伦敦经济学院的同事们的指导下在南非进行人类学田野作业，并选择把自己的职业身份转为社会人类学家。,
5747,这就是我向第二组撰稿人提出的问题：他们中一位是国际法方面的杰出理论家和实践者，再一位是国际关系方面的学术权威。前者是达尼洛·蒂尔克（Danilo Türk)，在民族自决的特殊表演中扮演着重要的角色。他的国家斯洛文尼亚在1991年6月宣布独立，从此南斯拉夫联盟开始瓦解（恰巧，他现在在联合国担任斯洛文尼亚代表）。,"This was the question I posed to the next pair of contributors: an outstanding theorist and practitioner of international law, and a leading academic authority on international relations.The former, Danilo Türk, played an important role in a specific act of national self-determination, when his country, Slovenia, declared itself independent in June 1991, thereby initiating the formal dissolution of the Yugoslav Federation.(Appropriately enough, he now represents Slovenia at the United Nations.)"
5748,下面我要论证，这些超越的意义不是“附加”在“单纯的”原始记录之上的抽象观念或者解释；相反，它们是使记录富有意义的条件。,"I argue below that these kinds of transcendent meanings are not abstractions or interpretations ""added"" to the original ""simple"" account.Rather, they are the conditions of its meaningfulness."
5748,民族志文本不可能摆脱寓言性，郑重地接受这一事实将改变它们可以被写作和阅读的方式。,"Ethnographic texts are inescapably allegorical, and a serious acceptance of this fact changes the ways they can be written and read."
5748,用肖斯塔克的试验作为研究案例，我将检査最近把文本内的各寓言层次辨识为明确的“多种声音”的趋势。,"Using Shostak's experiment as a case study I examine a recent tendency to distinguish allegorical levels as specific ""voices"" within the text."
5748,最后，我认为，民族志写作——被看作铭写（inscription)或文本化——的真正活力在于扮演一种救赎式的（redemptive）西方寓言。,"I argue, finally, that the very activity of ethnographic writing—seen as inscription or textualization—enacts a redemptive Western allegory."
5749,这样一来，个体抽象出来的个人结构就会产生具体效应：实际上，正是通过在整体的他者和自我之间建立起相互关联这种方式，个体才成为对他们自己而言具有真实性的事物。,"Thus do individuals' abstract personal constructs have concrete consequences.Indeed, it is by claiming a relevance which a host of others has for them, and which they have for others, that individuals' own selves become real to them."
5749,在世界中认知并命名对象就是赋予它们实体性和稳定性，（按照贝特森的说法（Bateson l951: 217）)就是将某种形式强加于另一个熵的世界，从而创造出“信息”。而且根据他们自己的假定所采取的行动对于个体来说是相互激发的。,"Cognizing and naming objects in the universe is to give them shape and stability, to impose form upon an otherwise ""entropic"" universe and so to create ""information"" (in Bateson’s terms (1951:217)), and acting with their selves upon their assumptions is for individuals to vitalize both."
5750,我们最多只是擅用工具的能工巧匠，巧妙地周旋于符号网络当中，尽管我们既没有发明这网络也无法控制它，我们能够期待的只 是随着语言母体中的符号之间的联系与差别而发生的偶然事件。,"At best, we are bricoleurs, skilfully operating amongst networks of signs which we did not invent and do not control.What we can mean is a contingent matter dependent upon relations and differences between signs in a linguistic matrix."
5750,这不存在原创性，只有无休止的不得要领的游戏：从一个符号到另一个符号的循环模仿。,"There is no originality here, only an endless discursive play: of signs relating to other signs in a parodic circle."
5750,我们无法找到通往现实之路，也不存在绝对的指示或真实的存在——即神或人——只有漫无边际的“没有开始也不会结束的模仿”。,There can be no escape to reality or an absolute referentiality or a real presence—God or Man—only discursive ‘mimesis without origin or end’.
5751,人可以说是在有意识地操控他们的生活，创造出他们生活所凭依的意义和规则，而不会屈从于无意识或先决的力量，也不会屈从于毫无根据的理由和约束。,"Human beings should be seen to be in conscious control of their lives, creating the meanings and regularities by which they live and not subject to unconscious or determining forces, to independent causes and constraints."
5751,他们可以被描述成自然、社会、文化或历史环境的占有者。,"They should be described as possessing agency with regard to natural, social, cultural or historical phenomena."
5751,最重要的是，使人类生活的复杂性具有表象上的正义：针对人类生活的个体性和共性、它的特质、模糊性和微妙性以及它的传统主义、它的快乐和荣誉以及它的残酷性和默然。,"Above all, representational justice should be done to the complexities of human life: to its individuality and commonality, its idiosyncrasy, ambiguity and nuance as much as its conventionalism, its pleasures and glories as well as its cruelties and ignorances."
5752,西方和非西方民族所进行的仪式活动同样都表达了这样一种信仰：人们可以借助某种规定的方式使超自然力量以某种方式起作用。,Ritual practices of peasant and non-Western peoples are often an expression of the belief they can make supernatural powers act in certain ways with certain prescribed formulas.
5752,这是经典人类学的巫术概念。,This is the classic anthropological notion of magic.
5752,詹姆斯˙弗雷泽爵士区分了两种巫术原则——“同类相生”（即模拟巫术）和接触巫术。,"Sir James Frazer differentiated two principles of magic—""like produces like"", or imitative magic, and the law of contagion."
5752,作为一种有效的方法，巫技的作用是使个人能够为自己的不幸找到解释而又 不用自己承担任何责任。,Witchcraft functions as an effective way for people to explain away personal misfortune without having to shoulder any of the blame.
5752,甚至恶巫技也能在社会控制领域起积极作用。,Even malevolent witchcraft may function positively in the realm of social control.
5752,它还可以在不破坏更大群体规范的情况下，为敌对和挫败情绪提供一条发泄途径。,It also may provide an outlet for feelings of hostility and frustration without disturbing the norms of the larger group.
5753,母方交表兄弟姐妹婚姻（cross-cousin marriage）（参见图8.2），指一个男子娶其母亲兄弟的女儿，或者一个女子嫁给其父亲姐妹的儿子（交表兄弟姐妹是指母亲兄弟的儿女或父亲姐妹的儿女）。在许多社会，从寻食者（如澳大利亚的原住民）到集约经营的农民（诸如印度南部的各个不同民族），这种姑与表兄弟姐妹婚姻是优先的婚姻形式。,"Matrilateral cross-cousin marriage (Figure 8.1)—that is, of a man to his mother's brother's daughter or of a woman to her father's sister's son (a cross cousin is the child of a mother's brother or a father's sister)—is a preferred form of marriage in a variety of societies ranging from food foragers (Australian Aborigines, for example) to intensive agriculturists (such as among various peoples of South India)."
5753,在寻食民族中，就财产方面看，他们几乎没有继承，这种婚姻有助于建立并维持社会群体之间亲戚相关的联系。,"Among food-foraging peoples, who inherit relatively little property, such marriages help establish and maintain ties of solidarity between social groups."
5754,在一段相对较长的时间里，性别在人类学研究中都是被忽视的。这似乎有点令人惊讶，因为性别身份很可能是个人身份中最为根本的基础。,"Gender was for a long time relatively neglected in anthropological research, which is perhaps surprising, since gender identity may well be the most fundamental basis for personal identity."
5754,经常因为其民族志的细节描写而备受赞赏的马林诺夫斯基，如今被认为完全忽视了重要的女性制度并夸大了男性对特罗布里恩德社会的再生产的贡献（Weiner 1988）。,"Malinowski, who has often been praised for his ethnographic detail, is now said to have neglected important women's institutions completely and exaggerated the contribution of men to the reproduction of Trobriand society (Weiner 1988)."
5754,在许多其他的经典研究中，社会行动者也或多或少地被视为与社会上的男性等同。,"In many other classic studies too, social actors are more or less seen as equivalent to social men."
5754,这种视角可以被称为大男子主义（andros在希腊语中是“男人”的意思）。,This kind of perspective may be called androcentric (andros is Greek for man).
5754,1970年代以后，情况似乎产生了变化，性别成为人类学研究中的一个核心话题。,"It seems to be changing, and gender has been a central topic in anthropological research since the 1970s."
5754,部分研究关注“原初的母权制”的概念：18世纪学界很普遍的一个观点是，人类社会最初是由女性统治的。,"Some of this research has concerned the notion of the ""original matriarchy"": the idea, common in nineteenth-century scholarship, that human society was originally ruled by women."
5754,从这个角度，有人认为，这类在许多民族中间流传很广的观念，很可能是由男人创造出来的错误观念，目的是为了证明他们凌驾于女人之上的权力是正当的（Bamberger 1974）。,"In this regard, it has been argued that such notions, which are widespread among many peoples, are probably myths created by men to justify their own power over women (Bamberger 1974)."
5755,可见，牧羊人的民主的、热爱自由的性格来自他们作为游牧民的谋生方式——恰恰也是这一点决定了他们的这一性格。,"The shepherds' democratic, freedom-loving character thus derives from, as it is determined by, their nomadic mode of subsistence."
5755,这位历史学家就是用这样一种方式赋予他的人物这祥一种受尊敬的性格。,The historian in this manner endows his subjects with a character to be revered.
5755,牧羊人生活在一个纯粹男性化的畜牧世界，他们在这里感到骄傲、自由、不受世俗财物的牵扯，并且不用与妇女或者说家户纠缠在一起。,"The shepherds reside within a purely masculine pastoral world, where they are proud, free, unencumbered by worldly goods, and without attachments to women or households."
5755,虽然作为“乡下的一个游牧的半无产阶级”与市场联系在起，但是这些人据信能够自由地迁徙，可以超越封建压迫的势力范围。,"Though linked to the market as a ""rural nomad semi-proletariat,"" these men purportedly move at liberty beyond the reach of feudal oppression."
5755,这位历史学家不加限制地把他的乌托邦憧憬浓缩在一句话里。他说皮埃尔˙莫里是一个快乐的牧羊人”(第135页）。,"The historian encapsulates his Utopian vision by saying, without qualification: ""Pierre Maury was a happy shepherd"" (135)."
5756,与较早期的工具相比，穆斯捷工具一般比较轻、比较小。,Mousterian tools are generally lighter and smaller than those of earlier traditions.
5756,先前的人只能从整个石核中得到两三块石片，而尼安德特人的工具制造者可以得到许多比较小的石片，他们对这些石片熟练地进一步加以修磨、磨尖。,"Whereas previously only two or three flakes could be obtained from the entire core, Neanderthal tool-makers obtained many more smaller flakes, which they skillfully retouched and sharpened."
5756,他们的工具组合也包括比以前时期更多样化的工具类型：手斧、石片、刮器、钻器、刨木用的凹口石片，以及多种可装在木棒上做成矛的尖状器。,"Their tool kits also contained a greater variety of types than the earlier ones： hand axes, flakes, scrapers, borers, notched flakes for shaving wood, and many types of points that could be attached to wooden shafts to make spears."
5756,这多种多样的工具促进了对于食物资源的有效利用，也提高了衣服和居所的品质。,This variety of tools facilitated more effective use of food resources and enhanced the quality of clothing and shelter.
5757,最晚直到19世纪60年代，穆尔曼第二代的学生中已有很多人都发现了他们老师的偏见和机会主义倾向。,"By the 1960s at the latest, many among Mühlmann's second generation of students sensed the biases and opportunistic priorities of their teacher."
5757,在某种程度上，这也与他的另一本有影响的书《人类学史》 (1948/1986)有关。,"To an extent this also had to do with another of his influential books, Geschichte der Anthropologie (1948/1986)."
5757,这一部人类学历史完全以一种片面的、辩护式的且以德国为中心的视角呈现了这一学科领域的发展变化。,"This history of anthropology presented a profoundly one-sided, apologetic, and Germano-centric perspective of the field's evolution."
5757,到1986年又再版了几次，该书几乎成了关于这一主题唯一的德语教科书。,"Republished several times until 1986, it was virtually the only textbook on the topic available in German."
5757,许多学生都能而且确实都选择了英语或法语教科书，或者被好的老师推荐这样做。,"Many students could and did resort to English or French textbooks, or were recommended to do so by good teachers."
5757,但是，在其他一些地方，三代德语区人类学的学生都是从一个与纳粹主义牵涉较多的人所写的书中来学习他们学科的历史的。,"Where this was not the case, however, three generations of Germanspeaking anthropology students learned the history of their field from a book by someone who had been most heavily involved with Nazism."
5758,世界卫生组织（WHO）估计，在世界各地，有3600万人感染HIV(艾滋病病毒——大部分艾滋病病人有这种病毒）在2000年11月，艾滋病病毒和艾滋病最沉重地打击了撒哈拉沙漠以南的非洲和东南亚地区，同时美国艾滋病病例累积总数达92万。,"The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates 18.5 million adults are infected with HIV (the virus present in most people wrth AIDS) worldwide, with 4.5 million of those people diagnosed with AIDS.While HIV and AIDS has hit areas of Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia hardest, as of June 1996, the Centers for Disease Control report a cumulative total of 548,102 AIDS cases in the United States, with 343,000 deaths."
5758,在我工作的加利福尼亚旧金山市，人口不到80万，有报告说，自1980年以来，已有24509例艾滋病 病例，16838人死于艾滋病。,"Where I work in San Francisco, California, a city of less than 800,000 people, there have been 24,509 AIDS cases and 16,838 deaths from AIDS reported since 1980."
5758,在这些病例中有22161例发生在该市同性恋者和与男女两性都有性行为的男子中。,"Of these cases, 22,161 are among gay and bisexual men in the city."
5759,阐释主义已经成为一个基础——后来用来扞击人们所断言的人类学的殖民心态和帝国主义基础。,The interpretivism already present served as a foundation – as did latter-day attacks on the alleged colonial mentality and imperialist foundation of anthropology.
5759,同一时期，女权主义人类学成长起来，进而对男权主义模式提出挑战，反思成为田野民族志方法的格言。写作和阅读在新的具有文学性的人类学中有了理论意义。,"In the same time period, feminist anthropology grew and further challenged androcentric models, reflexivity became a byword of ethnographic method, and writing and reading took on theoretical significance in the new, literarily aware an- thropology."
5760,然而，在某一级上实行外婚制的社会，可能在另一级上实行内婚制。例如，在特罗布里恩德岛民中，每个人都必须在其氏族或世系群之外婚配（外婚制）。然而，由于合法的性伴侣可能在某人自己的社区内寻觅到， 所以一般也实行村落内婚制，尽管这不是强制性的。,"However, since eligible sex partners are to be found within one's own community, village endogamy, though not obligatory, is commonly practiced."
5760,饶有兴趣的是，外婚制包括或不包括哪些亲戚，在不同的社会有很大的差异。,"Interestingly, a wide variety exists among societies as to which relatives are or are not covered by exogamy rules."
5760,例如，天主敎会一直禁止第一级的堂表兄弟姐妹之间的婚姻，而这样的婚姻在美国的31个州是非法的。在其他19个州，这类婚姻不是非法的，在欧洲也不是非法的。,"In Europe, for example, the Catholic Church has long had a prohibition on marriages to first cousins, and in the 19th century such marriages were illegal in most of the United States."
5760,此外，在其他许多社会，第一级堂表兄弟姐妹是优先选取的配偶。尽管有相反的虚构信念，但第一级堂表兄弟姐妹结婚生的孩子没有很大的风险。,"In numerous other societies, however, first cousins are preferred spouses."
5761,在田野工作、甚至是在比较分析中，内省和外省都是交互发挥作用的。,"In fieldwork and even in comparative analysis, introspection and extrospection interact."
5761,田野工作和比较分析并非只是一种收集数据的机械方式，而是关于自我与文化反射的一部分，可以使一个人意识到关于我们的文化什么是独特的、什么是共同的。方法是，通过从他人/他文化的角度看自己来理解他人。,Fieldwork and comparative analysis are not merely mechanical ways to gather data but are part of a reflection on self and culture that can alert one to what is unique and what is common about our culture.The trick is to grasp the other while seeing oneself (or one's culture) sharply in terms of the other.
5761,危险是，一个人会在他者那里看到太多或太少的自己，即过于主观或客观。,The danger is that one will see too much or too little of oneself in the other – excesses of subjectivity or objectivity.
5762,进入和转出年龄等级，可由个人来完成，或者由于生物学的区别，比如说青春期，或者由于得到社会认可的地位，比如说结婚或生孩子。,"Entry into and transfer out of age grades may be accomplished individually, either by a biological distinction, such as puberty, or by a socially recognized status, such as marriage or childbirth."
5762,尽管年龄等级的成员们可能具有很多共同点，可能参加相似的活动，可能彼此合作，还可能拥有相同的志向和抱负，但他们的成员资格可能不完全与生理年龄相符。,"Whereas age-grade members may have much in common, may engage in similar activities, may cooperate with one another, and may share the same orientation and aspirations, their membership may not be entirely parallel with physiological age."
5762,从年纪较小的等级进入年纪较大的等级的具体时间，往往是由仪式来确立的——犹太人的男孩成人仪式就是一个很好的例子。虽然年长群体的成员一般期望年轻群体的成员尊敬他们，并且承认自己对年轻人负有一定的责任，但这并不必然意味着一个年龄等级比另一个年龄等级更好，或者更糟，甚或更重要。,"A specific time is often ritually established for moving from a younger to an older grade.Although members of senior groups commonly expect deference from and acknowledge certain responsibil-ities to their juniors, this does not necessarily mean one grade is better or worse or even more important than another."
5763,在史前文化水平上，部族群体之间当然会有某些战争。,On preliterate cultural levels there was of course some fighting between tribal groups.
5763,争夺优良的猎场与渔场或其它自然资源，为真实或想象（巫术）的伤害而进行报复，导致了一定的部族冲突。,"Competition for favored hunting and fishing grounds or other natural resources, vengeance for real or fancied (e.g., magical) injuries, led to a certain amount of intertribal conflict."
5763,但尚不存在为大规模的、系统的和持久的战争所必需的因素。,But the factors necessary for large scale and systematic and sustained warfare w^ere lacking.
5763,然而，作为农业革命的结果，这些因素被提供出来了。,"These were supplied, however, as a consequence of the Agricultural Revolution."
5764,这些可能会使我们相信亲属制度不再重要了。,This may lead us to believe that kinship has ceased to be important.
5764,但是，在其社会组织的潜力之外，它还具有重要的象征维度。,"However, it has important symbolic dimensions in addition to its social organisational potential."
5764,在大多数已知的人类社会中，那就是，亲属制度是对于主观归属、安全感和个人身份的一个主要关注点。,"It is, in most known human societies, a main focus for subjective belongingness, sense of security and personal identity."
5764,在这些领域，似乎很明显的是，亲属制度至少部分地被诸如民族主义等隐喻的亲属制度意识形态所取代。,"In these fields, it seems clear that kinship has at least partly been replaced by metaphoric kinship ideologies such as nationalism."
5764,民族主义将民族呈现为家族群体的一种隐喻。,Nationalism presents the nation as a metaphoric kin group.
5764,和家系的思维方式一样，它强调“我们”和“他们”之间的对比，并且，尽管在其内部可能是追求平等和普遍性的，在关系到其他民族的时候却支持排他主义（参见第十八章）。,"Like lineage ideologies, it stresses the contrast between ""us"" and ""them"", and although it may be internally egalitarian and universalistic, it favours particularism in relation to other nations (see Chapter 18)."
5764,在特定的司法语境里，民族也可能像事实上的家系那样发挥作用。,The nation may also function as a de facto lineage in certain judicial contexts.
5764,如果一个公民死后而没有个人的继承者，国家会继承他的财产；在某些情况下，国家也可能对孩子们承担起做父母的责任。,"If a citizen dies with no personal inheritors, the state inherits the estate.The state may also, in certain cases, assume the parental responsibility for children."
5765,大多数北美人熟悉的配偶家庭形式是独立的核心家庭，尽管它急剧衰退，但在美国和加拿大仍被广泛地视为一种理想。,"The form of conjugal family most familiar to most North Americans is the independent nuclear family, which in spite of its precipitous decline is still widely regarded as the ""standard"" in the United States and Canada."
5765,在这些国家中，年轻人在超过一定的年龄之后就不希望与自己的父母生活在一起，而一对夫妇也并没有一种道德上的责任要把自己因年迈而生活无法自理的父母接到自己家中。,"In these countries it is not considered desirable for young people to live with their parents beyond a certain age, nor is it considered a moral responsibility for a couple to take their aged parents into their home when the parents no longer can care for themselves."
5765,退休社区和护理院可以提供这些服务，把年老的父母接到自己的家中，一般不仅被视为是一种经济负担， 而且也是对该家户的隐私和独立性的一种威胁。,"Retirement communities and nursing homes provide these services, and to take aged parents into one's home is commonly regarded as not only an economic burden but also a threat to the households privacy and independence."
5766,列维－斯特劳斯对人类心智共同性的另一重要探寻，就是我们前面所说的第二个例子：以雅克布森的“辅音三角”和“元音三角”理论为基础的所谓“烹饪三角”。,"One of the most indicative of Le ́vi-Strauss’ excursions into the universality of the human mind is that of our second example: the ‘culinary triangle’, based on Jakobson’s ‘consonant triangle’ and ‘vowel triangle’."
5766,列维－斯特劳斯最早在1965 年的一篇文章中提出这一观点。而后又对此进行了数次论证，特别是在《神话学》第三卷的结尾部分。（Le ́vi - Strauss 1978b [1968]: 471-95),"Le ́vi-Strauss first published on the idea in an article in 1965, and this was followed by several discussions, notably in the conclusion to the third volume of the Mythologiques (Le ́vi-Strauss 1978b [1968]: 471–95)."
5767,在肯尼亚北部的游牧民族中，家庭支配的动物数目与可用来照料动物的妇女数目直接相关。,"Among the Turkana, a pastoral nomadic people of northern Kenya, the number of animals at a family disposal is directly related to the number ( adult women available to care for them."
5767,男子拥有的妇女越多，照顾家畜的妇女就越多，家庭财富就可能越充裕。,"The more wives a man has, the more women there are looking after the livestock and the more substantial are the family holdings."
5767,因此，男子现有的妻子积极寻找另外的女人嫁给其丈夫，就不异乎寻常了。,"Thus, it is not uncommon for a man's existing wife to actively search for another woman to marry her husband."
5767,另外，丰厚的聘礼与婚姻有关，只有那些拥有财富且地位显赫的男子才担负得起大量妻子的费用。,"Again, however, a substantial bride-price is involved in marriage, and only men of wealth and prominence can afford large numbers of wives."
5768,后来进一步发展了韦伯的理论的帕森斯（Talcott Parsons 1977），把现代社会看做是以成就为导向，具有普遍性，这与“传统社会”相反，他认为后者是以归属为导向，具有特殊性。,"Talcott Parsons, who later developed Weber's theory further (1977), regarded modern societies as achievement-oriented and universalistic, as opposed to ""traditional"" societies, which he saw as ascription-oriented and particularistic."
5768,这种区分意味着现代社会中人的等级和职业机会由其成就和获得身份决定，平等对待所有的人（特别是平等的市民权利和法律面前人人平等）是重要的原则。,"This distinction means that a person's rank and career opportunities in a modern society depend on his or her achievements and achieved statuses, and that equal treatment for all (notably equal civil rights and equality before the law) is an important principle."
5768,相反，在传统社会，帕森斯认为，通常与亲属制度相联系的归属身份更具决定性，也就是说，你做什么没有你是什么来得重要。,"In a traditional society, on the contrary, Parsons held that ascribed statuses, frequently connected with kinship, were more decisive; in other words, that it was less important what a person did than what he or she was."
5769,在分层社会中，人们分成两个或更多的类别，他们不平等地分享基本资源、影响力或声望。,"A stratified society is divided into two or more categories of people who do not share equally in basic resources, influence, and prestige."
5769,这一社会形式与平等社会截然相反，平等社会拥有的重要职位与有能力担任这些职位的人一样多。,"This form contrasts with the egalitarian society, which has as many valued positions as persons capable of filling them."
5769,社会可能以多种方式分层，比如性别、年龄、社会阶级或等级。,"Societies may be stratified in various ways, such as by gender, age, social class, or caste."
5769,阶级成员平等或几乎平等地享有获得基本资源和声望(根据人们定义“声望”的方式)的权利。,Members of a class enjoy equal or nearly equal access to basic resources and prestige (according to the way the latter is defined).
5769,阶级差异并不总是清晰而明显的。,Class differences are not always clear and obvious.
5769,如果人们在特权方面做出泾渭分明的区别， 其结果就有多个阶级，在只做笼统区别的社会中，只有少数几个阶级可以识别出来。,"Where fine distinctions are made in privileges, the result is a multiplicity of classes.In societies where only gross distinctions are made, only a few social classes may be recognized."
5770,"人类社会组织的三种重要因素,很可能是与为肉食而清理动物尸体，以及狩猎一起发展起来的。",Three important elements of human social organization probably developed along with scavenging and hunting for meat.
5770,这些因素是按照性别的分工、食物分享，以及作为日常活动中心及食物分享地点的营地。,"These are a sexual division of labor, food sharing, and the camp as the center of daily activity and the place where food sharing occurs."
5770,寻食社会的特点是它们的平等主义。,A characteristic of food-foraging societies is their egalitarianism.
5770,因为这种生活方式要求流动，人们只积累生存所必需的物质物品，因此地位差别限于以年龄和性别为依据的差别。,"Since this way of life requires mobility, people accumulate only the material goods necessary for survival, so status differences are limited to those based on age and sex."
5770,然而，与性别相关的地位差别并不意味着妇女从属于男子。,"Status differences associated with sex, however, do not imply subordination of women to men."
5770,食物资源在整个群体中平均分配；因此，任何个人都不可能获得积聚物品可能带来的财富或地位。,Food resources are distributed equally throughout the groups; thus no individual can achieve the wealth or status hoarding might bring.
5771,到目前为止描述的赠送、接受和分享形成社会保障或保险的一种形式。,"Giving, receiving, and sharing as so far described constitute a form of social security or insurance."
5771,一个家庭有财力时就为他人奉献，因而可以指望在需要时得到他人的回报。,A family contributes to others when they have the means and can count on receiving from others in time of need.
5771,调整机制在泛化互惠或平衡互惠过程中起作用，促使财富在长时期内平等分配。,"A leveling mechanism is at work in the process of generalized or balanced reciprocity, promoting an egalitarian distribution of wealth over the long run."
5772,从20世纪70年代以来，这在一些研究结果中产生了一些张力。,This produced some tension in the research findings from the 1970s.
5772,尽管那一时期的性别研究学者拥有一种很强的意识，即男性占据主导地位是错误的，但这与他们的文化相对主义的感觉则相互冲突。,"Although the scholars of gender during that period operated with a strong sense that male domination was wrong, this conflicted with their sense of cultural relativism."
5772,相对主义要求了解处在某一特定文化背景下的每种现象，这破坏了“男性占据主导地位是错的”这一普遍价值。,"That is, relativism called for understanding every phenomenon in a particular cultural context, which undermined the universal value that male dominance is wrong."
5772,具有讽刺意味的是那些证明在其他文化中有多少女性享有权力位置的研究。,"Ironically, the result was research that proved how many women enjoyed positions of power in other cultures."
5773,民族认同主要源自公民因素，虽然要承认的是，它也会包含文化和族裔因素，但后者只有符合我所提出的其他限制条件时才能实现。,"The identity of the nation is conceived primarily in civic terms, though it is to be acknowledged that this will also draw in elements of the cultural and the ethnic; these latter are accepted only to the extent that they are compatible with the other constraints for which I argue."
5773,不必说，自由主义是一个颇具争议的概念或政治思想、计划的集合体。但是，要想准确判断一种思想是否属于自由主义思想，必须以两种原则或态度为基础，即普遍主义和个人主义。,"Needless to say, liberalism is a much-contested concept or family of political ideas and programmes.But two principles or attitudes should be seen as fundamental for anything credibly recognisable as belonging to the family of liberal thought.These are universalism and individualism."
5774,虽然西医的开北医生一向把招魂术士和其他民间医治者看作是“无知的”，如果不是看作“庸医”的话，但是，在20世纪50年代，精神科医生与传统治疗者开始合作，进行以社区为基础的治疗实验。,"Although practitioners of Western medicine traditionally have regarded spiritists and other folk healers as ""ignorant,"" if not ""charlatans,"" efforts in the 1950s began experimentation with community-based treatment in which psychiatrists cooperated with traditional healers."
5774,自那时以来，这种研究方式在世界各地获得普遍承认，与此同时（1977年），世界卫生组织提倡健康专家与当地专家（包括草药医师和助产士）合作。,"Since then, this approach has gained widespread acceptance in many parts of the world, as when (in 1977) the World Health Organization advocated cooperation between health professionals and native specialists (including herbalists and midwives)."
5774,结果，许多人类学家找到了文化经纪人的工作，研究委托人的文化系统，向健康专家解释这种文化，而且也向民间医师和委托人解释精神科医生的工作。,"As a consequence, many anthropologists have found work as cultural brokers, studying the cultural system of the client population and explaining ""this to the health professionals while also explaining the world of the psychiatrists to the folk healers and the client population."
5775,由是，中介活动也常常借用贫困来象征各种现象和关系，尤其是社会关系。,"Liminality, then, often draws on poverty for its repertoire of symbols, particularly for its symbols of social relationship."
5775,同样，我们在日常生活中所见到的那些悠然世外的人，尤其是那些居住在郊区群居村中的人们也喜欢借用贫困所带有的象征含义来表达自己的观念。,"Similarly, as we have seen, the voluntary outsiders of our own society, particularly today's voluntary rural communards, also draw upon the symbolic vocabulary of poverty and indigence."
5775,最近一段时间，还有一种社会现象引起了人类学家和历史学家的浓厚兴趣，它和我们上面所说的各种颂扬乞讨的修道会以及现今的反文化运动组织有许多相似之处。,Both the mendicant orders and today's counterculture have affinities with another social phenomenon which has recently aroused great interest among anthropologists and historians.
5776,一些女性主义者试图借用传统上男性关于正义的理论，来建立他们所理解的女性对护理和养育的关注（Benhabib 1992; Baier 1994）。,Some feminists are attempting to wed the traditionalmale theories of justice and contract theory with what they understand to be the female concerns of care and nurturance (cf. Benhabib 1992; Baier 1994).
5776,也就是说，他们在寻求能够把“公共”纳入到女性内在的事务中，例如养育孩子，以及所有其他的我们每天都会碰见并关注的责任。,In other words they are trying to find ways in which ‘the public’ can responsibly include the female domestic matters of childrearing and all the other normal concerns and responsibilities with which we are daily and intimately most concerned.
5776,这些作者假定这些“内在”的事务，以及对关心和信任的需要，主要与性别有关，只是女性的兴趣。,"These writers assume ‘the domestic’, and the concern for care and trust, to be largely a matter of gender, of interest to females but not males."
5776,对这些人来说，不同性别具有不同的道德视野：男人倾向于在责任、契约和公正中定义道德，女人则更多的是关注与养育孩子相关的道德，例如爱、关心、信任和合作。,"For them, the genders have different moral outlooks: while men tend to phrase morality in terms of obligation, contract and justice, women are most concerned with a morality relevant to the bringing up of children, engendering of love, care, trust and cooperation."
5777,进行强化仪式并不非得局限于明显危机的时候。,The performance of rites of intensification does not have ro be limited to times of overt crisis.
5777,在那些四季分明、人们的活动要随之变化的地区，强化仪式以一年一度的庆典形式出现。,"In regions where the seasons differ enough that human activities must change accordingly, they take the form of annual ceremonies."
5777,这种庆典在从事园艺和农业的民族中特别常见——他们在栽种、第一批果实和收获时举行庆典。,These are particularly common among horticultural and tion of magic.
5777,对于这些社会中的人们而言，这些都是他们生活中特别重要的时刻，而庆典则表达出人们对于他们自己所赖以生存的自然之生产和繁育力量的一种尊敬态度。,"Many societies have magical rituals to ensure good crops, the replenishment of game, the fertility of domestic animals, and the avoidance or cure of illness in humans."
5777,如果事事顺利的话——就像在这些时候通常发生的那样——参与节日庆典将强化群体的介入。,
5777,它还可以被视为一种应对严重危机处境的仪式彩排；促进通过仪式活动依 赖超自然力量的习惯——在充满压力，然而又不能向恐惧和绝望让步的环境中，这种习惯很容易被激活。,
5778,北美人都很熟悉亲类，那些属于某个亲类的人被简单地叫作亲戚。,North Americans are all familiar with the kindred; those who belong are simply called relatives.
5778,亲类包括我们在重要场合都能看到的家庭双边的有血缘关系的亲属，这些重要场合如家庭聚会和葬礼。,"It includes the relatives on both sides of the family who are seen on important occasions, such as family reunions and funerals."
5778,大多数美国人都能识别他们的亲类成员，包括祖父母、外祖父母和第一代堂表兄弟姐妹——如果不能总是识别第二代堂表亲的话。,"Most people in the United States can identify the members of their kindred up to grandparents and first, if not always second, cousins."
5778,然而，亲类的界线是可变的和不确定的，在每一次重大聚会时，没有人能够绝对确定哪些亲属该请，哪些亲属不该请。,"The limits of the kindred, however, are variable and indefinite; no one ever can be absolutely certain which relatives to invite to every important function and which to exclude."
5779,他们用两种不同的方式狩猎:一个人时，就用弓箭，很多人时，就用网。,"They carry out hunting in two different ways: individually, with bow and arrow, and collectively, with nets."
5779,妇女和儿童采集可食用的各种东西，他们的选择很多。,"Women and children gather edible things, which are abundant."
5779,在他们看来，食物短缺要归因于懒惰。,"In their own view, any shortage of food is due to laziness."
5779,穆布提人以大约20人的规模群居，具有一种分类的亲属制度，即同样的亲属称谓被用来表示不同的（或根本没有）生物关系的个体。,"The Mbuti live in groups numbering about 20 persons and have a classificatory kinship system, which means that the same kinship terms are used to denote individuals who are differently (or not at all) biologically related."
5779,等级由性别、年龄和个人威望决定，生命阶段的转换由详细的过渡仪式（rite of passage）来标志。,"Rank is determined according to gender, age and personal authority, and the transition between life-stages is marked by elaborate rites of passage."
5779,婚礼也是重要的仪式，离婚是不被赞成的。,Weddings are also important rituals and divorce is discouraged.
5779,尽管婚外性行为会有发生，但却是不被批准的，调情的行为面临严格的约束。,"Although non-marital sex occurs, it is negatively sanctioned.Flirtation is subjected to strict rules."
5780,为了使关于婚姻和亲属制度的这两章内容更完美，似乎有必要简单地阐述一下亲属制度和性别之间的关系。,"To round off these two chapters about kinship and marriage, it seems appropriate to linger briefly on the relationship between kinship and gender."
5780,在“亲属制度学”的全盛时期，也就是1960年代，除了一些显著的例外，人类学家并没有特别关注作为一种区分性原则的性别。,"During the heyday of ""kinshipology"", up to the 1960s, anthropologists were, with a few notable exceptions, not particularly interested in gender as a differentiating principle."
5780,今天，当我们阅读博厄斯、克罗伯、马林诺夫斯基、拉德克利夫-布朗、普里査德和福特斯的经典著作，会惊讶于他们缺乏性别分析，缺乏对性别差异产生的社会和文化产品的分析。,"When reading the classic studies of Boas, Kroeber, Malinowski, Radcliffe-Brown, Evans-Pritchard and Fortes today, the absence of analyses of gender and the social and cultural production of gender differences is striking."
5780,对亲属制度的研究中，男性视角常常被认为是理所当然的。,"In studies of kinship, a male perspective is often taken for granted."
5780,当然，女性在他们的研究中也有位置，她们有时是妻子、母亲和姐妹，但很少是独立的行动个体。,"Certainly, women have a place in these studies; they sometimes appear as wives, mothers and sisters, but rarely as independently acting persons."
5781,[青春期]并不意味着危机或紧张的阶段，反而是一系列成熟的兴趣和活动的一个有序发展时期。,"[Adolescence] represented no period of crisis or stress, but was instead an orderly developing of a set of slowly maturing interests and activities."
5781,女孩的思想没有被矛盾所困惑，没有因哲学问题而苦恼，也没有困扰于自己的远大理想。,"The girls' minds were perplexed by no conflicts, troubled by no philosophical queries, beset by no remote ambitions."
5781,女孩的生活就是与尽可能多的爱人在一起，然后在自己的村子里结婚，与自己的亲戚们住得不远，生很多孩子，这些就是始终如一并令人满意的理想生活。,"To live as a girl with many lovers as long as possible and then to marry in one's own village, near one's relatives, and to have many children, these were uniform and satisfying ambitions."
5781,（Mead 1978，p.129）,"(Mead 1978, p. 129)"
5782,图尔德在哥大的岁月与区域研究，包括区域研究计划的发展是同时的。这些计划的目的在于获得与美国国家利益有战略牵连的新兴国家的知识。,"Steward’s Columbia years coincided with the development of area research, including area studies programs that were intended to yield knowledge of the emerging nations strategic to U.S. national interests."
5782,在这样的背景以及来自洛克菲勒基金会的资助下，斯图尔德发起了一次对波多黎各的大规模调查，并使得美国政策的目标与该岛的经济转型相适应。,"In that context, and with funding from the Rockefeller Foundation, Steward embarked on a major investigation of Puerto Rico, then the object of U.S. policy geared toward economic transformation of the island."
5782,在制定这个项目时，他抵制了复杂社会研究中的多种趋向：其中包括涵化研究，即认为存在一种统一的部落文化遭遇一种统一的国家文化的情形；还包括了在论述社区时把它们看作是一个国家的缩影的做法；以及国民性格方法，即将国家文化视为无差別的整体并且从“人格”的角度来分析它们。,"In planning the project, he was reacting against several trends in the study of complex societies: acculturation studies, which saw a uniform tribal culture confronting a uniform national culture; the treatment of communities as if they were microcosms of a nation; and the national character approach, which took national cultures as undifferentiated wholes and analyzed them as ""personalities."""
5783,"与趋同演化现象有某种程度类似的是平行演化(parallel evolution),差异在于,相似的调适是由那些其祖先文化有某种程度相似的民族获得的。","Somewhat similar to the phenomenon of convergent evolution is parallel evolution, the difference being that similar adaptations are achieved by peoples whose ancestral cultures were already somewhat similar."
5783,例如，西南亚和中美洲农业的发展过去是独立发生的，就如两地的民族那样，他们的生活方式过去已是类似的，他们转而成为依靠狭窄范围的植物食粮的依赖者，这些植物食粮取 决于人为介入对其保护和繁殖的成功。,"For example, the development of farming in southwest Asia and Mesoamerica took place independently, as people in both places, whose ways of life were already alike, became dependent on a narrow range of plant foods that depended upon human intervention for their protection and reproductive success."
5783,重要的是认识到，稳定和变迁都包含在演化的调适内，而且一且达到令人满意的调适，变迁程度太大却可能使它失效。,"It is important to recognize that stability as well as change is involved in evolutionary adaptation and that once a satisfactory adaptation is achieved, too much change may cause it to break down."
5784,这一复杂的跨学科领域的发展始自人类学的危机，如今仍是变化的、多样的。,"This complex interdisciplinary area, approached here from the starting point of a crisis in anthropology, is changing and diverse."
5784,因此我不想给本书的探索性文章强加一种虚假的一致性。,Thus I do not want to impose a false unity on the exploratory essays that follow.
5784,虽然作者们都于一种混合了诗学、政治学和史学的方法心有威威，他们也常常有不一致的时候。,"Though sharing a general sympathy for approaches combining poetics, politics, and history, they frequently disagree.Many of the contributions fuse literary theory and ethnography."
5784,一些人査考上述态度的局限，强调制度化权力的限制和唯美主义的危险；其他人热情倡导试验性写作形式。,"Some probe the limits of such approaches, stressing the dangers of estheticism and the constraints of institutional power.Others enthusiastically advocate experimental forms of writing."
5784,但他们都出于对未来的可能性的承诺，以不同的方式共同分析了过去和现在的实践。,But in their different ways they all analyze past and present practices out of a commitment to future possibilities.
5784,他们视民族志写作为变动不居的、创造性的：以威廉˙卡洛斯˙威廉斯（William Carlos Williams）的话说，“历史对于我们，应该像小提琴家的左手一样”。,"They see ethnographic writing as changing, inventive: ""History,"" in William Carlos Williams's words, ""that should be a left hand to us, as of a violinist."""
5785,全球化作为进化论者和后现代人类学家共同提出的主题，人类学家无论在田野调查和参加会议时都会遇到。它已经成为一个普遍而及时的关注点。,"As a theme promoted by both evolutionist and postmodernist anthropology as well as a topic visible to anthropologists whenever they do fieldwork or even attend conferences, globalization is a popular and timely concern."
5785,具有讽刺意味的是，在理论术语中它或许很容易会被视为与最落伍的理论观点传播论相等同。,"The irony is that in theoretical terms it might as easily be seen as most akin to the least trendy of all theoretical perspectives, diffusionism."
5786,以下的例子可能很有趣，因为它展示了一种很少被社会科学家所研究的与国家有关的过程，也就是国家逐渐解脱于人民的过程。,"The following example may be interesting as it displays a kind of process rarely studied by social scientists concerned with the state, namely one of progressive liberation of the state from the people."
5786,卡杰萨·埃克赫姆·弗里德曼（Kajsa Ekholm Friedman 1991，1994）研究的中部非洲国家——刚果，1962年由法国殖民地变为独立国家，它人口稀少而自然资源丰富，但是，这个国家在其独立化的过程中，经历了几乎连续不断的经济衰退。,"The Central African state of Congo, studied by Kajsa Ekholm Friedman (1991, 1994), became independent from France in 1962.It was thinly populated and rich in natural resources."
5786,1990年代早期，这个国家在一些重要的方面分崩离析：学校、医院和道路不再继续运转，腐败和裙带关系成为官僚政治效率的严重阻碍，而国家在减轻贫困地区的痛苦方面无所作为。,"Nevertheless, the country has experienced a nearly continuous economic decline througout its period of independence; in the early 1990s the state was disintegrating in important ways: schools, hospitals and roads were not being maintained, corruption and nepotism were serious obstacles to bureaucratic efficiency, and the state did nothing to alleviate the misery of poverty-stricken areas."
5786,在许多方面，政府都在国家的公共事务中缺席。,"In many ways, the state was absent from public affairs in the country."
5786,然而公共服务是一个很大的雇主方，因为生产手段是属于国家的，政府因此拥有大量资金。,"Yet the public service was a very large employer, and since the means of production were stateowned, the state had ample funds."
5787,群体成员的归属以相同的方式变化。,Ascription of group membership varies along the same lines.
5787,在母系社会，自己与其母亲、母亲的母亲、母亲的兄弟、母亲的兄弟的孩子们，等等，是同一家族群体的成员。,"In a matrilineal society, ego will be a member of the same kin group as his or her mother, mother's mother, mother's brother, mother's brother's children, etc."
5787,在父系社会，你和你的父亲、父亲的父亲、父亲的兄弟、父亲的兄弟的孩子们，等等，属于同一群体。,"; in a patrilineal society, one belongs to the same group as one's father, father's father, father's brother, father's brother's children, etc.."
5787,在父系系统，男人的妻子确保群体的延续性；在母系系统，由男人的姐妹们确保这一点。,"In patrilineal systems, the wives of the men ensure the continuity of the group; in matrilineal systems, the men's sisters do it."
5787,某些社会中，自己可以通过父亲接收某些权利，通过母亲接收另一些权利，但是，只要存在家族关系为基础的社团的任何地方，这方面几乎总要遵从一个原则。,"In certain societies, ego can take over certain rights through his or her father and others through the mother, but wherever kin-based corporations exist, one of the principles is nearly always followed in this respect."
5788,显然，任何对群体人格富有成效的研究都必须承认，每个个体在遗传和生活经验方面在某种程度上都是独一无二的，而且必须预计在任何社会中都可能有一系列人格类型。,"Obviously, any fruitful approach to the problem of group personality must recognize that each individual is unique to a degree in both inheritance and life experiences and must expect a range of personality types in any society."
5788,另外，在男人那里被视为合适的人格特质在女人那里可能就不合适，反之亦然。,"In addition, personality traits that may be regarded as appropriate in men may not be so regarded in women and vice versa."
5788,考虑到所有这一切，我们就可以把我们的注意力放在一个群体的典型人格（modal personality）上。我们把典型人格定义为由限定频率分布的集中趋势表示的、以文化为界线的一类人所特有的人格。,"Given all this, we may focus our attention on the modal personality of a group, defined as the personality typical of a culturally bounded population, as indicated by the central tendency of a defined frequency distribution."
5788,典型人格是统计学的概念，而且它本身就开辟了对于社会如何组织多样性以及多样性怎样与文化变迁相联系等问题的研究。,"Modal personality is a statistical concept, and, as such, it opens for investigation the questions of how societies organize diversity and how diversity relates to culture change."
5789,在德国，法国式的理性普遍主义被完全丢弃，代之以由文化和种族歧视造成的对约翰˙戈特利布˙赫德所持诸文化的特殊性这一信条越来越严重的扭曲。,"By preserving a place for rationalism, the early-nineteenth-century reaction to the Enlightenment took a very different form in France than in Germany, where French rational universalism came to be rejected totally in favor of the increasing distortion, through cultural and racial discrimination, of Johann Gottlieb von Herder's doctrine of the particularity of cultures."
5789,这种扭曲在尼采的非理性主义、黑格尔将领袖和国家等同，并最终在法西斯主义的种族迫害罪行当中达到顶峰（在本书上一部分中，安德˙金格里奇讨论了德国启蒙运动在后拿破仑时代的命运）。,"This culminated in the irrational of Nietzsche, the identification of leader and state through Hegel, and ultimately the racist crimes of Naziism (elsewhere in this volume Andre Gingrich discusses the post-Napoleonic fate of the German Enlightenment)."
5789,当然，法国也产生出了阿蒂尔˙德˙戈比诺（Arthur de Go- bineau)和保罗˙布罗卡（Paul Broca)的种族主义以及古斯塔夫˙勒庞（Gustave Le Bon)的群体心理学，这些都对法西斯主义理论产生了影响（Neocleous 1997)。,"Of course, France also produced the racism of Arthur de Gobineau and Paul Broca and the crowd psychology of Gustave Le Bon, both of which influenced fascist theory (cf. Neocleous 1997)."
5789,然而，从长远来看，它们在法国思想中始终处于边缘地位。,"In the long term, however, they remained marginal to French thought."
5790,热力学第二定律告诉我们，宇宙整体在结构上正在分解，在动力上正在变弱，物质日渐无序，能量则在均速耗散。,The Second Law of Thermodynamics tells us that the cosmos as a whole is breaking down structurally and running down dynamically; matter is becoming less organized and energy more uniformly diffused.
5790,但是，在宇宙的一个极小片断，即在有生命的物质系统中，宇宙过程的发展方向恰好相反。物质变得高度有序，能量日益聚汇起来。,"But in a tiny sector of the cosmos, namely in living material systems, the direction of the cosmic process is reversed: matter becomes more highly organized and energy more concentrated."
5790,生命是一个更新的过程。,Life is a building up process.
5790,但是，要与宇宙的这一趋势反其道而行之，生物有机体就必须从非生命系统中汲取游离能量，将它收集起来，用于维持生命过程。,"But in order to run counter to the cosmic current, biological organisms must draw upon free energy in non-living systems, capture it and put it to work in the maintenance of the vital process."
5791,在这里，应该补充的一点是，人类学对公众的和社会的事物的强调并不必然意味着否定私人的和“内心的”事物的存在。,"It should at this point be added that the anthropological emphasis on everything public and social does not necessarily mean that nothing private and ""inner"" exists."
5791,许多作家对公众的和私人的自我做了区分;后者是主语的“我（I），因为它是从其内部反观自身，当然，人类学家是不能从外部直接观察到的。,"Many writers distinguish between the public and private self; the latter being the ""I"" as it sees itself from the inside, which is not, of course, available for direct observation by an anthropologist."
5791,如林哈德（Lienhardt 1987）曾经提到过的，一些非洲民族谈论身份的方式与我们的这种区分非常相似。,"As Lienhardt (1987) has noted, several African peoples talk of identity in a way that is closely related to this distinction of ours."
5791,他们使用了龟的比喻，区分公开形象 （龟伸出它的头和四肢）和私下形象（龟缩回壳中）。,"Using the metaphor of the tortoise, they distinguish between the public persona (the tortoise displaying its head and limbs) and the private persona (the tortoise withdrawn in its shell)."
5791,尽管这两个层面的人格当然是相连的，却很难将一种简化为另一种。,"Although the two levels of personhood are certainly related, it is difficult to reduce one to the other."
5792,因此，环境决定论以其正面的（人类地理学）和负面的（可拒论）两种形式，陷人了缺乏理论分析潜力的泥潭。,"Thus environmental determinism, in both its positive (anthropogeography) and negative (possibilism) forms, suffers from a lack of analytical potential."
5792,就如格尔茨所言，环境决定论“只能提出一些最粗糙的问题：‘环境在多大程度上影响文化？’……也只能作出最简单的回答：在某种程度上可以做出回答，但不全面”（1963:3)。,"It can, as Geertz argued, ""ask only the grossest of questions: 'How far is culture influenced byenvironment?'…And can give only the grossest of answers: 'To a degree, but not completely'"" (1963:3)."
5792,环境决定论能够建立一套“可用于任何环境与文化状态”的一般性规则，但却无法回答有关“特殊的文化特性及其模式的起源”问题，也不能说出为何这种特殊的文化特征及模式会在不同的区域出现（Steward 1955:36)。,"It can establish general principles ""applicable to any cultural-environmental situation"", but can say nothing about ""the origins of particular cultural features and patterns which characterize different areas"" (Steward 1955:36)."
5793,那么，人类学是否否认个体的存在呢？,"Does anthropology, then, deny the existence of the individual?"
5793,个体是否会被想象成是一个机器人，机械地顺从一位文化大师的命令呢？不会。,"Is the individual imagined to be a robot, mechanically following the dictates of a cultural master?"
5793,相反，个体被看做可以自由选择和行动。,"To the contrary, the individual is seen as free to choose and to act."
5793,但就像韦伯所强调的，行动总是意义上的，而意义则来自一个人的行动在其所处背景（包括文化背景）中的位置。,"But action is, as Max Weber emphasizes, always in terms of meaning; and meaning comes from placement of one's acts in contexts, including culture."
5793,对人类学来说，个体既不是机器人，也不是一个完全独立的任性的小神，而是一个文化个体——既自由存在，又具体表现出其置身其中的文化类型，在这一类型中，会投下他所处的特定的社会和历史时代的影子。,"For anthropology, the individual is neither a robot nor an entirely independent self-willed little god but is a cultural individual – existing in freedom but also embodying that cultural mold in which he is cast in his particular society and historical epoch."
5794,由于文化具有在音节清晰的语言表达中获得最重要表现的符号特性，它可以轻易而迅速地从一个人类有机体传送给另-个人类有机体；又由于文化要素便于传播，它也就成为一个连续统一体。古往今来，文化世代相传，并横向地从一个民族传递到另一个民族中去。,"Because of its symbolic character, which has its most important expression in articulate speech, culture is easily and readily transmitted from one human organism to another.Since its elements are readily transmitted culture becomes a continuum; it flows down through the ages from one generation to another and laterally from one people to another."
5794,文化过程还是一个积累的过程，新的成分时时地汇入文化流程之中，增大了其总量。,The culture process is also cumulative; new elements enter the stream from time to time and swell the total.
5795,在《数学现实的轨迹》和《乱伦的定义和禁制》这两章中，将对知识经验和社会经验这两个人类经验的主要部分，提供文化学解释方法的论证。,"""The Locus of Mathematical Reality"" and ""The Definition and Prohibition of Incest"" provide demonstrations of the technique of culturological interpretation of two major sectors of human experience, the intellectual and the social."
5795,"最后,在《人对文明的控制》一章中，将批判地考察原始的，然而仍是普遍存在着的人类中心主义哲学的一个显著表现。","Finally, ""Man's Control over Civilization"" critically examines a conspicuous expression of the primitive, but still popular and respectable, philosophy of anthropocentrism."
5795,自由意志与无限权力的幻觉，仍然象幕布一样罩在我们试图界定人与文化过程的关系并评估人的价值的种种努力之上。,The illusion of Free Will and Omnipotence still hangs like a pall over much of our attempt to define the relationship between Man and the Culture Process and to evaluate his role in it.
5796,寻食经济的最后的显著特点是，营地作为日常活动中心和食物分享实际发生地的重要性。,A final distinctive feature of the food-foraging economy is the importance of the camp as the center of daily activity and the place where food sharing actually occurs.
5796,在非人类的灵长目动物中，而且或许在人类祖先中，直到他们控制了火的使用，他们的活动场所才倾向于分为饮食区与睡眠区，而后者往往每夜更换。,"Among nonhuman primates, and probably among human ancestors until they controlled the use of fire, activities tend to be divided between feeding areas and sleeping areas, and the latter tend to be shifted each evening."
5796,然而，历史上著名的寻食民族生活于某种程度上永久的营地里，有朱瓦西人适应整个冬季的旱季营地，有哈扎人适合于最多几个星期的、以采集浆果和蜂蜜为目的的雨季营地。,"Historically known food-foraging people, however, live in camps of some permanence, ranging from the dry-season camps of the Juhoansi that serve for the entire winter to the wet-season camps of the Hadza, oriented to berry picking and honey collecting, that serve for a few weeks at most."
5797,我觉得若要理解人类的社会进程，就应该将“人文系数”这一概念引人我所采用的模式之中。,"I felt that I had to bring the ""humanistic coefficient"" into my model if I was to make sense of human social processes."
5797,恩登布人的村落社会生活中最不寻常的一个特点就是其经常爆发的冲突。,One of the most arresting properties of Ndembu social life in villages was its propensity toward conflict.
5797,恩登布人的村庄由不同的社区组成，每个社区又由二十多个有亲属关系的成员组成，不同的社区之间经常互起冲突。,Conflict was rife in the groups of two dozen or so kinsfolk who made up a village community.
5797,社区之间的紧张关系急剧增长在公众中展现为一连串的事件，我将这种展现称作“社会戏剧”，恩登布人的冲突就是通过“社会戏剧”来展示的。,"It manifested itself in public episodes of tensional irruption which I called ""social dramas.""Social dramas took place in what Kurt Lewin might have called ""aharmonic"" phases of the ongoing social process."
5798,这种新兴趣出现于女性主义政治学和认识论的重要关头：妇女的意识正在觉醒，经验正在分享。,It emerges from a crucial moment of feminist politics and epistemology: consciousness raising and the sharing of experiences by women.
5798,通过将彼此分离的生活联系在一起，共性得以产生，它赋予个人的行动以力量，承认共同的财富的存在，新近的女性主义意识的这个时刻在《尼萨》关干它自己的关系性寓言中被寓言化。,"A commonality is produced that, by bringing separate lives together, empowers personal action, recognizes a common estate.This moment of recent feminist consciousness is allegorized in Nisa's fable of its own relationality."
5798,（在其他民族志里，传统上关于主动人会（initiation)和插入（penetration）的传统男性化故事则上演了另一些关于自我与他者的寓意丰富的相遇。,"(In other ethnographies, traditionally masculine stories of initiation and penetration differently stage the productive encounter of self and other.)"
5798,）于是，肖斯塔克那明确的女性主义寓言反映了“妇女的”经验建构被置于舞台中心这一特殊时刻.,"Shostak's explicit feminist allegory thus reflects a specific moment in which the construction of ""woman's"" experience is given center stage."
5799,当今依然盛行的现代主义思潮中，沃尔夫的观点占统治地位。,The modernist strand alive today is the culmination of the Whorfian position.
5799,20 世纪 60 年代， 认知人类学的支持者继承了他的传统， 即关注现代西方科学和他们所研究的本土的世界观之间的关系。,"In the 1960s proponents of cognitive anthropology took up Whorf’s concern of the relation between modern, Western science and the indigenous worldviews they studied."
5799,"这些支持者把自己的研究领域称之为“民族科学""  ( ethnoscience ) 上这个术语没有明确指出其与“认知人类学” （当时的一些人也确实这样看这一学科）、”成分分析“（保留了其主要的方法）或是“新田野民族志” (the new ethnography,  20 世纪 60 年代杜撰的词，用来区分刘易斯• 宾福德的“新考古学"")的不同。","They called their field ‘ethnoscience’.That term did not always designate anything at all diVerent from ‘cognitive anthropology’ (which was how some still saw their enterprise), from ‘componential analysis’ (which remained their main methodology), or from ‘the new ethnography’ (a catchword coined in the 1960s to make the comparison between their work and ‘the new archaeology’ of Lewis Binford)."
5800,原住民对强加在他们身上的变化会做出很不一样的反应。,Reactions of indigenous peoples to changes forced upon them vary considerably.
5800,一些民族退缩到别人难以接近的地方去，希望能不被骚扰，而另外一些则陷入了一种冷漠的状态之中。,"Some have retreated to inaccessible places in hopes of being left alone, while some others have lapsed into apathy."
5800,有一些民族，比如特罗布里恩德岛民，他们通过将外族的习俗加以修改使其与本土的价值相符合，从而重申他们传统文化的价值。,"Some, such as the Trobriand Islanders, reassert their traditional culture's values by modifying foreign practices to conform to indigenous values, a phenomenon known as syncretism."
5800,如果一种文化的价值偏离现实太远，就可能出现复兴运动。一些复兴运动想要加速涵化的过程，以便从优势文化中获得更多的利益。,"If a culture's values get widely out of step with reality, revitalization movements may appear.Some revitalization movements try to speed up the acculturation process to get more of the benefits expected from the dominant culture."
5801,一旦新人回归社会（融入），他将受到庆典般的欢迎，就好像他死而复活一样。,"On his return to society (incorporation) the novice is welcomed with ceremonies, as though he had returned from the dead."
5801,这就提醒整个社会这个人有了新地位——人们可以期望他以某些特定的方式行为，而反过来，他们也必须以恰如其分的方式对待他。,This alerts the society at large to the individuaPs new status—that people can expect him to act in certain ways and in return they must act in the appropriate ways toward him.
5801,此人的新权利和责任因此便得到清楚界定。,The individua's new rights and duties are thus clearly defined.
5801,他就不会有——比如一一一个北美青少年会有的问题。青少年是一个人既非成人也非孩子的时期，其社会地位缺乏清晰界定。,"He is spared, for example, the problems of American teenagers, a time when an individual is neither adult nor child but a person whose status is ill defined."
5801,在刚才引述的这个澳大利亚的例子当中，男孩们不仅要准备成为成年人，而且要准备成为男人。,"In the Australian case just cited, boys are prepared not just for adulthood but also for manhood."
5801,比如，在他们的社会中，勇气和忍耐被认为是重要的男性美德，而敲落牙齿和割包皮的痛苦有助于在成年礼中灌输这东西。,"In their society, for example, fortitude is considered an important masculine virtue, and the pain of tooth-knocking or circumcision helps instill this in initiates."
5802,经过濡化，人们学会在社会上恰如其分地满足自己生物的需要。,Through enculturation one learns the socially appropriate way to satisfy one's biologically determined needs.
5802,重要的是区别如下的差异：并非习得的需要本身与习得的满足需会的方式。,"It is important to distinguish between the needs themselves, which are not learned, and the learned ways they are satisfied."
5802,因此，北美人认为睡得舒服的观念与日本人的观念有极大的不同。,"Thus, a North American's idea of a comfortable way to sleep will vary greatly from that of a Japanese."
5802,人的生物学的需要与其他动物的需要是相同的：除了吃和睡，它们还包括住、伴侣关系、自我防卫和性的满足每一种文化以自己的方式决定这些需要将如何得到满足。,"The biological needs of humans are the same as those of other animals: besides food and sleep, they include shelter, companionship, self-defense, and sexual gratification.Each culture determines in its own way how these needs will be met."
5802,并非所有习得的行为都是文化的。,Not all learned behavior is cultural.
5802,鸽子可能学会一些技巧，但是这种行为是反射的，是重复训练条件反射作用的结果，而不是濡化的结果。,"A pigeon may learn tricks, but this behavior is reflexive, the result of conditioning by repeated training, not the product of enculturation."
5803,另一类别的发嗓音是由语音修饰（vocal qualifiers）构成的。,Another category of vocalizations consists of vocal qualifiers.
5803,有一种比嗓音特征表露更短暂的音延，一般限于单个语调空隙里，而不是遍及整条短语。,"These are of briefer duration than vocal characterizers, limited generally to the space of a single intonation, rather than over whole phrases.They modify utterances in terms of intensity—loud versus soft; pitch—high versus low; and extent—drawl versus clipping."
5803,它们根据强度音的响亮与柔和、音调的高与低、迟缓与快速来修饰话语这些表示说话人对诸如“滚出去”这类特殊短语的态度。,"These indicate the speaker's attitude toward specific phrases, such as ""Get out!"""
5803,第三类别是由发声间隔（vocal segregates) 构成的。,The third category consists of vocal segregates.
5804,在关于世界音乐的性质上有着许多矛盾的观点。,There are conflicting views on the nature of world music.
5804,一些人认为，它代表了真正的部落音乐的商品化和商业化；西方的唱片公司只不过改编了非洲和亚洲的音乐去迎合已经审美疲劳的西方消费者，而在行动中已经破坏了它。,"Some argue that it represents a commodification and commercialisation of authentic tribal music; that the Western record companies have merely adapted African and Asian music to cater to the jaded palates of Western consumers, and have destroyed it in the act."
5804,另一方面，可以发现，那些“西方化的”艺术家，比如尤苏恩多尔（Youssou N'Dour）在非洲本地也是非常受欢迎的——那么，怎么能断定他们的记录是掺假的和“不真实的”呢？,"On the other hand, it could be pointed out that 'Westernised' artists such as Youssou N'Dour are also immensely popular in Africa itself – so how could their recordings be regarded as adulterated and 'inauthentic'?"
5805,在韦纳看来，互惠和交换常常可以看成是一种用来衬托相关人士最为关切的事情的表面现象，也就是等于保护和保存那些人们认为最能代表其身份的资产——即不可剥夺的财产。,"In Weiner's view, reciprocity and exchange can often be seen as surface phenomena that serve as a foil for the ultimate concern of the people concerned, which amount to the protection and preservation of assets that are felt to represent their very identity – that is, inalienable possessions."
5805,礼物具有社会整合功能，并且同时定义和再次确认个体之间的特定关系。,Gifts are socially integrating at the same time as they define and reconfirm specified relationships between individuals.
5805,而资本主义体系中的商品交换以一种不同的方式运作。,Commodity exchange in a capitalist system works in a different way.
5805,当你在超市买食品的时候，非常可能的是，过后你会想不起收银员的脸。,"When buying food at the supermarket, it is exceedingly likely that one will not remember the face of the cashier later."
5806,最后，甘柏兹和海姆斯的形式主义强调在编码过程中不可避免地会存在意义的流失（Rapport 1993a）。,"Finally, leavening the formalism in Gumperz and Hymes areapproaches which emphasize the inevitable loss of meaning in processes of codification (cf. Rapport 1993a)."
5806,贝特森提出，在外在世界和其象征符号之间，象征符号交流中的发送者和接收者之间，不可避免地存在一个“熵”或无序的过程。,"As Bateson argued, between the external world and its symbolization, and between the senders and receivers of symbolic communication, there is an inevitable process of ‘entropy’ or disordering."
5806,换句话说，任何试图以不同方式（把世界符号化或在两人中分享同一符号）言说同一事物，最终都可被视为在诉说不同事物（Hough 1969: 4）。,"In other words, any attempt to say the same thing in a different way (to symbolize the world, or have two people share the same symbol) can be seen ultimately to amount to saying a different thing (cf. Hough 1969:4)."
5807,根据“多元文化主义”观点，在大多数社会中，存在着一个占主导地位的，甚至是霸主地位的文化和一系列的少数者群体。,"In most societies, according to the ""multiculturalist"" approach, there is a dominant, even hegemonic, culture and a cluster of minority groups."
5807,问题是在为不同文化创造空间的时候，还要保持共同政体的概念。,The question is then to retain the concept of a common polity while making room for the different cultures.
5807,其他的观点认为，政体是由公民而不是由多个共同体组成的，国家不必去处理群体的事情，而应该处理公民自己的事情。,"The other approach considers that a polity is made of citizens, not of communities, and that the state should not deal with groups but with the citizens themselves."
5808,当我们考虑社会分层的起源时，必须考虑一些常见的倾向，比如对自己或对所属群体的声望的欲求。,"When considering the origin of social stratification, we must reckon with such common tendencies as the human desire for prestige, either for oneself or one's group."
5808,尽管这种冲动并不必然会引起互为亲属的个体或群体之间的地位分层，但有时候它会。,"Although the impulse need not result inevitably in the ranking of individuals or groups relative to one another, it sometimes may."
5808,在易洛魁和霍皮印第安人中，以及在谢伧特人和乌干达人中间，某些亲属世系群取得对另一些世系群的优势，在选举首领、举行神圣仪式和执行其他特殊任务的时候能被辨认出来，而无论成员是否有任何经济优势。,"Among the Iroquois and Hopi Indians and the Sherente and Ugandan peoples, the superiority of some kinship lineages over others is recognized by electing chiefs, performing sacred rituals, and other special tasks, whether or not membership entails any economic advantages."
5809,实际的情形是，人类学所采取的文化形式和社会关系都是个体化的且经过转化的：在个体生活的特定背景之下被赋予意义，变得鲜活起来。,"In use, the cultural forms and social relations of anthropology are personalized and transformed: given meaning, brought to life, within the particular contexts of individual lives."
5809,换句话说，人类学的写作也是自由流动的、评估性的，因为它既可以不周限于（限定于、取决干、 受控于）特定的田野经验，也不会被先前存在的学科流派限制住。,"In other words, anthropological writing is free-floating stock-taking too, for it can be bound (predicted, determined, encompassed) neither by the field experience nor by the disciplinary genres which preceded it."
5809,或许，它的高明可以用它在何种程度上重新书写二者来加以衡最：既“阐释”他者，又“拓展”这个学科。,"Its greatness, perhaps, can be measured by the extent to which it rewrites both: ""explains"" the other and ""extends"" the discipline."
5810,“社会关系网”这个术语近年来进入了许多社会的日常词汇之中。,"The term ""social network"" has in recent years entered the everyday vocabulary of many societies."
5810,在日常会话中，当人们谈到“我的社会关系网”时，它指的是围绕着自我而展开的一套关系。,"In day-to-day speech, it refers to an ego-centred set of relationships, as when people talk of ""my social network""."
5810,它也可以被用来指为了某个特定的目的而发生的一些关系，而不必以某个人为中心被组织起来。,"It may also be used to refer to a set of relationships activated for a particular end, without necessarily being organised around a single person."
5810,术语“社会关系网络”的分析意义因此与社会系统的意义发生联系；一般地，我们可能说一个关系网络是依赖个人而存在的，因此是一个不太持久的社会系统。,"The analytical meaning of the term ""social network"" is thus related to the meaning of social systems; generally, we may say that a network is a person-dependent and thus not very enduring social system."
5811,人类学是西方（至少是学术性提炼和发起）的一种民间话语，涉及若干概念：“社会”、“文化”、“阶级”、“社会化”、“角色”、“关系”、“社区”等等，因为这正展示了特定西方话语的历史性演变。家乡式人类学则意味着这些概念处于一个自我回归的过程，而绝非抵达认识论的高度可以被解构（解释并批判）。,"Anthropology is a folk discourse of the West (or, at least, an academically distilled and derived one), dealing with notions of ""society"", ""culture"", ""class"", ""socialization"", ""roles"", ""relationships"", ""community"" and so on, because this is how a certain Western discourse has historically developed.Anthropology at home can only mean a recycling of these notions in a tautological fashion, and in no wise reaching an epistemological position from which they could be deconstructed (explained and critiqued)."
5811,超越文化的话语、概念、分类、观念和类型的惟一路径就是借助其他话语，即在强烈的差异之间建立起充当介质的触点地带。,"The only way beyond cultural discourses, concepts, categories, notions and genres, is via other such discourses: by setting up a contact zone as a tertium quid between radical differences."
5812,无论如何，所有社会对于儿童和青少年的社会化都具有极大的重要性，儿童不仅要学习语言的不同范畴，他们还要学习何时与如何使用61语言。,"Children not only have to learn the categories of language, they also have to learn when and how to use it."
5812,此外，他们还要学会成千上万的点滴知识——行为举止的礼仪和规范，应该尊敬和崇拜谁，以及如何最终主动地支配和通向符合社会价值观的美好生活。,"In addition, they have to acquire thousands of little 60 Small Places, Large Issues bits and pieces of knowledge – manners and rules of conduct, whom to respect and whom to worship, and how eventually to manage on their own and lead a good life in accordance with the values of society."
5812,社会化是文化各范畴一代一代传承的主要途径；也就是说，它寻求某种文化的延续性。,"Socialisation is the chief way in which cultural categories are transferred from one generation to the next; in other words, it secures a certain cultural continuity."
5813,等级（caste）是一个特殊的社会阶级，在这个阶级中，成员地位是相当固定的，或者说是不可渗透的。,A caste is a particular kind of social class with a fairly fixed or impermeable membership.
5813,等级实行严格的内婚制，而且子女自动成为其父母那个等级的成员，经典的例子是印度的种姓制度。,"Castes are strongly endogamous, and offspring are automatically members of their parents' caste.he classic case is the caste system of India."
5813,在印度的种姓里，除了严格的内婚制和成员地位世袭之外，特定种姓还与具体职业相联系，与诸如饮食习惯和服饰风格等习俗相联系，以及与包含纯洁和不纯洁观念的各种仪式有关。,"Coupled with strict endogamy and membership by descent in Indian castes is an association of particular castes with specific occupations and customs, such as food habits and styles of dress, along with rituals involving notions of purity and impurity."
5813,数以千计的姓氏（也叫作扣化），组成四个指定的类别（即种姓，也叫作其中处于最高地位的是僧侣或者婆罗门宇宙秩序和普遍价值的承载者，具有最高的仪式纯洁性。,"The literally thousands of castes are organized into a hierarchy of four named categories, at the top of which are the priests or Brahmans, the bearers of universal order and values and of highest ritual purity."
5814,所有文化都共享某些基本的特点，研究这些特点可以阐明文化本身的性质和功能。,All cultures share certain basic characteristics; studying these sheds light on culture's nature and function.
5814,文化不可能没有社会而存在，社会是为了生存而相互依赖的有组织的人群。,Culture cannot exist without society: a group of people sharing a common homeland who are dependent on each other for survival.
5814,由规则支配的关系被称为社会结构。,Society is held together by relationships determined by social structure or social organization.
5814,,"It is possible to have a society, as do creatures such as ants and bees, without culture."
5814,社会结构使社会团结在一起在一种文化内部并非一切都是一致的。,All is not uniform within a culture.
5815,有迹象表明，社会科学理论时下正在经历着又一次转变， 转变的性质现在还不完全清楚，但似乎具有以下三个显著特征。,"There are signs that social science theory is currentlyexperiencing another fundamental shift, the nature of which is not entirely clear as yet, but which appears to be characterized by three prominent trends."
5815,第一，在后结构主义时代一直被视为是人类学特点的文化相对论视角不再令人满意，但是，有些人觉得文化相对论本身的价值远远超出其实用性（见Descola 1992:108)。,"First, there is dissatisfaction with the cultural relativist perspective which has characterized anthropology in thepost-structuralist era, but which, it is felt by some, has largely outlived its usefulness (see Descola 1992:108)."
5815,第二，在人 类学内部和人类学领域之外广泛地反对“笛卡儿主义”的割裂身与心、行与思、自然与文化的二分法，并将其视作是阻碍人类学理论发展的大敌。,
5815,,"Second, there is a widespread reaction, both within and outside anthropology, against the ‘Cartesian’ dualisms of mind-body, thought-action, nature-culture, which are seen as obstructing progress inanthropological theory."
5816,尽管人们普遍承认这个概念已成为英国社会人类学安身立命的部分，但是这个概念几乎没有受到来自专业内部的系统检验。,"Yet despite the general agreement with which this notion has been accepted as part of the self-definition of British social anthropology, it has received little systematic examination from within the profession."
5816,有点例外的是尼达姆的《信仰、语言和经验》（Needham 1972)—书。,"One partial exception is Rodney Needham's Belief, Language, and Experience (1972)."
5816,这是一部值得深入探讨的、复杂的学术著作。,"This is a complex, scholarly work that deserves extended treatment."
5816,不过在这里，我希望关注盖尔纳的“概念与社会”(Gellner 1970)这篇短文，它被相当广泛地用于英国大学本科课程，并且仍被一些流行的文集所收录。,"Here, however, I wish to concentrate on a shorter text, Ernest Gellner's ""Concepts and Society,"" which appears to be fairly widely used in undergraduate courses at British universities and is still available in several popular collections."
5816,因此，我打算用下一个部分来详细地考察那篇文章，然后阐明一些我后面部分讨论中的观点。,"I propose, therefore, to devote the next section to a detailed examination of that essay and then to take up some points that emerge from my discussion in the sections that follow."
5817,社会戏剧以及社会事业——以及其他类型的过程化单位——代表了社会事件的前后连贯性，如果一个观察者将这些事件加以回溯，便能发现它们的结构。,"Social dramas and social enterprises—as well as other kinds of processual units—represent sequences of social events, which, seen retrospectively by an observer, can be shown to have structure."
5817,这种“时间性”的结构不同于非时间性结构（包括“概念的”、“认知的”以及“句法的”结构），尽管认知过程本身是一种智力过程并具有程序性的特点，但时间性结构基本上按照时间的关系而非空间的关系来组织。,"Such ""temporal"" structure, unlike atemporal structure (including ""conceptual,"" ""cognitive,"" and ""syntactical"" structures), is organized primarily through relations in time rather than in space, though, of course, cognitive schemes are themselves the result of a mental process and have processual qualities."
5817,如果有人能像看动作片一样注意到社会过程并且能够仔细审视“静止”的部分——即一个社区中与社会过程并存的社会关系，那么他可能就会发现这些暂时性的结构既不完整也并非完美无缺，而是需要不断地进行调整。,"If one were able to arrest the social process as though it were a motion film and were then to examine the ""still,"" the coexisting social relations within a community, one would probably find that the temporary structures were incomplete, open-ended, unconsummated."
5818,这类社会习惯被认为是理所当然的，所以常被当成是天然存在的。,Most social conventions of this kind are taken for granted and are therefore frequently perceived as natural.
5818,这样，我们可以通过研究其他社会而了解一些关于我们自己的事情，最好是研究那些约定俗成的习惯与我们完全不同的社会。,"In this way, we may learn something about ourselves by studying other societies, where entirely different conventions are taken for granted."
5818,这些研究会提醒我们：大量关于我们的事实或多或少被我们想当然为天生的，其实却是由社会创造的。,"These studies remind us that a wealth of facts about ourselves, considered more or less innate or natural, are actually socially created."
5819,实证主义模型是理性的，但它的合理性是由观察者而不是行动员来确定的。,"The positivist model is rational, but it is rationality as defined by the observer rather than by the actor."
5819,事先确定你的假说、合理性和效率，决定了你的测试只与那些相关的数据相联系。,"Having defined your hypothesis, rationality and efficiency dictate that you limit your test to only those data that are relevant."
5819,相应地，你也就通过你的做法创造了这些数据。,"Accordingly, you create these data, manufacture them through your procedure."
5819,在心理学中，这一做法通常是实验；在社会学中，这一做法是调查问卷；在经济学中，这一做法则是各种各样的统计测量。,"In psychology, this procedure is typically the experiment; in sociology, the survey questionnaire; in economics, various kinds of statistical measurement."
5820,如果真是如此的话，文化由结构和无结构现实构成的看法提供了鉴别这种误传的方法，同时也提供了避免这种误传的希望。,"The acknowledgement that culture consists of both constructed and unconstructed reality provides both a way of identifying this misrepresentation, if such it is, and the prospect of avoiding it."
5820,以道格拉斯和伯尔德的论著为代表的分析类型似乎基于这样一个假说，即在所有文化中，现实社会中的非结构、“非隐喻化的”部分，以及用来描述其他事物的隐喻之源，都是相同的，即人类社会。,"The type of analysis characterized by the work of Douglas and Bird-David appears to be based on the assumption that the unconstructed, ""unmetaphorized"" sector of reality, the source of metaphors for describing other things, will be the same in every culture; it will always be human society."
5820,无法避免的是，基于这个假说的任何分析都会复制社会与自然之间的二分法，因为二分法是这个假说的起始点。,"It is inevitable that any analysis based on this assumption will reproduce the dichotomy between society and nature, since this is its starting point."
5820,然而，没有理由假定隐喻化和非隐喻化的东西在文化上比其他任何东西都变化小。,However there is no reason to suppose that what is and what is not metaphorized will be any less culturally variable than anything else.
5821,同样，在社会人类学中，我们会去那些我们期待能够发现我们感兴趣的东西的地方；而且每当我们询问设计好的小问题时，都是为了产生由我们各自的理论定位所要求的更大问题的证据。,"Likewise in social anthropology, we go to places where we expect to find things we are interested in; and once there we ask small questions designed to produce evidence for the larger questions posed by our respective theoretical orientations."
5821,例如，对性别和权力之间关系的兴趣可能会使我们去找一个性别差异很大的社区做调查。,"For example, an interest in relations between gender and power might take us to a community in which gender differentiation is strong."
5821,在这个个案中，我们可能会将我们的问题聚焦于阐明女性和男性个体如何采取措施，米提高或者保持各自的地位。,"In this case, we might focus our questions to elucidate how individual women and men pursue strategies for overcoming or maintaining their respective positions."
5822,哈佛的W.劳埃德˙沃纳发起了一系列重要的社区研究。沃纳曾经受教于艾尔弗雷德˙克罗伯和罗伯特˙洛伊，但他成了A.R.拉德克利夫-布朗的传人。,"An important series of community studies was launched at Harvard by W. Lloyd Warner, who had studied under Alfred Kroeber and Robert Lowie but became a protégé of A. R. Radcliffe-Brown."
5822,他在澳洲土著中完成了最初的田野调査，并于1929年到达哈佛后不久，在被其称作“扬基城”（Yankee City) 的马萨诸塞州的纽伯里波特（Newburyport)开始了一个长期项目。,"Having done his initial fieldwork among Australian aborigines, soon after coming to Harvard in 1929 Warner embarked on a long-term project in Newburyport, Massachusetts, which he called Yankee City."
5822,这一以美国的社会阶级为中心主题的项目产生了卷帙浩瀚的出版物 (例如：Warner and Lunt 1941，1942)并且带来了大量的衍生研究和反响。,"The project, whose central theme was social class in the United States, resulted in multivolume publications (e.g.,Warner and Lunt 1941, 1942) and spawned both offshoots and reactions."
5822,其中的一个衍生研究是康拉德˙阿伦斯伯格的研究，他将社区研究方法带到了爱尔兰，并创作出了欧洲第一本此类型的出版物 (Arensberg 1937)。,"One of the offshoots was the work of Conrad Arensberg, who took the community-study approach to Ireland, producing the first published work of this kind in Europe (1937)."
5823,社团的概念应该和部门的概念有所区别：一个部门的人是在分类的水平上具有某些共同之处，而不是以一个行动单位发挥功能。,The concept of the corporation must be distinguished from that of the category: a category of persons who have something in common at the level of classification without ever functioning as an acting unit.
5823,行动或动作的概念，通常可以被互动的概念置换。,"The concept of agency, or action, can usually be replaced by the concept of interaction."
5823,将人们进行互动的各个方面概念化会唤起我们对行动各方互相影响这一特征的注意，但大多数行动不只是直接针对其他行动者，而是会被他们之间的关系所塑造。,"Conceptualising whatever people are up to as interaction calls attention to the reciprocal character of agency, and most acts are not only directed towards other agents, but shaped by the relationship."
5823,社会人类学家所研究的最小实体不是个人，而是两个人之间的一种关系（Leach 1967）。,"The smallest entity studied by social anthropologists is not an individual, but a relationship between two (Leach 1967)."
5824,弗思（Firth 1951)是马林诺夫斯基以前的学生，他试图通过对社会结构和社会组织加以区别来解决这个问题。,"Raymond Firth (1951), a former student of Malinowski, tried to resolve this problem through proposing a distinction between social structure and social organisation."
5824,从这个视角看，结构是规则、习俗、身份和社会制度的既定模式。,"The structure, according to this perspective, is the established pattern of rules, customs, statuses and social institutions."
5824,另一方面，社会组织被定义为结构的动力学方面；换句话说，也就是人们实际所做的事：他们在结构框架以内的决定和行动模式。,"Social organisation, on the other hand, is defined as the dynamic aspect of structure; in other words, what people actually do: their decisions and patterns of action within the framework of the structure."
5824,这种区别类似于身份和角色之间的区别，比那种单纯依赖结构的理解更加体谅这个凌乱、没秩序的社会世界。,"This distinction is analogous to the distinction between status and role, and allows for a messier, less ordered social world than an exclusive reliance on a structural understanding would allow."
5825,实际上可以认为，不同环境里的身份政治，尽管有着重要的差别，都共有一些形式上的显著特点（Eriksen待出版的著作）以使比较可行。,"It can indeed be argued that identity politics in very different settings, in spite of important differences, share a number of formal traits (Eriksen in press) making comparison viable."
5825,最近印度民族主义的现象（van der Veer 1994）可以被用来阐明这一点。,The recent phenomenon of Hindu nationalism (van der Veer 1994) can be invoked to illustrate this.
5825,虽然印度教是一种古老的宗教，政治化的印度教却是最近才出现的。,"Although Hinduism is an old religion, politicised Hinduism is recent."
5825,印度教原教旨主义的想法，最早出现于1930年代，但是直到1980年代晚期才成为一种大众现象。,
5825,1990年代，印度民族主义者BJP（Bharatiya Janata Party或“印度人民党”）作为最有影响力的党派在印度出现，在其中，充满了关于印度国家性质的热烈争论。,
5825,问题：错译改1：实际上可以认为，不同环境里的身份政治，尽管有着重要的差别，都共有一些形式上的显著特点（Eriksen待出版的著作）以使比较可行。,
5825,最近印度民族主义的现象（van der Veer 1994）可以被用来阐明这一点。,
5825,虽然印度教是一种古老的宗教，政治化的印度教却是最近才出现的。印度教原教旨主义的想法，最早出现于1930年代，但是直到1980年代晚期才成为一种大众现象。,"The idea of hindutva, or Hindu-ness, first appeared in the 1930s, but became a mass phenomenon only in the late 1980s."
5825,1990年代，在一片关于印度国家性质的热烈争论中，印度民族主义BJP党派（Bharatiya Janata Party或“印度人民党”）作为最有影响力的党派在印度兴起。,"In the 1990s, the Hindu nationalist BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party or the ""Party of the Indian People"") emerged as the most influential party in India, amidst heated controversy over the nature of the Indian state."
5826,它们的大部分交流是通过特别的手势或姿势进行的。,Much of their communication occurs by kinesics—specific gestures and postures.
5826,确实，其中有些动作，如做鬼脸、亲吻、拥抱，实际上在今天的人类和类人猿中也普遍使用。,"Indeed, some of these, such as grimacing, kissing, and embracing, are in virtually universal use today among humans as well as apes."
5826,认识到手势交流对类人猿的重要性，心理学家艾伦和比阿特丽斯·加德纳开始教年幼的黑猩猩瓦休使用聋哑人用的北美式手势语，它是自那时起学会用手势示意的第一个黑猩猩（参见第三章的“原著学习”）黑猩猩掌握超过400个手势语词汇，就已证实它们自己能够把每一个手势从其原来所指物体迁移到其他相应的物体，甚至物体图像。,"Recognizing the importance of gestural communication to apes, psychologists Allen and Beatrice Gardner began teaching the American Sign Language, used by the deaf, to their young chimpanzee Washoe, the first of several who have since learned to sign.(See the Original Study in Chapter 3).With vocabularies of more than 400 signs, chimps have shown they can transfer each sign from its original referent to other appropriate objects and even pictures of objects."
5827,深描是克里福德·格尔茨（Clifford Geertz)引入人类学的一个概念。,Thick description is a concept introduced into anthropology by Clifford Geertz.
5827,在1973年的一篇文章《探描：通向文化的观解理论》中，他创立了这个理论，而最好的例证则出现在他1972年的文章《深度游戏：关于巴厘斗鸡的记录》中（这两篇文章都收录在《文化的解释> (1973) 中）。,"It is theorized in his 1973 essay, ""Thick Description: Toward an Interpretive Theory of Culture"", and perhaps best exemplified in his 1972 essay, ""Deep Play: Notes on the Balinese Cockfight"" (both appearing in The Interpretation of Cultures 1973)."
5827,这两篇文章迄今为止仍旧是后来人们所知道的“解释人类学”的核心文本，并在上世纪70年代以来人们对人类学的兴趣——从社会结构到意义——的广泛（如果有争议的）复兴中扮演了重要角色。,"The essays remain two of the central texts of what became known as ""interpretive anthropology"", and figure as part of a widespread (if controversial) refocusing of anthropological interest, since the 1970s, from social structure to meaning."
5828,西方的文本按照惯例都要附上作者名字。,Western texts conventionally come with authors attached.
5828,因此《拉科塔信仰与仪式》、《拉科塔社会》和《拉科塔神话》在沃克名下出版也许是不可避免的。,"Thus it is perhaps inevitable that Lakota Belief, Lakota Society, and Lakota Myth should be published under Walker's name."
5828,但当民族志复杂、多元的诗创造性质开始越来越明显——并负载政治意义——惯例开始在一些细小的方面有所松动。,"But as ethnography's complex, plural poesis becomes more apparent—and politically charged—conventions begin, in small ways, to slip."
5828,沃克的作品可能是合作文本的一个不寻常的例子，但它有助于我们看到幕后的情境一旦“被访人”开始被当作合著者，而民族志学者既是抄写员、档案保管员也是进行阐释的观察者，我们就能够对所有的民族志提出新的批评性问题。,"Walker's work may be an unusual case of textual collaboration.But it helps us see behind the scenes.Once ""informants"" begin to be considered as co-authors, and the ethnographer as scribe and archivist as well as interpreting observer, we can ask new, critical questions of all ethnographies."
5828,无论它们的形式具有多大的独白性、对话性或复调性，它们都是话语的等级制安排。,"However monological, dialogical, or polyphonic their form, they are hierarchical arrangements of discourses."
5829,在反对“东方主义”的相关争讼中，爱德华˙萨义德（Said 1978)指出了欧美人长久以来把东方和阿拉伯文化视觉化的那些比喻。东方就是一座剧场、一个舞台，上演着不变的剧目，供欧美人从一个特权位置观看。,"In a related polemic against ""Orientalism"" Edward Said (1978) identifies persistent tropes by which Europeans and Americans have visualized Eastern and Arab cultures.The Orient functions as a theater, a stage on which a performance is repeated, to be seen from a privileged standpoint."
5829,[巴尔特(Barthes 1977)指出了狄德罗的新兴布尔乔亚美学中存在着同样的“视角”。,"(Barthes [1977] locates a similar ""perspective"" in the emerging bourgeois esthetics of Diderot.)"
5829,]萨义德认为，东方被“文本化”了，它多层次和枝蔓丛生的故事和生存困境，被编织为一个条理清晰的符号体，适合于艺术品鉴赏家式的阅读。,"For Said, the Orient is ""textualized""; its multiple, divergent stories and existential predicaments are coherently woven as a body of signs susceptible of virtuoso reading."
5829,神秘、脆弱的东方，被外来学者的作品所抢救，仁慈地公之于世。,"This Orient, occulted and fragile, is brought lovingly to light, salvaged in the work of the outside scholar."
5829,如此这般的空间/时间运用（当然，并不只限于严格意义上的东方主义）的效果，就是授予他者一个孤立的身份，而给精明的观察者一个立足点，使他可以看而不被人看见/可以读而不被人打断。,"The effect of domination in such spatial/temporal deployments (not limited, of course, to Orientalism proper) is that they confer on the other a discrete identity, while also providing the knowing observer with a standpoint from which to see without being seen, to read without interruption."
5830,在这里卡特林从他（客观化的）隐喻的视角转向了受折磨者的视角，尽管有了这种转变，他的意图却不是现象学的，而是修辞学的：他既没有描述印第安人的也没有描述他自己的受折磨的经验。,"Here Catlin moves from his (objectifying) metaphorical perspective to that of the tortured; despite this move, his intention is not phenomenological, but rhetorical: He does not describe either the Indian's or his own experience of the torture."
5830,“看起来像小鬼和煞神的人”(在谁看来呢？卡特林？曼丹人？)在文体上正相当于“毫无逃脱的希望”。,"The ""imps and demons as they appear"" (to whom? to Catlin? to the Mandan?) is stylistically equivalent to ""there is no hope of escape from it."""
5830,他们被指点给读者，而正是读者的反应将确证卡特林的感觉。,"They are directed to the reader, and it is the reader's reaction that will guarantee Catlin's perceptions."
5830,在这些段落和他的《北美印第安人的举止、习惯和传统》全书中，卡特林的主要文体风格是生动叙述，它的目标是把他看到的一切经验都强烈地、栩栩如生地传达给读者，让他们无从怀疑这经验的真实性。,"In these passages and throughout his Manners, Customs, and Condilions of the North American Indians, Catlin's principal stylistic figure is hypotyposis.His aim is to impress his experience of what he has seen so strongly, so vividly, on his readers that they cannot doubt its veracity."
5830,恰恰是视觉带来了权威。,It is the visual that gives authority.
5831,像这样的数据说明，期望世界上大多数民族在最近的将来都达到像西方世界那样的生活水平，是不现实的。,"Figures such as this suggest it is not realistic to expect most peoples of the world to achieve a standard of living comparable to that of the Western world in the near future, if at all."
5831,至少，西方世界的国家将不得不大大削减他们的资源消耗。,"At the very least, the countries of the Western world would have to cut drastically their consumption of resources."
5831,到目前为止，他们都没有显示出愿意这样做的意思，而如果他们这样做了，他们的生活标准就不得不改变。,
5832,然而，生命巨链和进化理论之间存在两个重要差异。,"However, there are two important differences between the Great Chain of Being and the theory of evolution."
5832,第一，“进化”概念既包含时间方面，也包含空间方面：事物随着时间变化或 进化。,"First, the concept ‘evolution’ has a temporal as well as a spatial aspect: things change or evolve through time."
5832,第二，生命巨链的经典概念是以物种不变性理念为基础的，与之相反，在其生物形式上，进化论则依赖于相反概念，即物种的可变性。,"Secondly, whereas the classic notion of the Great Chain of Being was based on the idea of the fixity of species, the theory of evolution, in its biological form, depends on the contrary notion of the mutability of species."
5832,低等形式进化为高等形式。,Lower forms evolve into higher forms.
5833,正如我们在上文讨论民族生态学时指出的那样，对感知世界不同方式的研究一直受到建构主义文化模式的影响，人们通过认知过程来界定或赋予世界以意义。,"As indicated in the discussion of ethnoecology (above), the study of diverse ways of understanding the world has been informed by the constructivist model of culture, the view that people define or impose meaning on the world through cognitive processes."
5833,导致这种模式不适宜解释人类生态学的原因是其将环境简单地看作一种文化产物，这就意味着真正的非建构性的世界是不可知的或者至少是没有固有意义的（Ingold 1992a:39)。,"What makes this model unsuitable for human ecology is that it reduces the environment to a cultural construct; it implies that the real, unconstructed world is unknowable or at least has no inherent meaning (Ingold 1992a:39)."
5833,人类生态学关注人类群体与其环境互动的方式，但是，建构主义的文化模式却意味着人们之间的互动没有任何意义，我们所拥有的只是斯图尔德称作“出自文化的文化（culture comes from culture)的无结果假设” (Steward 1955:36)。,"Human ecology is concerned with the ways human populations interact with their environments, but the constructivist model of culture implies that there is nothing recognizable or meaningful for people to interact with, and leaves us with what Steward called ""the fruitless assumption that culture comes from culture"" (Steward 1955:36)."
5833,有人一直认为，感知与阐释之间的混淆是造成这一困境的根源。,It has been suggested that the root of this difficulty is a confusion between perception and interpretation.
5833,大多数人类学家谈论对环境的感知和阐释时，好像它们是某种现象，都是人们“建构”的。,"Most anthropologists refer to perceptions and interpretations of the environment as if they are phenomena of the same kind, both ""constructed""."
5834,有两种主要的方法处理自然-文化的关系。,There are two principal ways of approaching the nature–culture relationship.
5834,一方面，你可以研究自然和自然-文化关系在不同社会是如何被概念化的；另一方面，你可以调査自然（环境或人类天性）是如何影响社会和文化的。,"On the one hand, one may study how nature and the nature–culture relationship is conceptualised in different societies; on the other, one may investigate how nature (the environment or inborn characteristics of humans) affects society and culture."
5834,因此，自然既可以作为自然的文化表现而存在，也可以存在于文化和社会之外，但却影响到人类的生存方式。,"Nature thus exists both as cultural representations of nature and as something outside culture and society, yet influencing the ways in which humans live."
5834,作为一个生物物种，我们参与生态系统并且改变它们；作为文化产物，我们创立有关环境的概念并且将我们自己与之区分开来。,"As a biological species, we take part in ecosystems and modify them; as cultural beings, we develop concepts about our environment and place ourselves outside it."
5834,首先，社会生活由行动，或互动组成：如果人们停止互动，社会将不会存在。,"Above all, social life consists of action, or interaction: if people ceased to interact, society would no longer exist."
5835,也许在生物学及人类学领域，生态系统模式最重要的贡献在于，它推动了以整体论的方法研究环境中的生物体。,"Probably the most important contribution of the ecosystem model, both in biology and in anthropology, was the promotion of an holistic approach to the study of organisms in their environments."
5835,分析者将他们的注意力转向了生物体于其中的复合整体关系，而不是试图寻求造成特殊物质及行为特质的单一环境因素。,"Instead of seeking single environmental causes for specific physical and behavioural traits, analysts shifted their attention to the total complex of relationships in which organisms engage."
5835,在某种程度上，这一模式与对单一物种的研究大相径庭，因为整体模式强调的显然是非特殊性的物种；在分析中生态系统模式的作 用是解释有机物复合体与其他因素之关系的本质。,"There is, to some extent, incompatible with the study of a single species, since its emphasis is explicitly non-specific; its role in analysis is to elucidate the nature of relationships among a complex of organisms and other factors."
5835,只关注某单一物种，会有忽略生态学模式所提出的整体论观点的危险。,A focus on one species runs the risk of losing the holistic perspective which the ecosystem model provides
5836,多布森和厄科斯雷提出的激进环境决定论的特征就是反对将环境仅仅看作是供人类获益的一种资源。,Radical environmentalism of the kind identified by Dobson and Eckersley is thus characterized by an opposition to the use of the environment solely as a resource for human benefit.
5836,但是这种反对 也不是激进环境决定论所独有的，许多其他视角也持相同的态度，其中的一些甚至与“生态中心论”水火不容。,"But this opposition is shared by a number of perspectives, some of which, it has been argued, are fundamentally incompatible with ""ecocentrism""."
5836,为了分辨出激进环境决定论的本质特征，我们必须面对错综复杂、相互重叠例如，在工业社会中，反对环境仅仅是使人类获益的一种资源的观点往往是主张除人类之外其他动物的权利。,"In trying to identify the essential character of radical environmentalism, we are faced, as is to be expected given the nature of contemporary human culture, with a complex of seamlessly merging discourses and overlapping perspectives.For instance, within industrial societies, opposition to the view that the environment is a resource for purely human benefit has tended to be expressed most often through a concern for the rights of nonhuman animals."
5836,但是这种权利的范围也非常广，从不受虐待的权利到自在生活、完全不受人类干预的权利都包含其中。,
5837,很多现代人类学的著述醉心于结构、社会或思想上宏大的理论框架，直接废黜了日常生活的地位。,"In much of the modernist discourse of anthropology, where attention was focused upon grand theories of structure, society, or thought, there was a clear demotion of the status of the everyday."
5837,日常生活的地方，那些妇女在烹饪、孩子们在哭喊的单调场景，本身并不重要（Overing 1999)。,"The land of the daily life, that drab place where women cook and babies cry, was of no consequence (Overing 1999)."
5837,"相反，如今盛行的是探究日常经验中神话、诗歌和美学之间隐匿的关联(Witherspoon 1977；Brady 1991b； Guss 1989；Overing 1989, 1996b)。","In contrast, a prevalent stance today is to recognize the salient connection of myth, poetics and aesthetics to everyday lived experiences (e.g.Witherspoon 1977; Brady 1991b; Guss 1989; Overing 1989, 1996b)."
5838,在那次演讲中，他还间接提到了攫取异教徒的资源所能实现的经济利益。,In that same speech he also alluded to the economic benefits to be realized by seizing the resources of the infidels.
5838,尽管十字军东征被文饰为一次“圣战”，但它发动的动机显然超出宗教意识形态的范围。,"Although rationalized as a ""holy war"", the Crusades clearly were motivated by more than religious ideology."
5838,尽管欧洲人在“解放”圣地的战争中取得的不过是有限和暂时的胜利，但他们中的一些人确实从战场上得来的战利品中获益了，这就使他们相信：通过寻找和掠取他人的资源，人们可以过上比以前更好的生活。,"Although the Europeans never did ""liberate"" the Holy Land, at least some of them did benefit from the booty obtained in battle, lending credence to the idea people could live better than they had before by locating and seizing the resources of others."
5838,"因此，在公元1000年后数世纪在欧洲产生了国家形态,接着是欧洲人对世界其他地方的殖民扩张。","Thus, the state formation that occurred in Europe in the centuries after A.D. 1000 was followed by colonial expansion into other parts of the world."
5838,与国家发展和对外扩张相伴随的，是战争的技术和组织的发展。,Proceeding in concert with this growth and outward expansion was the development of the technology and organization of warfare.
5839,除了由国内生发出来的灵感，如萨林斯的结构主义历史学和来自英国的如吉登斯的思想之外，这些方法还大量地汲取了皮埃尔˙布尔迪厄作品中的思想，他的《实践理论纲要》一书于1977年翻译成英文。,"In addition to home-grown inspirations like Sahlins's structuralist history and British sources such as Giddens, these approaches drew heavily on the work of Pierre Bourdieu, whose Outline of a Theory of Practice was translated into English in 1977."
5839,他的关键概念（至少在人类学家看来）是有关“惯习”（habits) 的概念 ，这一概念是指日常生活中想当然的“禀性”，他将此归纳为“禀性的共同体”（a community of dispositions)。,"His key concept (at least as the anthropologists read him) was the notion of habitus, the taken-for-granted dispositions of daily life, which he summarized as ""a community of dispositions."""
5839,布尔迪厄逝世于2002年，他对美国人类学有着持续而强大的影响力。,"Bourdieu, who died in 2002, has had a continuing strong influence on American anthropology."
5840,对于亚马逊人来说，摄取亲戚的骨架（他者概念本身在亚马逊人中相当不明确），这一过程是顺理成章的，像雅诺马米人或是图皮纳巴人进食敌人尸体的碎片。,"For some Amazonian peoples the process must be literal, through the ingestion of the ground-up bones of a relative (otherness itself is a highly ambiguous state in Amazonia), as among the Yanomami, or the eating of a fragment of an enemy corpse as occurred among the Tupinamba."
5840,对他们来说，正是这一（我们眼中的）“食人习俗”建构了他们关于生命的理解（Overing 1996a）。,"For others, it is the idea of ‘cannibalism’ (at least from our point of view) that frames their understanding of human life (see Overing 1996a)."
5840,因此在结构内通婚（和陌生人通婚，使其在身体上和社会性上都被纳入到亲属体系中），如同食用肉和蔬菜（它们从此就成为人的一部分）。,"Thus to marry fits within this structure (one marries a stranger who becomes absorbed physically and socially as kin), as too does the eating of meat and vegetables (they both were human at the beginning of time)."
5841,而且，尚克曼发现，在食用对象的分类和备办的方法之间没有相关性（Harris 1979）。,"Shankman found, further, that there was no correlation between the categorisation of the eaten and the mode of preparation (Harris 1979)."
5841,为了捍卫列维-斯特劳斯，必须提到的是，人类学关于食人族的报告是不确定的，而且一般都是二手资料。,"It must be said, in defence of Lévi-Strauss, that anthropological reports of cannibalism are uncertain and tend to be second-hand."
5841,实际上，它们是如此的不确定，以致威廉·艾伦斯（William Arens）在《吃人神话》（The Man-Eating Myth，1978）中宣称，很可能，从来就没有存在过人吃人这样一种文化习俗。,"Indeed, they are so uncertain that William Arens, in The Man-Eating Myth (1978), argues that cannibalism has probably never existed as a cultural custom."
5841,他参考的所有资料都有着各种各样的弱点和矛盾之处。,All the sources he has consulted suffer from weaknesses and inconsistencies.
5842,关于原人日常饮食补充肉食的流行性质，有许多作品已写出来了，这些作品通常附有许多生动的关于“嗜杀成性者类人猿”的引文。,"Much has been written of a popular nature about the addition of meat to the hominine diet, often with numerous colorful references to ""killer apes""."
5842,这类引文完全是误导，不仅因为原人不是类人猿，而且也因为他们获取的肉食不是靠杀死活的动物，而是清理腐肉或甚至从其他食肉动物那里偷来肉食。,"Such references are quite misleading, not only because hominines are not apes but also because they obtained their meat not by killing live animals but by scavenging, or even by stealing it from other predators."
5842,有重要意义的是，南方古猿所具有的牙齿不太适合吃肉。,It is significant that teeth like those of australopithecines are poorly suited for meat eating.
5842,甚至黑猩猩，它的犬齿更大、更锋利，在撕裂其他动物皮时也经常遇到麻烦。,"Even chimpanzees, whose canine teeth are far larger and sharper, frequently have trouble tearing through the skin of other animals."
5843,在朱瓦西人中，妇女控制她们采集到的食物，而且能与她们选择的任何人分享。,"Among the Juhoansi, women have control over the food they collect and can share it with whomever they choose."
5843,相比之下，男子则受规定多少肉食应当分配以及分配给谁的规则的制约。,"Men, by contrast, are constrained by rules that specify how much meat is to be distributed and to whom."
5843,因此，狩猎者很少能有效地控制他们带回营地的肉食对单个狩猎者而言，肉食分享实际上是为将来储备食物的方法；他的慷慨一尽管看来可能是义务——使他对其他狩猎者的未来猎获物有一种要求权。,"Thus, a hunter has little effective control over the meat he brings into camp.For the individual hunter, meat sharing is really a way of storing it for the future; his generosity, obligatory chough it might be, gives him a claim on the future kills of other hunters."
5843,作为一种文化特质，在分配生存所必需的资源方面，食物分享具有明显的持续生存的价值。,"As a cultural trait, food sharing has the obvious survival value of distributing resources needed for subsistence."
5844,像次级氏族一样，氏族也是引人注目的公共活动场所。氏族拥有最重要的舞蹈场地和祖先崇拜堂。,"Like the subdan, the clan is an arena for dramatic public activities,The clan owns a main dance ground and an ancestral cult house."
5844,"在这些庆典中心,举行公众集会，强调群体统一，以对抗其他氏族。","At these ceremonial centers, public gatherings take place that emphasize the unity of the group as against other dans."
5844,萨克谢维斯基把这看作是一项基本策略，用来克服恩加人家庭的强烈独立性，在家里“每个人自己作决策”。,"Sackschewsky sees this as an essential tactic to overcome the fierce independence of Enga households, where ""each man makes his own decisions""."
5844,这种家庭独立性给头人造成难题，头人促进家庭之间的统一，在竞争激烈和危险的社会环境中，致力于增强氏族的力量。,"Such familistic independence creates problems for Big Men, who encourage interfemily unity in the effort to enhance the strength of their own dans in a fiercely competitive and dangerous social environment."
5845,虽然并不是每一个居住在努尔人的村子里的人都属于同一个宗族，每个村子大致上都对应于一个宗族，就像欧洲的民族国家大致对应于某个民族群体一样。,"Although not everyone who lives in a Nuer village belongs to the same clan, each village is associated with a clan in roughly the same way as European nation-states are associated with ethnic groups."
5845,在这些重叠的从属关系原则之外——父方的亲属制度和居住地点——每个努尔男人对他的同龄伙伴也具有一些义务，包括和他一起被启蒙的男人、他的姻亲（他自己和他的兄弟所娶对象的宗族的成员），还有可能的贸易搭档。,"In addition to these overlapping principles for belongingness – agnatic kinship and place of residence – each Nuer man has obligations towards his age mates; the men with whom he was initiated, as well as his affines (members of clans his siblings and himself have married into) and possible trade partners."
5845,这些交叉分割的纽带创造了不能被简化为单纯的同心圆的效忠的复杂系统，却也减低了不同家系之间的世仇的危险度。,"These cross-cutting ties, which create complex systems of loyalties that cannot be reduced to mere concentric circles, reduce the danger of feuds between lineages."
5846,例如，西部的阿贝那基人的猎手认为，动物和人一样是由肉体和灵魂组成的。,"Western Abenaki hunters, for example, thought animals, like humans, were composed of both a body and a personal spirit."
5846,虽然阿贝那基人猎杀动物来维持他们自己的生存，但他们明显意识到，动物应得到适当的尊重。,"Although Abenakis hunted and killed animals to sustain their own lives, they clearly recognized that animals were entitled to proper respect."
5846,因此，当猎人们杀掉海狸、麝鼠或者水禽之后，他们不能把这些动物的骨头扔进最近的垃圾坑里就完事。,"Thus, when beaver, muskrat, or waterfowl were killed, the hunters could not just toss their bones into the nearest garbage pit."
5846,“适当的尊重”要求他们把它们的骨头送回水里，并祈求该物种延续不绝。,"Proper respect required that their bones be returned to the water, with a request that the species be continued."
5846,这种态度可以被看成自然主义世界观的一部分。,Such attitudes may be referred to as part of a naturalistic worldview.
5847,不再有可以纵览全局、绘制人类生活方式图的地方（山顶），没有了阿基米德支点，可以从它出发再现全世界。,"There is no longer any place of overview (mountaintop) from which to map human ways of life, no Archimedian point from which to represent the world."
5847,山处于不断的运动之中，岛也一样：没有人能够毫不含糊地占有一个被圈住的文化世界，从那里开始向外的旅程并分析其他的文化。,"Mountains are in constant motion.So are islands: for one cannot occupy, unambiguously, a bounded cultural world from which to journey out and analyze other cultures."
5847,人类生活方式的相互影响、主宰、模仿、翻译和颠覆日益增长。,"Human ways of life increasingly influence, dominate, parody, translate, and subvert one another."
5847,文化分析总是陷于差异和权力的全球运动之中。,Cultural analysis is always enmeshed in global movements of difference and power.
5847,无论人们怎么定义，此处不严格地使用的“世界体系”一词，现在已把这个星球上的社会联系在一个共同的历史过程之中。,"However one defines it, and the phrase is here used loosely, a ""world system"" now links the planet's societies in a common historical process."
5848,他也告诫人们不要极度贬低民族主义或把世界主义吹捧成明明白白的解药。,"However, he also cautions against the absolute devaluation of nationalism or the elevation of cosmopolitanism as its unequivocal antidote."
5848,后者也许和伊格纳提夫的拔除民族主义的毒牙并使之无害的想法一样不现实。法恩留给读者的是不安的恐惧：两者都没有好命运,"This latter project may be no more unrealistic than Ignatieff's aspiration to draw the fangs of nationalism and render it benign, but Fine leaves the reader with the uneasy fear that both projects may be ill-fated."
5849,值得注意的是，里维尔的田野经验是关于亚马逊的土著民族，对他们来说，任何接近法律关系的事情都会作破例处理，按照文献中通常的讨论，接近世系和继嗣群秩序的事情也是一样。,"It is significant that Rivière’s fieldwork experience had been with indigenous peoples of Amazonia, for whom anything approaching a ‘jural’ relationship would be stretching the point, as too would be lineages and descent-group ordering as normally discussed in the literature."
5849,在亚马逊人中，很难发现集体占有土地的群体，社区老人也很难约束其他人。,"It was as difficult to find corporate land-holding groups among Amazonian people, as the elders who might rule them."
5849,不存在男人群体间交换女人的联姻关系。,Therewere no groups of men forming ties of alliance through the exchange of their women.
5850,阿兹特克社会结构分为三个主要阶级：贵族、平民和农奴。,"The Aztec social order was stratified into three main classes: nobles, commoners, and serfs."
5850,在贵族之中，性别不平等是最明显的，它们在世系群体系之外发挥作用，以土地和统治者从被征服民族中分配给他们的农奴为基础。,"The nobles, among whom gender inequality was most marked, operated outside the lineage system on the basis of land and serfs the ruler allotted them from conquered peoples."
5850,平民分成不同的世系群，他们依靠世系群得到土地。,The commoners were divided into lineages they were dependent on for land.
5850,在每个世系群内，个人的地位取决于他与开基袓血统关系的远近：与世系群开基袓关系比较近的人有较高的地位，那些与开基祖亲属关系比较疏远的人地位较低。,"Within each of these, individual status depended on the degree of descent from the founder: Those more closely related to the lineage founder had higher status than those whose kinship was more distant."
5850,在阿兹特克社会中的第三个阶级，包括依附于土地的农奴，以及被商人雇用为搬运工的脚夫。,The third class in Aztec society consisted of serfs bound to the land and porters merchants employed as carriers.
5851,下业社会的货币经济在劳动与消费之间含有两步的过程。,The money economy of industrial societies involves a two-step process between labor and consumption.
5851,劳动所得的货帀在它可直接消费之前必须转换为其他东西。,The money received for labor must be translated into something else before it is directly consumable.
5851,在没有这类交换媒介的社会中，劳动报酬通常是直接的。,"In societies with no such medium of exchange, the rewards for labor are usually direct."
5851,在家庭群体中的劳动者消费他们收获的东西，他们吃猎人或采集者带回家的东西，他们使用他们自己制怍的工具但是即使在没有正规交换媒介的地方，也进行某种形式的物品分配。,"The workers in a family group consume what they harvest, they eat what the hunter or gatherer brings home, and they use the tools they themselves make.But even where no formal exchange medium exists, some distribution of goods occurs."
5851,经济学家卡尔·波拉尼把分配物质产品的文化制度分为三种模式：互惠，再分配和市场交换。,"Karl Polanyi, an economist, classified the cultural systems of distributing material goods into three modes： reciprocity, redistribution, and market exchange."
5852,在卡保库人那里，养猪是复杂的事务。,"Among the Kapauku, pig breeding is a complex business."
5852,饲养许多头猪显然需要许多食物。,"Raising lots of pigs, obviously, requires a lot of food to feed them."
5852,食物主要是在园地里生长的甘薯。,This consists primarily of sweet potatoes grown in garden plots.
5853,虽然果实、其他植物食物和无脊椎动物构成黑猩猩和倭黑猩猩食物的绝大部分，但是它们都会杀死并吃掉小到中型的动物，这在灵长目动物中是有点独特的。,"Although fruits, other plant foods, and invertebrate animals constitute the bulk of the chimpanzee diet, chimps will kill and eat other small to medium-sized animals, an unusual behavior among primates."
5853,雌性黑猩猩偶尔狩猎，雄性则更加频繁地如此做。,"Although chimpanzee females sometimes hunt, males do so far more frequently."
5853,在狩猎时，它们可能花费多达两个小时监视、跟踪和追捕意向中的猎物。,"When hunting, they may spend up to 2 hours watching, following, and chasing intended prey."
5853,此外，与普通的灵长目动物每个动物寻找自己食物的惯常做法截然不同，狩猎通常包括捕获和杀死猎物的团队工作。,"Moreover, in contrast to the usual primate practice of each animal finding its own food, hunting among chimpanzees frequently involves teamwork to trap and kill prey."
5854,进一步说，简言之，书写使经验从推理中分离出来（Stock 1983:531)。,"To elaborate, briefly, writing entails the separating of experience from its ratiocination (Stock 1983: 531)."
5854,书写是对经验的经验，是“元经验”，是用符号形式对经验的深思熟虑的排序.并从中有意识提炼的“意义产品”。,"Writing is an experiencing of experience, a meta-experience; it is the considered ordering of experience in symbolic form, and the conscious production of meaning from it."
5854,从最完整的形式上来理解，书写是一种用符号反映经验，并赋予其意义的实践。,"Understood in its fullest form, writing is the practice of symbolically reflecting on, and making sense of, experience."
5855,双边亲属关系是西方、现代化进程中、以及很多寻食社会的特征，这种关系从父母双方同时溯源且认同双方宗亲。,"Bilateral descent, characteristic of Western, modernizing, and many food-foraging societies, is traced through both parents simultaneously and recognizes several ancestors."
5855,个体平等地与父母双方的所有亲属交往。,An individual is affiliated equally with all relatives on both the mother's and father's sides.
5855,如此大的一个群体从社会方面看是不切实际的，因而通常缩小为一个由父母双方的亲属组成的小圈子，叫作亲类。,Such a large group is socially impractical and is usually reduced to a small circle of paternal and maternal relatives called the kindred.
5856,双重继嗣为某些目的是母系继嗣，而为另一些目的又是父系继嗣。,Double descent is matrilineal for some purposes and patrilineal for others.
5856,两可继嗣具有某种灵活性，因为个体既可以选择附属于母亲的继嗣群体，又可以选择附属于父亲的继嗣群体。,Ambilineal descent provides a measure of flexibility in that an individual has the option of affiliating with either the mother's or father's descent group.
5856,继嗣群体通常楚高度结构化了的经济单位，为其成员提供援助和安全。,Descent groups are often highly structured economic units that provide aid and security to their members.
5856,它们还可能是宗教传统的宝库，它通过对共同袓先的崇拜增强群体团结。,"They also may be repositories of religious tradition, with group solidarity enhanced by worship of a common ancestor."
5856,世系群是法人继嗣群体，它由血缘亲属组成，他们与一个共同的祖先具有系谱联系。,A lineage is a corporate descent group made up of consanguineal kin who can trace their genealogical links to a common ancestor.
5857,最近两本黑人自传——作者分别为查尔斯˙明加斯（Charles Mingus)和玛丽塔˙戈尔登（Marita Golden)——发展了多重自我的观念并探讨了扮演替代性自我的现实限制。,Two recent black autobiographies by Charles Mingus and Marita Golden develop the notion of multiple selves and examine the reality constraints on enacting alternative selves.
5857,他们也讨论了用替代性自我挑战支配性霸权意识形态的问题，一个的方式是运用民族美学（因此在风格和内容上都是民族志式的），一个的方式是开创人类学一直许诺的双重焦点。,"They also explore the use of alternative selves to challenge dominant hegemonicideologies, the one by applying an ethnic aesthetic (thus bein g ethnographic in style as well as content), the other by pioneering the bifocality that anthropology has always promised."
5857,另一位黑人作家艾丽斯˙沃克（Alice Walker)注意到：“当我看着伊朗和古巴的人民，他们就像我的亲戚”（Bradley 1984：35 — 36)。,"Alice Walker, another black writer, notes: ""When I look at people in Iran and Cuba, they look like kin folk"" (Bradley 1984: 35 - 36 ) ."
5858,但是，刚果人的情况有一个奇怪的特点，和波利尼西亚人的首领权威不同，刚果人的政府似乎并没有剥削也没有压迫它的公民：而是忽视他们。,"However, the curious feature of the Congolese situation is that the state, unlike the Polynesian chiefdom, does not seem to exploit and oppress its citizens: it ignores them."
5858,还应该注意到，默许的顺从当然不是一个普遍现象。,It should also be noted that tacit acquiescence is certainly not a universal phenomenon.
5858,可能尤其在南部的和中部的美洲国家中，以建立一个更加公平的政治经济秩序为目标的社会运动和农民起义很常见，并且有时成功地改变了社会秩序和主导的权力关系（Gledhill 2000）。,"Perhaps especially in South and Central American countries, social movements and peasant revolts aiming at the establishment of a more just political and economic order have been common, and have sometimes been successful in changing the social order and dominant power relations (Gledhill 2000)."
5859,阿尔及利亚的情况向他表明法裔阿尔及利亚人与阿拉伯人群一样陷于冲突之中，这使得他在这件事情上既反对弗朗兹·法农（Franz Fanon）又反对法国左派。,"Algeria showed him that the pieds noirs, or French Algerians, were as much trapped within the conflict as the Arab population, which led him to oppose both Franz Fanon and the French left on the issue."
5859,这种态度以及他早期对斯大林主义在政治上的反对应该让我们意识到有必要对后来其他人试图声称他支持马克思主义这一情况采取谨慎的态度。不过阿尔及利亚的情况对他也许也是社会加诸个体能动性之上的约束力的一种早期展示。,"This and his early political opposition to Stalinism should signify a need for caution regarding others’ later attempts to claim him for Marxism, but Algeria was perhaps also an early demonstration to him of the social constraints on individual agency."
5860,将相异性概念引入人类学，这本身反映出学科如今对自身历史和其独特的科学客观化进程中的种种不公正之处的清醒认识。,"The incorporation of the concept of alterity into anthropology itself reflects a strong contemporary awareness within the discipline of the iniquities of its past, its own particular programme of scientific objectification."
5860,它必须面对将他者建构进现代性视野时自己的中心主义（di Leonardo 1998)。,It must face its own centrality in the provision of constructions of otherness central to the vision of modernity (cf. di Leonardo 1998).
5860,由于失去了清白，如今人类学处于一个“自我反思的时代”，在批判后现代的宏大叙事时往往掺合进其他后现代的声音。,"Having lost its innocence, anthropology is now in an ""age of self-reflection"", a process through which it often joins other post-colonial voices in a critique of the grand narratives of modernism."
5861,这一论断表明民族志作者中业已形成一种惯习，即将民族志写作定义为高于和对立于旧有的不太专业化的写作体裁，诸如游记（travel books) 、个人回忆录、报刊文章，以及传教士、移民和殖民地官员等人的记述。,"The statement is symptomatic of a well-established habit among ethnographers of defining ethnographic writing over and against older, less specialized genres, such as travel books, personal memoirs, journalism, and accounts by missionaries, settlers, colonial officials, and the like."
5861,虽然专业的民族志并不会取代所有这些体裁，但被认为将夺取后者的权威地位并纠正它们的滥用。,"Although it will not supplant these genres altogether, professional ethnography, it is understood, will usurp their authority and correct their abuses."
5861,在几乎所有的民族志中，被称为“单纯的旅行者”、“随意的观察者”等漫不经心的人物时不时地出现，结果只是让严肃的科学家来纠正或证实他们认识上的肤浅。,"In almost any ethnography dull-looking figures called ""mere travelers"" or ""casual observers"" show up from time to time, only to have their superficial perceptions either corrected or corroborated by the serious scientist."
5862,体质人类学的另一个主要专业是对现今人类变异的研究。,Another major concern of physical anthropology is the study of present-day human variation.
5862,虽然我们是单个 人种的全部成员，但我们还是在明显或不那么明显的许多方面各不相同。,"Although we are all members of a single species, we differ from each other in many obvious and not so obvious ways."
5862,我们不仅在诸如肤色或鼻子形扰等可见特质方面不同，而且也在我们的血型和我们对某 种疾病易感性等生物化学的遗传因子方面不同。,We differ not only in such visible traits as the color of our skins and the shape of our noses but also in such biochemical factors as our blood types and our susceptibility to certain diseases.
5862,为了达到对人类变异以及这种变异与人们生活于其中的不同环境相关方式的更为全面的理解，体质人类学家应用所有现代分子生物学技术。,The physical anthropologist applies all the techniques of modern molecular biology to achieve a fuller understanding of human variation and the ways it relates to the different environments people have lived in.
5863,随着人类学和世界进入新千年，两者都已发生了改变——这些改变可能会像某些人宣称的那样并不具有根本性，但却无疑是重要的。,"As Anthropology and the world have moved toward and into the new millennium, both have changed, not so radically, perhaps, as some would announce but nonetheless importantly."
5863,这一修订版就是为了回应那些改变，同时依然保留了那些贯穿人类学发展历程中非常重要的关注和概念。,This revised edition responds to those changes while retaining concerns and concepts which remain salient throughout Anthropology's first century and into the present.
5863,三个这样持续不变的关注就是文化、田野工作和相关性。,"Three of these abiding foci are culture, fieldwork, and relevance."
5864,与那位历史学家所描绘的富尼埃形成对照的是，埃文思-普里査德在评论他在 “引言”中对于田野工作难忘的记叙时，用下述谦逊的说法来袒露自己对于努尔人的知识：“我居住在努尔人中的全部时间大概是一年。我认为一年的时间并不足以去对一个民族进行社会学的研究，对于一个处在满是敌意的环境中的棘手的民族来说更是如此。面1935年的远征历程和1936年的远征历程都是因为严重的疾病过早地结束了调查，（第14页)埃文思-普里査德没有炫耀地展示他的成功，而是以平实描述不断反复的田园牧歌式的幕同插曲的方式断断续续地叙述他的田野作业。,"In contrast with the historian's portrait of Fournier, Evans-Pritchard comments on his memorable introductory fieldwork account by making the following modest claim for his knowledge of the Nuer: ""My total residence among the Nuer was thus about a year. I do not consider a year adequate time in which to make a sociological study of a people, especially of a difficult people in adverse circumstances, but serious sickness on both the 1935 and 1936 expeditions closed investigations prematurely"" (14).Rather than parade his successes, Evans-Pritchard punctuates his fieldwork narrative by flatly describing repeatedly ruined bucolic interludes."
5865,在努尔人中争端频繁，就像在其他有相似组织的民族中一样，在分支世系群制度下，它们可能导致广泛的世仇。,"Disputes among the Nuer are frequent, as they are among other groups with similar organization, and under the segmentary lineage system, they can lead to widespread feuds."
5865,“豹皮首领”的行动使这种社会分裂可能的根源最小化。,This possible source of social disruption is minimized by the actions of the ritual conciliation office.
5865,“豹皮首领”不是真正的首领，他是调解仪式职位的承担者。豹皮酋领没有政治权力，并且被视为身于世系群网络之外。,The leopard-skin chief has no political power and is viewed as standing outside the lineage network.
5865,他所能做的一切，就是努力说服结怨的世系群接受用“血牛”偿还，而不是再夺一个人的性命。,All he can do is try to persuade feuding lineages to accept payment in blood cattle rather than taking another life.
5865,他的调解给每一方一个体面的让步机会以免太多人被杀死；但如果参与方为了某种原因而不愿意妥协的话，那么豹皮首领是无权强加给他们一个协议的。,"His mediation gives each side the chance to back down gracefully before too many people are killed; but if the participants are for some reason unwilling to compromise, the leopard-skin chief has no authority to enforce a settlement."
5866,调整机制在那些不允许财产权威胁平等社会秩序的社区中存在，就如在墨西哥髙原和危地马拉的许多玛雅人村落和市镇中那样。,"Leveling mechanisms are found in communities where property must not be allowed to threaten a more-or-less egalitarian social order, as in many Maya villages and towns in the highlands of Mexico and Guatemala."
5866,在这些社区中，重负体制的功能是抽出人们可能积累的任何过多的财富。,"In these communities, cargo systems function to siphon off any excess wealth people may accumulate."
5866,重负体制是一种公民宗教等级制度，在轮流的基础上，它把大部分社区的公职和礼仪职务结合起来。,"A cargo system is a civilreligious hierarchy, which, on a revolving basis, combines most of a community's civic and ceremonial offices."
5866,所有职务都向所有人开放，最终每个人实际上至少任一个职务一期，每一任期延续一年。,"All offices are open to all men, and eventually virtually every man has at least one term in office, each term lasting for 1 year."
5866,这一等级制度是金字塔形的，这就是说在比较低的层次上有比较多的职位，向顶端职位逐级递减。,"The scale is pyramidal, which means more offices exist at the lower levels, with progressively fewer toward the top."
5867,跳蚤市场也提出关于止式的和非正式的市场经济部门的问题。,Flea markets also raise the issue of the distinction between the informal and formal sectors of the market economy.
5867,非正式经济（informal economy）可以被定义为：商品生产者和服务提供者以种种理由逃避政府控制（编目、管理或其他种类的公众监督或审计供应可出售商品的体制）。,"The informal economy may be defined as the system whereby producers of goods and services provide marketable commodities that for various reasons escape enumeration, regulation, or other type of public monitoring or auditing."
5867,这类做法可能包罗差不多各个方面：供应市场的菜蔬和花果、制作和销售啤酒或含酒精的饮料、从事维修或建筑工作、乞讨、在街上兜售商品、从事礼仪服务、贷款、贩卖毒品、扒窃以及赌博等等，这里只提到一小部分。,"Such enterprises may encompass just about anything： market gardening, making and selling beer or other alcoholic beverages, doing repair or construction work, begging, selling things on the street, performing ritual services lending money, dealing drugs, picking pockets, and gambling, to mention just a few."
5868,人类最独特的特征或许是说话能力。,Perhaps the most distinctive feature of humanity is the ability to speak.
5868,不单人类使用符号交流。,Humans are not alone in the use of symbolic communication.
5868,许多研究业已表明，其他一些动物——特别是类人猿一-以声音和姿势可以起到类似于人类言语的作用；然而没有任何其他动物形成像人类所具有的那么复杂的符号交流系统。,Studies have shown that the sounds and gestures some other animals make—especially apes—may serve functions comparable to those of human speech； yet no other animal has developed a system of symbolic communication as complex as that of humans.
5868,归根到底，语言使人类能够保留其文化并使它代代相传。,"Ultimately, language is what allows people to preserve and transmit their culture from generation to generation."
5868,研究人类语言的文化人类学分支学科被称为语言人类学(Linguistic Anthropology)。,The branch of cultural anthropology that studies human languages is called linguistic anthropology.
5868,语言学家可能从事于语言描述(句子形成或动词词形变化的方式)或者语言历史(随时间推移语言的发展和相互变化的情况)的研究。,Linguists may deal with the description of a language (the way a sentence is formed or a verb conjugated) or with the history of languages (the way languages develop and influence each other with the passage of rime).
5869,从结构主义的角度看，所谓的“同感”是毫无道理的，因为它被排斥在日常分类标准之外且无法分类。,"From the point of view of the structural, such communitas appeared anarchic because it was marginal and unclassifiable in terms of everyday criteria."
5869,可是这两种形式的人类关系对保持社会延续性来说都是必需的，同样人们也需要在两种经验状态中做出选择。,"And yet, both modalities of human relationship were necessary for societal continuity; equally, individuals needed to alternate between the two experiential states."
5869,“同感”的创造性力量引领着个体和社会进行可能的革新，而将这些创造性的力量规制到各种类别与关系的规范中去的过程，在清算传统与发起新行动之间提供了一个稳定的传导机制。,"For, the creative power of communitas fashioned the being of individuals and communities in liberating, potentiating ways, while the routinization of this creative togetherness into normgoverned distinctions and relations afforded a stability conducive to taking stock and taking action."
5870,另一方面，还存在一种人类学的观点，认为所有的文化行为都是间生性的，都是文化同化的产物。,"On the other hand, there is an anthropological view that sees all cultural activity as belonging to hybridity, as being a product of cultural assimilation."
5870,换句话说，由于人们一直在交换、改变、加工、合并文化元素，从来就不曾存在过“确定类型”或“纯粹系统”这样的东西。,"In other words, there has never been such a thing as an ‘authentic type’, or a ‘pure system’, for people are always exchanging, changing, processing, incorporating, elements of culture."
5870,从这个角度得出的主张是我们一直都是间生物。,From this perspective the position is that we have all always been hybrids.
5871,然后，她接着讨论当代西方社会中的身体毁损（文身，等等）、易性癖和同性恋，将它们视为然后，她接着讨论当代西方社会中的身体毁损（文身，等等）、易性癖和同性恋，将它们视为对这种“二元形式”或男性/女性对比的挑战。,"She then goes on to discuss body mutilation (tattooing, etc.) in contemporary Western societies, transsexualism and homosexuality as practices that seem to pose a serious challenge to this ""binary form"" or male/female contrast."
5871,在许多社会，反复被指出的是，同性恋的男人被归类为是一种“中间的”性别——既非完全的男性，也非完全的女性，并且在许多社会（包括毛里求斯），有着一种广泛的观念，认为女同性恋者从生物学上说多少与异性恋的女性有些不同。,"It has time and again been shown that gay men are, in many societies, classified as an ""intermediate"" gender – neither wholly male nor wholly female, and in many societies (including Mauritius) there is a widespread notion that lesbians are somehow biologically different from heterosexual women."
5871,在所谓的“酷儿理论（queer theory）”这一新兴研究领域中，这种逻辑运用到极致，因为生殖器、性别身份、性身份和性之间的关系都是被问题化的。,"In the emergent field of inquiry known as ""queer theory"", this kind of reasoning is developed to great sophistication, in that the relationship between genitals, gender identity, sexual identity and sexual practices is problematised."
5872,社区是社会科学中最广泛和最经常运用的概念之一。,The concept of community has been one of the widest and most frequently used in social science.
5872,与此同时，关于这一概念的精确定义尚未确定。,At the same time a precise definition of the term has proved elusive.
5872,在那些较为有名的定义中就有罗伯特·雷德菲尔德（Robert Redfield 1960: 4）对此的定义，他认为社区具有四个基本特征：社会范围的小规模；成员思想状态和行动的同质性；在广泛的需求范围和时间内自给自足；对自身特点的清醒认识。,"Among the more renowned attempts remains that of Robert Redfield (1960:4), who identified four key qualities in community: a smallness of social scale; a homogeneity of activities and states of mind of members; a self-sufficiency across a broad range of needs and through time; and a consciousness of distinctiveness."
5873,这些人、就如20世纪的许多其他人一样，都试图逃避政治。,"These men, like so many others in the twentieth century, were trying to escape from politics."
5873,然而，这并不意味着他们漠视权力的关系，远非如此。,"This did not mean, however, that they were unconcerne d with power relationships.Far from it."
5873,他们的目标，也就是一种专家政治的自我殖民，发展出了一种崭新的权力关系的形式，其中“良性的”社会、经济与文化关系得到展现。,"Their goal, a kind of technocratic self-colonization, was to develop a new form of power relations where ""healthy"" social, economic, and cultural relations could unfold."
5873,要想整合进这一图景之中，就需要发明出一种新的统怀，由此能够使（对他们而言的）法国致命的颓废以及个体主义的倾向得到重新塑造。,Integral in this scheme was the need to invent a new governmentality through which the (to them) fatally decadent and individualistic tendencies of the French could be reshaped.
5873,为了将此付诸实施，他们对一种现代秩序与技术的新的表征都给予了建构和明确的表述。,They constructed and articulated both new representations of a modern order and technologies for its implementation.
5873,这些表征就是现代的社会事实。,These representations are modern social facts.
5874,很显然，黑人男子还不能被纳入政体，牙买加只是一块殖民地，还不是一个国家。我所要说明的是，不考虑性别和殖民地因素，就不能理解不列颠民族形成的关键时刻。,"Black men were clearly not ready to constitute a body politic, Jamaica was a colony, not a nation.Critical moments in the construction of the British nation, I am suggesting, cannot be made sense of outside the gendered and colonial context."
5874,议会成员在考虑女人的和男人的投票权时，也捎上了牙买加，这些都是有关的讨论，“民族”从帝国那里获得了具体的和特别的意义。,"Members of Parliament debated Jamaica alongside women's suffrage and men's suffrage – it was all part of a related discussion, and ""nation"" derived its particular and concrete meanings from ""empire""."
5875,在血统的父系原则之外，居住模式也是婚后从夫居，意思是新婚夫妇要住在男方的家里或至少住在他的吉那里。,"In addition to the patrilineal principle of descent, the pattern of residence is virilocal.This means that the newly married settle in the man's household or at least in his ginna."
5875,通过这种方式，所有最重要的资源都由多贡的男人所控制——土地权利、政治、孩子们和亲戚们——在同一个地理范围内集中。,"In this way, all of the most important resources controlled by the Dogon men – land rights, politics, children and relatives – are concentrated in the same geographical place."
5875,系统看起来对男人最有利，他们掌握了最重要的资源。,"The system seems to be most beneficial to the men, who control the most important resources."
5875,父系和从夫居的社会里，妇女是局外人并常常伴随着危险：在有些非洲社会，她们很容易被控告为有巫术。,Women in patrilineal and virilocal societies are outsiders and are often associated with danger; in some African societies they are prone to be accused of witchcraft.
5875,她们自己的父系亲属可能在另一个遥远的村子里，某种意义上，她们整个的婚姻生活是在一群陌生人中间度过。,"Their own agnates may be far away in a different village, and in a certain sense they live among strangers throughout their married lives."
5875,因此已婚妇女相当于对家系内聚力的威胁，因为她们是这个社群的外来人。,"Married women thus represent a threat to the cohesion of the lineage, since they are strangers within the community."
5875,这使我们联想到在第四章提到过的，家户和家系之间存在的潜在冲突。,"This reminds us of the potential conflict, mentioned in Chapter 4, between the household and the lineage."
5876,然而，由于合法的性伴侣可能在某人自己的社区内寻觅到，所以一般也实行村落内婚制，尽管这不是强制性的。,"However, since eligible sex partners are to be found within one's own community, village endogamy, though not obligatory, is commonly practiced."
5876,饶有兴趣的是，外婚制包括或不包括哪些亲戚，在不同的社会有很大的差异。,"Interestingly, a wide variety exists among societies as to which relatives are or are not covered by exogamy rules."
5876,"例如,天主敎会一直禁止第一级的堂表兄弟姐妹之间的婚姻，而这样的婚姻在美国的31个州是非法的。在其他19个州，这类婚姻不是非法的，在欧洲也不是非法的。","In Europe, for example, the Catholic Church has long had a prohibition on marriages to first cousins, and in the 19th century such marriages were illegal in most of the United States."
5876,"此外，在其他许多社会，第一级堂表兄弟姐妹是优先选取的配偶。尽管有相反的虚构信念,但第一级堂表兄弟姐妹结婚生的孩子没有很大的风险。在19世纪，爱德华˙泰勒爵士提出一个命题：对于近亲交配的抉择是：“在外嫁娶，或者灭绝”。","In numerous other societies, however, first cousins are preferred spouses.In the 19th century, Sir Edward Tylor advanced a proposition that alternatives to inbreeding were either ""marrying out or being killed out""."
5877,一个稍显粗糙但却长期存在并且相当有用的类形学，建立在生存方式的基础之上：例如，狩猎、采集、畜牧、农业和工业。,"A crude but long-standing and rather useful typology is based on mode of subsistence: hunting and gathering, herding, farming, industry, for example."
5877,然后当社会及文化特质与这些生存方式中的一个或其他共同发生时，它们就会被注意到。,Social and cultural traits are then noted when they commonly occur in association with one or the other of these modes of subsistence.
5877,例如，大一统的国家官僚，主要出现在食物增长或工业社会，而不是在那些单纯依靠狩猎和采集的社会。,"For example, centralized state bureaucracy is found primarily in foodgrowing or industrial societies, not in those relying solely on hunting and gathering."
5878,这些描述不那么套式化，具有相对感，一个原因是，他们都关注文本技巧的无效性（ineffectiveness)——也就是対这些技巧有意识的使用：移情、梦的转译、讲故事、多声音和多视角、突出幽默的颠覆和多个身份/传统/文化的辩证并置，以及对覇权话语的批评。,"One of the reasons for the relative sense that these portraits are less stereotyped is their attention to the ineffectiveness of textual techniques—that is, the self-conscious employment of such devices as transference, dream-translation, talk-story, multiple voices and perspectives, the highlighting of humorous inversions and dialectical juxtaposition of identities/traditions/cultures, and the critique of hegemonic discourses."
5878,在流行术语行话的今天，他们展示了后现代主义知识的文本间性、交互参照和跨语言形态。,"In the fashionable jargon of the day, they illustrate intertextuality, inter-reference, and the interlinguistic modalities of post-modernist knowledge."
5878,在实践的层面，这样的自我意识和高超技巧能重振民族志作品的活力，而后者再一次可以完成人类学的文化批评承诺：让人意识到那些被理所当然地接受下来的方式其实是社会文化的建构，而对此我们可以行使自己的职责。,"On the practical level, such selfconscious and virtuoso technique could contribute to a reinvigorated ethnographic literature, one that can again fulfill the anthropological promise of cultural criticism: of making our taken-for-granted ways recognizable as sociocultural constructions for which we can exercise responsibility."
5879,族群归属只是20世纪晚期更一般的文化动力学模式的一个领域或一个样本。,"Ethnicity is merely one domain, or one exemplar, of a more general pattern of cultural dynamics in the late twentieth century."
5879,少数族群的自传写作相应于当代关于文本性、知识和文化的理论，是后者的镜子和例证。,"Ethnic autobiographical writing parallels, mirrors, and exemplifies contemporary theories of textuality, of knowledge, and of culture."
5879,两种写作形式都提示了文化批评的强有力样式。,Both forms of writing suggest powerful modes of cultural criticism.
5879,它们是后现代的，这在于它们采用了如下一系列技法：双重焦点或视点互换，多重现实的并置。文本间性和交互参照，通过家族相似进行比较。,"They are post-modern in their deployment of a series of techniques: bifocality or reciprocity of perspectives, juxtapositioning of multiple realities, intertextuality and inter-referentiality, and comparison through families of resemblance."
5879,在当今文化间的对话和冲突的可能性都在不断增加的时代，民族志写作可能会从既处理族群归属又处理文本性、知识和文化的作家那里获得教益。,"Insofar as the present age is one of increasing potentialities for dialogue, as well as conflict, among cultures, lessons for writing ethnography may bé taken from writers both on ethnicity and on textuality, knowledge, and culture."
5880,从博厄斯到格尔茨，美国人类学对文化一直有一种持久的、抽象的兴趣。不过，格尔茨避免采用静态抽象而转向更动态的研究。,Culture was the abiding abstract interest of American anthropology from Boas to Geertz (with the latter steering clear of static abstraction in favour of a more dynamic approach).
5880,但对“文化”到底是什么，却总是没有一致的看法。,This does not mean that there has always been uniformity about what ‘culture’ is.
5881,文化变迁包括创新、传播、文化遗失和涵化。,"The mechanisms involved in cultural change are innovation, diffusion, cultural loss, and acculturation."
5881,变迁的最终来源是通过创新：一些新的做法、工具或原理。,"The ultimate source of change is innovation: a new practice, tool, or principle."
5881,其他个人接受这一创新，于是它就变成社会分享的了。,"Other individuals adopt the innovation, and it becomes socially shared."
5881,首次创新是对一些新原理的偶然发现——例如黏士经火焙烧能够变得永久坚硬这一发现。,"Primary innovations are chance discoveries of new principles—for example, the discovery that the firing of clay makes the material permanently hard."
5881,二次创新是通过对已知原理的应用而带来的改进——例如，用已知的技术将黏土烧铸成人们所熟悉的物体。,"Secondary innovations are improvements made by applying known principles—for example, modeling the clay to be fired by known techniques into familiar objects."
5881,首次创新可以促进快速的文化变迁，并激发其他发明。,Primary innovations may prompt rapid cultural change and stimulate other inventions.
5881,一种创新被接受的机会，部分地（而非全部地)取决于它相对于自己将要取代的那种方法或物体的明显可见的优越性。,"An innovation's chance of acceptance depends partly, but not entirely, on its perceived superiority to the method or object it replaces."
5882,文化精神是指文化规范定义的某一特定文化或特定事件的习俗、传统，还有各种感情和情感的总合。,"Ethos refers to the customs, the traditions, also the feelings, the collective emotions, either of a given culture or of a given event which is defined according to cultural norms."
5882,更确切地说，是指它们带有区别性的特征或精神。,More specifically it refers to their distinctive character or spirit.
5882,这些概念是相关的，至少在他对国民性的研究中，由于跨文化的定义，文化精神似乎决定于某一文化的文化表象和另一文化表象的关系。,"These concepts are related, and at least in his national character study ethos seems to depend for its cross-cultural definition on the relation between the eidos of one culture and that of another."
5883,关于文化多元主义，我们能看到一些熟悉的例子:在瑞士，意大利的、德国的和法国的文化并存；在比利时，说法语的瓦隆人和说德语的佛兰德人拥有的文化遗产是有些不同的；在加拿大，说法语和说英语的加拿大人生活在一个多元的社会中（但在那里，对大多数原住民的平等承认仍成问题）。,"Some familiar examples of cultural pluralism may be seen in Switzerland, where Italian, German, and French cultures exist side by side; in Belgium, where the French Walloons and the Flemish have somewhat different cultural heritages; and in Canada, where French- and English-speaking Canadians live in a pluralistic society (but where most native people are not accorded equal recognition)."
5883,但是，在这些例子中间，没有哪种文化差异有在非西方的多元社会中所见到的那么大。,"In none of these cases, though, are the cultural differences (save those of native people in Canada) of the magnitude seen in many a non-Western pluralistic society."
5883,作为这种社会及其伴生问题的一个例子，我们来看一看中美洲危地马拉这个国家。,As an example of one such society—and its attendant problems—we will look at the Central American country of Guatemala.
5884,他随后又将这个十一项的范式略微简化。,He follows this eleven-fold paradigm with a slightly simpler one.
5884,这是一个建立在七项“基本需求”和各自对应的“文化反应”之间关系之上的范式 (Malinowski 1944：91-119 )。,This is the one built on the relationship between seven ‘basic needs’ and their respective ‘cultural responses’ (1944: 91– 119).
5884,接着，他继续提出一个四项的范式，在他看来，这四项的关联依然相当复杂，“工具性需要”与它们各自的“文化反应”。,"He then goes on to a four-fold one, relating what he sees as four, rather complex, ‘instrumental imperatives’ with their respective ‘cultural responses’."
5885,虽然人类学家会从发展或不发展的宏大理论中吸收洞见，他们主要关心的是，在不同的知识系统和文化活动之间的遭遇战中，如何展现地方的变化。,"Although anthropologists may draw insights from the grand theories of development or underdevelopment, their main concern has been to show local variations in the encounters between different systems of knowledge and cultural practices."
5885,详细的民族志对殖民和后殖民状况的描述说明了需要一种比全球化关系的一般模型所能提供的更加细微的理解。,Detailed ethnographies describing colonial and postcolonial situations have indicated a need for a more nuanced understanding than that provided by the general models of global relationships.
5885,奥利维亚·哈里斯（Olivia Harris 1995，pp.108–113）写到拉丁美洲的文化复杂性，特别是安第斯地区，她提出了一种描绘变化的类型学，由此，不同知识体系之间的社会性遭遇能够得以概念化。,"Olivia Harris (1995, pp. 108–13), writing on cultural complexity in Latin America and particularly the Andean area, has proposed a typology depicting variations in the ways in which social encounters between knowledge systems can be conceptualised."
5886,文化过程还是一个积累的过程，新的成分时时地汇入文化流程之中，增大了其总量。,The culture process is also cumulative; new elements enter the stream from time to time and swell the total.
5886,就文化有助于日益使人实现对自然力的控制和为人类生活提供更大的安全保障而言，它又是一个进步的过程。,"The culture process is progressive in the sense that it moves toward greater control over the forces of nature, toward greater security of life for man."
5886,因此，文化是--个符号的、持续的、积累的和进步的过程。,"Culture is, therefore, a symbolic, continuous, cumulative, and progressive process."
5887,朱利安·斯图尔德使用文化类型的概念说明地理区域内的变化。,Julian Steward used the concept of culture type to explain variations within geographic regions.
5887,他的观点是，根据特殊的技术以及那种技术最适合的特殊环境特点来考察一种文化。,In this view a culture is considered in terms of a particular technology and of the particular environmental features that technology is best suited for.
5887,一个社会的社会组织和政治组织是影响如何运用技术以保证持续生存的另外一些因素。在社会谋生方式中起作用的这些文化特点是其文化核心。,The social and political organization of a society are other factors that influence how technology can be used to ensure survival.The features of a culture that play a part in the way the society makes a living are its culture core.
5887,人类学家可以探索文化核心类型与环境类型之间的直接关系。,Anthropologists can trace direct relationships between types of culture cores and types of environments.
5888,实际上到了20世纪70年代， 马克思主义者同文化生态论 者在许多问题上的结论越来越趋相似。,"In fact by the 1970s, if not earlier, Marxists and cultural ecologists were coming to similar conclusions on a number of issues."
5888,"斯图尔德 (Steward 1955 )将马克思主义基础结构称为“文化核心"" (cultural core),他认为,文化核心是与环境开发有关的，并且是文化进化得以实现的基础。","Steward (1955) called the Marxist base the ‘cultural core’ (that related to exploitation of the environment and upon which, he argued, cultural evolution operated)."
5888,同样，马克思主义者上层建筑的概念类似于斯图尔德的“整体文化” (total culture) (文化传播得以实现的基础）概念。,"Likewise, the Marxist idea of superstructure resembled Steward’s idea of the ‘total culture’ (upon which cultural diffusion operated)."
5889,在他的文化进化的一般模型中，区别了社会文化一体化的不同水平，他的意思大致等同于本书在前面讨论过的小规模和大规模，也就是社会的不同大小和复杂程度。,"In his general model of cultural evolution, he distinguishes between different levels of sociocultural integration, by which he means roughly the same thing as in the discussion earlier in this book on small and large scale, namely the varying size and complexity of societies."
5889,不过，在斯图尔德的设想中，物质因素决定了一个社会的社会文化一体化的水平。,"In Steward's scheme, however, material factors determine a society's level of sociocultural integration."
5889,以他自己的著作中的肖肖尼印第安人（Shoshonean Indians）为例证，一体化的最低水平是家庭的整合程度，最高水平是国家的整合程度。,"The lowest level of integration, exemplified by the Shoshonean Indians in his own work, was that of the family.The highest level was that of the state."
5890,文化精神是指文化规范定义的某一特定文化或特定事件的习俗、传统，还有各种感情和情感的总合。,"Ethos refers to the customs, the traditions, also the feelings, the collective emotions, either of a given culture or of a given event which is defined according to cultural norms."
5890,更确切地说，是指它们带有区别性的特征或精神。,More specifically it refers to their distinctive character or spirit.
5890,这些概念是相关的，至少在他对国民性的研究中，由于跨文化的定义，文化精神似乎决定于某一文化的文化表象和另一文化表象的关系。,"These concepts are related, and at least in his national character study ethos seems to depend for its cross-cultural definition on the relation between the eidos of one culture and that of another."
5891,认识论相对论 (epistemological relativism)把描写性相对论中最可行的形式作为其出发点。,Epistemological relativism takes as its starting point the strongest possible form of descriptive relativism.
5891,它结合了认为文化多样性实际上是无限的这样一种极端文化决定论。,It combines an extreme cultural-determinist position with a view that cultural diversity is virtually limitless.
5891,"在这里我们有必要先区分一下""一般文化决定论"" (general  cultural determinism，认为存在一个普遍曲为人类所独有的文化模式，在这个模式下又有各文化的不同，如人类的“心理一致性"")和“特殊文化决定论"" (particular cultural  determinism,认为根本不存在这样一种人类文化模式）。","It is important here to distinguish between generic cultural determinism (which holds that there is a universal but uniquely human cultural pattern within which cultures vary, i.e., the ‘psychic unity’ of humankind) and particular cultural determinism (which holds that there is no such thing)."
5892,"瓦佩人对于祖先之灵的关注，是说明内化控制（或者文化控制）的一个很好的例子,这种控制是指这样一些信念：它们如此根深蒂固，以至于所有人都必须亲身对他或她的行为负责。","The Wape concern about ancestral ghosts is a good example of internalized, or cultural, controls beliefs so thoroughly ingrained that each person becomes personally responsible for his or her own conduct."
5892,文化控制（cultural control)可以被设想为心灵的内化控制，它与社会控制(social ccmtrol)相反，社会控制涉及外部强制。,"Cultural control may be thought of as control by the mind, as opposed to social control, which involves overt coercion."
5892,"在北美社会也 能找到文化控制的例子；例如，人们之所以避免犯乱伦之忌，与其说因为害怕法律惩罚,还不如说因为一想到这种事他们就有一种强烈的厌恶感，而且在做这种事时 他们会感到羞耻。","Examples of cultural control also can be found in North American society; for instance, people refrain from committing incest not so much from fear of legal punishment as from a sense of deep disgust at the thought of the act and from the shame they would feel in performing it."
5893,朱利安·斯图尔德使用文化类型的概念说明地理区域内的变化。,Julian Steward used the concept of culture type to explain variations within geographic regions.
5893,他的观点是，根据特殊的技术以及那种技术最适合的特殊环境特点来考察一种文化。,In this view a culture is considered in terms of a particular technology and of the particular environmental features that technology is best suited for.
5893,一个社会的社会组织和政治组织是影响如何运用技术以保证持续生存的另外一些因素。在社会谋生方式中起作用的这些文化特点是其文化核心。,The social and political organization of a society are other factors that influence how technology can be used to ensure survival.The features of a culture that play a part in the way the society makes a living are its culture core.
5893,人类学家可以探索文化核心类型与环境类型之间的直接关系。,Anthropologists can trace direct relationships between types of culture cores and types of environments.
5894,这种渐进论的陈述赋予了人类学进化论从单线进化到普遍进化，再到多线进化研究的特征。,"This gradualist statement characterizes much in evolutionist anthropology from the unilinear, to the universal, to the multilinear approaches."
5894,然而，它同达尔文和马克思的观点（参见第六章）依然存在一些矛盾。,Yet it is contradictory to the ideas of both Darwin and Marx (see chapter 6).
5894,今天，无论今天有关文化起源的具体理论是否能够存在下去，渐进论同变革论之间的争论今天似乎仍将继续。,"The debate today between gradualists and revolutionists seems set to continue, whether today’s specific theories of culturo-genesis survive or not."
5895,文化区域是不同的社会遵循相同生活模式的地区，因为不同的地理区域在气候和地貌上往往是不一致的，新的发现并不总是传播到每一个群体。,"A culture area is a geographic region where various societies follow similar life patterns.Since geographic regions are not always uniform in climate and topography, new discoveries do not always spread to every group."
5895,环境的变化也有利于技术的变化，因为不同地区的需要可能是完全不同的。,"Environmental variation also favors variation in technology, since needs may be quite different from area to area."
5895,朱利安·斯图尔德使用文化类型的概念说明地理区域内的变化。,Julian Steward used the concept of culture type to explain variations within geographic regions.
5895,他的观点是，根据特殊的技术以及那种技术最适合的特殊环境特点来考察一种文化。,In this view a culture is considered in terms of a particular technology and of the particular environmental features that technology is best suited for.
5896,每一位人类学家都会专门研究一些文化区域——他／她在那里做田野工作。,Each and every anthropologist specializes in the study of some culture area – that where he or she does fieldwork.
5896,但是，文化区域的重要性由于田野民族志作者的理论兴趣不同而呈多样性。,Yet the importance of the culture area varies according to the theoretical interest of the ethnographer.
5896,从广义上说，区分两种文化区域研究是大有裨益的。,"Broadly, it is useful to distinguish two kinds of culture-area approach."
5896,"第一种文化区域研究是发展自德奥传播论的美国人类学观点，另一种是更多的传播研究，它绝不是一种单一思想流派或者国家传统，而是“区域比较"" (regional comparison）。","The first is that of American anthropology as it developed from German-Austrian diffusionism.The other, a much more diffuse approach, and in no sense a single school of thought or national tradition, is that of ‘regional comparison’."
5897,我们看到，在埃赫那顿去世后，这些文化趋势在埃及仍持续了若干世纪。,We observe these cultural trends continuing in Egypt for centuries after Ikhnaton's death.
5897,王室将整合机构中的宗教方面排除出去的企图归于失败，因为它必然会失败。到目前为止，社会整合与社会调节的宗教方面尚未在任何一个国家中排除出去，因为苏联重建教会特别清晰地表明了这一点。,"The attempt of the throne to eliminate the ecclesiastical component of the integrative mechanism failed, as fail it must; the ecclesiastic aspect of social integration and regulation has not yet been eliminated from any nation so far, as the re-establishment of the church in the Soviet Union makes emphatically clear."
5898,拉策尔和弗罗贝纽斯之后，弗里兹•格雷布内尔和威廉•施密特继续领导文化圈研究。,"After Ratzel and Frobenius, Fritz Graebner and Wilhelm Schmidt took the lead in Kulturkreis studies."
5898,格雷布内尔是一位博物馆学家，集中研究首先跨越大洋洲然后遍布全球的物质文化的相似件。,"Graebner, a museologist, concentrated on similarities in material culture, first across Oceania and later throughout the world."
5898,拉策尔一直强调文化质量，而格雷布内尔则喜欢量化尺度。,"Ratzel had emphasized the qualities of cultures, and Frobenius had favoured a quantitative dimension."
5899,同时，在德语区中出现了一种瑞士社会人类学，有段时间人们把类学它当成法兰克福和维也纳学派的“理论郊区”一样对待（这样来解释欧内斯特˙盖尔纳）。,"Simultaneously, an emerging Swiss social anthropology in German was treated for a while as if it were a theoretical suburb of Frankfurt and Vienna (to paraphrase Ernest Gellner)."
5899,例如在弗赖堡，施密特的圣言会（Societas Verbi Divini)的思想体制保持着重要的学术前沿位置（这种情况在1980年代才改变）。,"In Freiburg/Fribourg, for instance, Schmidt's Societas Verbi Divini (SVD) order maintained an important academic outpost (this was to change only in the 1980s)."
5899,圣言会领导的期刊《人类学家》作为这一领域三到四份主要德语期刊之一而重新出现。,The SVD-led journal Anthropos also reemerged as one of the field's three or four leading journals in German.
5899,在巴塞尔，著名的纺织品研究专家艾尔弗雷德˙布勒（Alfred Buhler)和他的团队在文化形态学和文化圈理论中沉迷了好一阵子。,In Basel it took eminent textile specialist Alfred Bühler and his team a while to disentangle from cultural morphology and culture circle theory.
5900,体质人类学家研究作为生物有机体的人，追溯人类动物的演化发展，考察过去和现在人类内部的生物学变异。,"Physical anthropologists study humans as biological organisms, tracing the evolutionary development of the human animal and looking at biological variations within the species, past and present."
5900,文化人类学对人类文化惑兴趣，或者对社会的生活方式感兴趣。,"Cultural anthropologists are concerned with human cultures, or the ways of life in societies."
5900,在文化人类学领域有考古学家、语言学家和民族学家。考古学家通常从过去的文化出发研究物质对象，试图以此解释人类行为：语言学家研究语言，文化借助语言得以维持并代代相传；民族学家研究已观察到、体验到的文化，与他们想要了解其文化的那些人进行讨论。,"Within the field of cultural anthropology are archaeologists, who seek to explain human behavior by studying material objects, usually from past cultures; linguists, who study languages, by which cultures are maintained and passed on to succeeding generations; and ethnologists, who study cultures as they have been observed, experienced, and discussed with persons whose culture they seek to understand."
5901,这些轨迹在本质上被生态环境所限制，也就是说，被技术的历史决定性，以及自然环境的非常重要的更深层的限定因素所限制。,"These trajectories were essentially limited by ecological circumstances, that is, by historical determinations of technology and the very important further limiting factor of the natural environment."
5901,从而，多线进化论与文化生态学的理念紧密地联系在一起。通过类比生物物种形成理论，多线进化论也与生物学中的达尔文思想的观点存在某些相似之处。,"Thus multilinear evolutionism became closely bound with the idea of cultural ecology.It also shares a certain similarity with Darwinian thought in biology, by its analogy with the biological theory of speciation."
5902,然后，他们着手研究大部分来自美国原住民、非洲裔美国人、两班牙裔美国人家庭的儿童，通过他们的理论框架解释邦研究成果来进一步“确认”这一观点。,"They then proceeded to ""confirm"" this idea by studying children, mostly from Native American, African American, and Hispanic populations, interpreting the results through the protective screen of their theory."
5902,相比较而言，对“义化上受剥夺”儿童的文化所做的民族志研究揭示不同的情况。,"By contrast, ethnographic research on the cultures of ""culturally deprived"" children reveals a different story."
5902,他们非但没有受到文化剥夺，而是具有复杂精美、熟练的、有适应力的文化，这些文化只不过不同于教育体系采纳的文化罢了。,"Far from being culturally deprived, they have elaborate, sophisticated, and adaptive cultures that are simply different from the ones espoused by the educational system."
5902,虽然一些人仍然坚持文化剥夺理论，但这种理论是受文化束缚的， 它只不过说，人们“被剥夺我的文化”。,"Although some still cling to it, the cultural-deprivation theory is culture bound and is merely a way of saying people are ""deprived"" of my culture."
5902,你无法证明，这些儿童不说恰如其分的西班牙语、美国黑人的本地英语(有时被称为Ebonics或“黑人英语”），或任何其他语言；显然，对于他们的文化视为重要的事情，他们做得很好。,"One cannot argue that such children do not speak adequate Spanish, Ebonics (sometimes called ""Black English""), or whatever; clearly they do well with what is considered important in their cultures."
5903,最著名的“文化复合体”或者”特质复合体”的个案是由著名的研究非洲的非洲裔美国人类学家梅尔维尔•赫斯科维茨提出的(Herskovits 1926 )。,"The best-known example of a ‘culture complex’ or ‘trait complex’ was one proposed by the famous American anthropologist of Africa and African-America, Melville Herskovits (1926)."
5903,他称之为“东非养牛复合体 (cattle complex of East Africa)”。,He called it the ‘cattle complex of East Africa’.
5903,在那里发现了养牛，还有游牧、父系继嗣、年龄组、彩礼、牲畜与祖先的联系，还有许多互相联系的文化特质。,"Where cattle are found, so too are nomadism, patrilineal descent, age sets, bridewealth, the association of livestock with the ancestors, and a host of other interrelated culture traits."
5903,赫斯科维茨和德国学者都说文化特质的分布状态在彼此关联中存在，就是说，并不是任意分布的。,"Both Herskovits and the German writers spoke of distributions of traits existing in relation to each other, that is, not distributed randomly."
5904,"文化相对主义怍为研究工具不管有多么重要，人们都不必永远中止判断,我们也不必捍卫任何民族参与任何文化实践的权利，不管具有怎样的破坏性。","Essential though cultural relativism is as a re-search tool, it does not require suspension of judgment forever or that we must defend the right of any people to engage in any practice, no matter how reprehensible."
5904,最为必要的 是，在对我们感兴趣的文化有充分理解之前，我们要避免不成熟的判断。,All that is necessary is that we avoid premature judgment until we have a proper understanding of the culture we are interested in.
5904,那时，而且只有在那时，人类学家才可能采取批判的立场。,"Then, and only then, may one adopt a critical stance."
5904,就如戴维·梅伯里-莱维斯所强调的:“你免不了作判断，只不过推迟作判断而已，旨在以后作明智的判断。”,"As David Maybury-Lewis emphasizes: One does not avoid making judgements, but rather postpones them in order to make informed judgements later."
5905,自然科学本身也确实不止一次地遇到障碍。,"On more than one point, the natural sciences themselves found an obstacle in faith."
5905,但是，当人成为科学的对象时，这种抵制就变得犹为激烈。,But it is especially when man became an object of science that the resistance became fierce.
5905,有宗教信仰的人难免对把人当作自然物并象对其它事物一样加以研究，以及将道德事实当成自然事实而感到厌恶。,"The believer, indeed, cannot but find repugnant the idea that man is to be studied as a natural being, analogous to others, and moral facts as facts of nature."
5905,众所周知，这类公众情绪在其所采取的不同形式之下，是如何阻碍心理学和社会学[文化学]的发展的。,"It is well known how these collective sentiments, under the different forms they have taken, have hindered the development of psychology and sociology [culturology]."
5906,它是否被接受还与创新者的声望及接受群体有关。,Its acceptance is also connected with the prestige of the innovator and recipient groups.
5906,传播是一个社会向另一个社会借用一种文化元素。,Diffusion is the borrowing by one society of a cultural element from another.
5906,文化遗失是指在有或者没有替代品的情况下，对一些特性或习俗的废弃。,Cultural loss involves the abandonment of some trait or practice with or without replacement.
5906,人类学家给予涵化以相当多的关注。,Anthropologists have given considerable attention to acculturation.
5906,涵化源于不同文化的群体之间密切而直接的接触，并在一方或双方群体的文化模式上造成重大变化。,It stems from intensive firsthand contact of groups with different cultures and produces major changes in the cultural patterns of one or both groups.
5906,实际或威胁使用武力总是涵化中的一个因素。,The actual or threatened use of force is always a factor in acculturation.
5907,“萨丕尔－沃尔夫假说”顾名思义是由沃尔夫和他的导师提出的。,"The ‘Sapir–Whorf hypothesis’, as this idea became known, bears the name of both Whorf and his mentor."
5907,（爱德华• 萨丕尔是博厄斯的学生，也是“文化与人格”研究和人类语言学的创始人。,(Edward Sapir was himself a student of Boas and a practitioner of both ‘culture and personality’ studies and anthropological linguistics.)
5907,）这一假说在理论上认为，思维方式不只仅有“我们的”和“他们的”这两种，而是多种多样的。而且每种思维方式与思想者的语言是相联系的。,"In principle, the hypothesis suggests that there are not just two forms of thought, ‘ours’ and ‘theirs’, but a multiplicity of forms of thought, each associated with the language of its thinkers."
5908,普遍进化论作为单线进化论的教条的一种软化，出现于 20 世纪初。,Universal evolutionism emerged in the early twentieth century as a softening of the tenets of unilinear evolutionism.
5908,根据新的田野民族志和考古证据，确切的跨文化一致且遍布世界的单线进化阶段不能再维持下去了。,"In light of new ethnographic and archaeological evidence, precise unilinear phases, consistent cross-culturally and throughout the world, could no longer be sustained."
5908,所以取而代之，假定存在更广泛的、“普遍的”进化阶段，比如“蒙昧”、 “野蛮”、  “文明”（其中摩尔根所支持的）之间的经典划分等。,"So instead, broad, ‘universal’ phases of evolution were postulated, such as the classical division between ‘savagery’, ‘barbarism’, and ‘civilization’ (championed by Morgan, among others)."
5909,新闻写作和文学很难描述，因为它们较少有明确的学术规范，主要是察觉和讲述被视作值得看和听的不论什么东西。,"The writing of journalism and literature is difficult to characterize, for these are less academic disciplines than ways of perceiving and telling about whatever is deemed worth seeing and hearing."
5909,不过，我们还是可以从中看出一些倾向。,"Still, certain tendencies can be noted."
5909,标准的头版头条新闻的目标是“得到新闻”。,"Standard front-page journalism is aimed at ""getting the news""."
5909,就像沃夫（Evelyn Waugh)的Scoop一书中幽默地描绘的，那一努力可能会将新闻工作者置于一个异乎寻常的地方，但他通常不会发现有必要甚或有可能深入当地社区成为其中的一部分，通常，进入社区，得到故事，随后他就会离开那里。,"As humorously depicted in Evelyn Waugh’s Scoop, that endeavor may locate the journalist in exotic places, but he does not usually find it necessary or even possible to become deeply part of the local community; normally, he moves in, gets his story, and moves out."
5910,格尔兹说，他的人类学是一种寻求意义的阐释的（interpretive)人类学，但它不是一门寻找解释（explanation)的科学。,"His anthropology, he said, was an interpretive one in search of meaning; it was not a science in search of explanation."
5910,随着他对实证主义社会科学越来越排斥，格尔兹转向了解释学，并且尤其转向了文学批评。,"Increasingly hostile to positivist social science, Geertz turned to hermeneutics and specifically to literary criticism."
5910,文化对他来说是一种民族志作者越过当地人的肩膀阅读出来的文本，他为他的方法了贴上了“深描”（thick description)的标签，通过这种方法，他能够“对解释进行解释”（explicate explications)。他用民族志例子，如巴厘岛的斗鸡来对这一点进行了说明。,"Culture for him was a text that the ethnographer read over the shoulders of the native.He labeled his method ""thick description,"" through which he would ""explicate explications,"" and he illustrated it with ethnographic examples such as the Balinese cockfight."
5911,为了理解人类的生活，想办法全盘了解他们的经验世界就非常必要；而为了在这方面获得成功，只注意一些选定的“变量”是不够的。,"In order to understand people's lives, it is therefore necessary to try to grasp the totality of their experiential world; and in order to succeed in this project, it is inadequate to look at selected ""variables""."
5911,显然，对于一个不常见到金钱和工资的社会来说，诸如“年收人”这样的概念是毫无意义的。,"Obviously, a concept such as ""annual income"" is meaningless in a society where neither money nor wagework is common."
5911,这种论述可以被看做是对我族中心主义的驳斥。,This kind of argument may be read as a warning against ethnocentrism.
5911,这个术语（ethnocentrism 来自希腊语“ethnos”，意思是“一个人”）意味着从某人的价值观念去评价别人以及用某人自己的话语去描述他们。某人自己的“ethnos”（包括他的文化价值观）完全被放置到判断依据的中心。在这样的思维框架里，其他人必然变成是对某人拙劣的仿制品。,"This term (from Greek ""ethnos"", meaning ""a people"") means evaluating other people from one's own vantage-point and describing them in one's own terms."
5911,如果苏丹的努尔人不能通过抵押买到房子，他们的社会就显得不如我们的社会完美。,
5911,问题：错译改1：为了理解人类的生活，想办法全盘了解他们的经验世界就非常必要；而为了在这方面获得成功，只注意一些选定的“变量”是不够的。,
5911,显然，对于一个不常见到金钱和工资的社会来说，诸如“年收人”这样的概念是毫无意义的。这种论述可以被看做是对我族中心主义的驳斥。这个术语（ethnocentrism 来自希腊语“ethnos”，意思是“一个民族”）意味着从某人的价值观念去评价别人以及用某人自己的话语去描述他们。某人自己的“ethnos”（包括他的文化价值观）完全被放置到判断依据的中心。,"One's own ""ethnos"", including one's cultural values, is literally placed at the centre."
5911,在这样的思维框架里，其他人必然变成是对某人拙劣的仿制品。,"Within this frame of thought, other peoples would necessarily appear as inferior imitations of oneself."
5911,如果苏丹的努尔人不能通过抵押买到房子，他们的社会就显得不如我们的社会完美。,"If the Nuer of the Sudan are unable to get a mortgage to buy a house, they thus appear to have a less perfect society than ourselves."
5912,他们的观点源于一种缺失感：现代社会缺乏传统意义上的家，这种家具有固定性和物理上的中心，具有绝对的价值观念和统一的实体。,"Their ideas derive from a sense of loss: that in the modern world there has been lost a traditional home of fixity and physical centredness, of absolute values and a unified reality."
5912,如今这种“原初”社会文化环境被连根拔起，后来的也不能成为真正意义上的家。,"Now uprooted from this first and ‘original’ socio-cultural milieu, no succeeding one becomes truly home."
5912,个体穿行于多重的生活世界，却未能找到一个家。,Individuals are in transit between a plurality of life-worlds but come to be at home in none.
5912,博格等人把这种情形描述成常态、精神上和认知上的：混乱的社会迁移与世界观上形而上学的无家之感有关，后者又与个人在自我意识层次上的疏离有关。,"Berger et al. describe this condition as at once normative, spiritual and cognitive: the anomy of social movement correlates with a metaphysical sense of homelessness in the cosmos which correlates with personal alienation on the level of consciousness."
5913,在关于无家可归者的作品中，霍米˙巴哈巴哈提供了一些好建议。,"In his writings on the unhomely, Homi Bhabha is offering some good advice."
5913,通过证明无家可归者在原本就很少属于他们自己的领地上是没有权力的，他的目标是找到一条让他们自己获得权力的途径。,"By demonstrating to the powerless the unhomely territory which is singularly their own, his aim is to suggest a way through which they could begin the process of self-empowerment."
5913,他倡导“识别文学”的发展，希望人们能够以此来表述、否定和传承他们自己的历史愿望。,"He calls for the development of a ""literature of recognition"", through which these peoples could find the means to signify, negate and initiate their own historic desire."
5913,通过发现他们自己的声音，他们的作品将能够最终动摇传统的文化支配关系。,"By discovering their own voices, their writings could have revisionary force toward the end of destabilizing traditional relations of cultural domination."
5914,人类长期以来抱有万能的幻觉。,Man has long cherished the illusion of omnipotence.
5914,这种幻觉使人的自我感到满足和舒适。,It is flattering and comforting to his ego.
5914,在过去，人相信能够控制天气，无数的原始民族为祈求雨水、平息大风和预防暴风雪而举行各种仪式。,"In days gone by, man has believed that he could control the weather; countless primitive peoples have had rituals for making rain, stilling high winds, or averting storms."
5914,很多民族举行仪式，希望依赖它们而“控制”太阳在天空中的行程。,"Many have had ceremonies by means of which the course of the sun in the heavens could be ""controlled."""
5914,随着科学的进展，人以自己为万能的信念已逐渐减弱了，但仍然认定人能控制自己的文明。,"With the advance of science, however, man's faith in his omnipotence has diminished.But he still believes that he can control his civilization."
5915,推测无言贸易的各种原因，在某些情况下，它也许因缺乏共同语言而无言。,"The reasons for silent trade only can be postulated, but in some situations trade may be silent for lack of a common language."
5915,无言贸易较常起的作用是控制不信任的情境，使得关系保持和睦。,More often it may serve to control situations of distrust so as to keep relations peaceful.
5915,在真正现实的意义上，良好的关系是通过抑制关系维持的。,"In a very real sense, good relations are maintained by preventing relations."
5915,"不排除其他因素的另一种可能性是，在身份难题也许使得口头交流不能加以考虑的地方,无言贸易却使交换成为可能。","An other possibility, which does not exclude the others, is that it makes exchange possible where problems of status might make verbal communication unthinkable."
5915,尽管有潜在的障碍，但不管怎样，无言贸易为两个群体之间的物品交换提供了途径。,"In any event, it provides for the exchange of goods between groups in spite of potential barriers."
5916,常规的时间一空间亦是美的和道德的；为公正牺牲和共同集体物品的再分配提供了一个范例。,"Then again, the routinization of space—time was also aesthetic and moral; it provided a model for redistributive justice, sacrifice, and the common, collective good."
5916,家是微观意义上的社区，通过开放和经常性的交流、劳动分工、权利和义务、共进晚餐以及资源的轮换等手段来协调其成员。这超越了极权模式。,"Homes were communities in microcosm which coordinated their members by way of open and constant communication, a division of labour, rights and duties, a commensal meal, and a rotation of access to resources."
5916,后者采取强制性的手段控制成员的思想、身体和言论以维护稳定。,"They encompassed total-prestatory systems which exerted possibly tyrannous control over their members' minds, bodies and tongues in their search for solidarity."
5917,这一点可以从“是”或“不是”的姿势表达中看出来。,"This point can be further demonstrated by gestural expressions for ""yes"" and ""no""."
5917,在北美，一个人点头表示“是”或者摇头表示“不是”。斯里兰卡人也对确有其事的问题点头回答“是”，但如果被请求去做某事，则低斜一下头表示“行”。,"In North America, one nods the head for ""yes"", or shakes it for ano.n The people of Sri Lanka, also, will nod to answer ""yes"", to a factual question, but if they are asked to do something, a slow sideways movement of the head means ""yes""."
5917,"在希腊，点头意味着“是”，而猛一回头把脸提起来则表示“否”；同时,眼睛往往闭着，眉毛提起来。","In Greece, the nodded head means ""yes"", but ""no"" is indicated by jerking the head back so as to lift the face, while the eyes are often closed and the eyebrows lifted."
5917,诸如此类的身体运动和姿势，通常被称为习惯性姿势，它们在不同文化之间是有差异的，是不得不加以学习的。,"Body movements and gestures such as these, which vary cross-culturally and have to be learned, are known as conventional gestures."
5918,更准确地说（Steiner 1975：46）），“社区语言”，无论其社会轮廓是否一致，都是言语元素和不可化约的个体意志的源源不断的多样化聚合”。,"More precisely (Steiner again (1975:46)): ‘the language of a community, however uniform its social contour, is an inexhaustibly multiple aggregate of speech-atoms, of finally irreducible personal meanings’."
5918,因此，在使用一个代码时，我们发现说者和听者既利用一个多少有着共同性的公认语言，同时也利用多少有些差异的个人辞典和个人习语，在两者之间以不可预知的方式创立随机性关联。,"In using a code, therefore, we find speaker—hearers drawing upon a more or less common vulgate and also upon a more or less private thesaurus, an idiolect, making contingent connections in unpredictable ways."
5918,个体经验和企图与社会背景与习俗通过种种不可化约的特殊方式混合在一起。,Individual experiences and intentions and social contexts and conventions mix in irreducibly specific ways.
5919,所有分层社会至少都提供一些流动（mobility），这有助于减轻任何不平等系统内部所固有的紧张。,"All stratified societies offer at least some mobility, and this helps to ease the strains in any system of inequality."
5919,甚至连印度的种姓制度——其主导意识形态自称该制度内部所有的安排都是静止不动的——也有着令人吃惊的弹性和流动，而并非所有这一切都与最近的“现代化”带给印度的变化有关。,"Even the Indian caste system, with its guiding ideology that pretends all arrangements within it are static, has a surprising amount of flexibility and mobility, not all of it associated with the recent changes ""modernization"" has brought to India."
5919,一个恰当而生动的例子是，在拉贾斯坦邦中，那些拥有和控制最多的土地、富裕且政治上掌权的人并非如人所料是武士等级/而是最低等级。,"As a rather dramatic case in point, in the state of Rajasthan, those who own and control most land and who are wealthy and politically powerful are not of warrior caste, as one would expect, but are of the lowest caste."
5920,这些批评者像许多其他的人类学家一样，将现代化理论当作其强烈谴责的对象。,These critics were among the many anthropologists for whom modernization theory was anathema.
5920,他们对此的看法是：现代化理论实际上歪曲了现实并且它作为一种关于进步和现代性的意识形态，取代了对多种变化进程的寻找。,They saw it as distorting realities on the ground and as substituting an ideology of progress and modernity for a search for diverse processes of change.
5920,他们同样关注它的政策意义，尤其是它看待第三世界欠发达地区的方式以及相应开展的一系列发展计划。,"They were also concerned about its policy implications, especially in the way it viewed underdevelopment and development programs in the Third World."
5920,因此，当时许多关于复杂社会的人类学研究提出了对现代化方法的批评并且提供了替代分析。,A good deal of anthropological work on complex societies at the time thus offered critiques of modernization approaches and proposed alternative analyses.
5921,有一些清晰的事例，可以说明现代主义是正确的。,There are some very clear cases where modernism holds true.
5921,爱沙尼亚人就是一个例子。,Take the Estonians.
5921,在19世纪初，他们甚至没有自己的名字。,At the beginning of the nineteenth century they did not even have a name for themselves.
5921,与邻居德意志、瑞典公民和贵族以及俄国统治者不同，他们被简单地归为生活在陆地上的人。,"They were simply referred to as people who lived on the land, as opposed to German or Swedish burghers and aristocrats and Russian administrators."
5922,区别不在于现象的复杂性而在于懂得你的课题是什么，以及如何去解决它。,The difference lies not in complexity of phenomena but in knowing what youi problem is and how to attack it.
5922,物理学家知道什么是他的课题和如何着手解决课题。社会科学家却做不到这点。,The physicist knows what his problem is and how to go about solving it; the social scientist does not.
5922,而这种状况的原因在于，若干世纪以来，在物理学领域中理论观点和科学技术已趋于成熟和完善；反之，科学之被引入社会领域不过是不久前的事情。,"And the reason for this is that the point of view and the techniques of science have been growing and maturing in the physical domain for centuries, whereas they were introduced into the social realm only yesterday."
5923,这种情况发生在一个城市主导的国家里，这个国家的大规模城市化在两个多世纪前就开始了，150年来农村人口都少于城市，大约90%的人口居住在城市、小镇或郊区。,"This is the case in an overwhelmingly urban country, where mass urbanization began more than two centuries ago, where the rural population has been outnumbered for some 150 years, and where some 90% of the population now resides in city, town or suburb."
5923,英国人对乡村的强烈喜好从未食减，就像有人说的，“乡村”是情致所在，值得保护和拜访（Palmer等 1977: 739)。,"What may be described as a British love-affair with the rural continues unabated: the ""countryside""as a place of sentiment, to preserve and to visit (Palmer et al. 1977:739)."
5923,“乡村牧歌”是流传最广最持久的神话：在这个浪漫的想法和理想中，如今被托管给农村人口的乡村是人们最合适的、健康的、原始的，可能也是最后的栖居之地。,"""The rural idyll"" remains one of the most widespread and abiding myths in common circulation: a romantic idea and ideal of the rural as the proper, the healthy, the original, maybe too the eventual, place of people’s habitation, and which the current rural population holds in trust."
5924,然而，盖尔纳说他原则上不反对人类学的相对主义。,"However, Gellner says he is not in principle against anthropological relativism."
5924,“关于达致宽容的情境化解释，我的主要观点是”，他写道，“需要谨慎为之”（第32页）。,"""My main point about tolerance-engendering contextual interpretation,"" he writes, ""is that it calls for caution"" (32)."
5924,但是为什么要对“达致宽容的”(与达致不宽容相对立）的情境化解释保持谨慎，他没有解释。,"But why such caution is reserved for ""tolerance-engendering"" as opposed to intolerance-engendering contextual interpretations is not explained."
5924,毕竟，盖尔纳早就坚持认为，所有被翻译的句子注定要受到要么“好”要么“坏”的评价。,"After all, Gellner insisted earlier that all translated sentences are bound to be received either as ""Good"" or as ""Bad."""
5924,为什么我们只是怀疑那些显得“好”的句子？,"Why should we be suspicious only of those that appear ""Good""?"
5924,如果是因为“最初就决定将本土论断S从有利的方面加以解释，而这将决定将多少情境纳人考虑之中”(第33页），那么，我们也许能通过采用非同情的态度来逃脱这个恶性循环？,"If ""it is the prior determination that S, the indigenous affirmation, be interpreted favourably, which determines just how much context will be taken into consideration"" (33), can we perhaps escape this vicious circularity by adopting an unsympathetic attitude?"
5925,这些标志在那时的波多黎各是与财产的微分途径紧密相连的。,"Such markers were, in Puerto Rico at this time, closely linked with differential access to property."
5925,但是，这些无须成为例证。,"However, this need not be the case."
5925,如同经济学家索尔斯坦·维布伦（Thorstein Veblen）所显示的（Veblen 1953 [1899]）那样，作为一种印象管理的形式，美国人会为了获得身份符号而努力，以便造成他们比实际的状况更为富有的印象。,"As the economist Thorstein Veblen has shown (1953 [1899]), Americans may strive to acquire status symbols, as a form of impression management, to give the impression that they are better off than they actually are."
5925,维布伦将这种策略叫做炫耀性消费。,Veblen calls this kind of strategy conspicuous consumption.
5925,不久以前，皮埃尔·布迪厄建立了一种“文化阶级”的系统理论，将法国作为他的主要经验实例（Bourdieu 1979；也可参见Jenkins 1993）。,"More recently, Pierre Bourdieu has developed a systematic theory of ""cultural classes"", taking France as his chief empirical example (Bourdieu 1979; see also Jenkins 1993)."
5926,在群体内发生的交换一般采取泛化互惠或平衡互惠的形当交换在两个群体之间进行时，就可能有敌对和竞争的倾向。,"Exchanges that occur within a group of people generally take the form of generalized or balanced reciprocity.When they occur between two groups, at least a potential for hostility and competition is apt to exist."
5926,因此，这类交换可能采取消极互惠的形式，除非人们做好某种安排，确保交换大致接近于平衡。,"Therefore, such exchanges may well take the form of negative reciprocity, unless some sort of arrangement has been made to ensure at least an approach to balance."
5926,物物交换是消极互惠的一种形式，通过这种交换，一个群体的稀缺物品与另一个群体的合意物品相交换。,"Barter is one form of negative reciprocity, involving the exchange of scarce items from one group for desirable goods from another group."
5926,交换时要计算相对价值，尽管双方外表上满不在乎，与一个群体内部交换更加平衡的性质相比，精明的交易更是惯例。,"Relative value is calculated, and despite an outward show of indifference, sharp trading is more the rule, when compared to the more balanced nature of exchanges within a group."
5927,对话模式原则上不是自传性的；它们并不必然导致过度的自我意识或自我专注。,"Dialogical modes are not, in principle, autobiographical; they need not lead to hyper self-consciousness or self-absorption."
5927,如巴赫金（Bakhtin 1981)指出的，在任何复杂地再现的话语空间（民族志的话语空间，或者在巴赫金的例子里，现实主义小说的话语空间），对话过程都层出不穷，众声喧哗。,"As Bakhtin (1981) has shown, dialogical processes proliferate in any complexly represented discursive space (that of an ethnography, or, in his case, a realist novel).Many voices clamor for expression."
5927,在传统民族志中，通过给一个声音以压倒性的权威功能，而把其他人当作可以引用或转写其言语的信息来源，“被访人”，复调性受到限制和整编。,"Polyvocality was restrained and orchestrated in traditional ethnographies by giving to one voice a pervasive authorial function and to others the role of sources, ""informants,"" to be quoted or paraphrased."
5927,一旦承认对话论和复调是文本生产的模式，单声部的权威就受到质疑，这种权威也被揭示为一门主张再现文化的科学的特性。,"Once dialogismi and polyphony are recognized as modes of textual production, monophonie authority is questioned, revealed to be characteristic of a science that has claimed to represent cultures."
5928,"龙头山区域的土墩墓藏中出土的器物也较为丰富,主要有坛、罐、双耳罐、瓿、豆、鬲、觑、盉、鼎、盂、铜环、钵、纺轮、斧、铲、锛、璜、削、器盖等,虽然出土器物较少,但是除了器型较为复杂外,还有不少独特的器物的出土,器物摆放也较有规律性,文化内涵极为丰富。","The grave-goods that were unearthed as artifacts from the Longtou Mountain mound tombs could be classified into diversified categories, including main altar, jars, pots with double ears, Bu, Dou, Li, Yan, He, Ding, Yu, copper rings, bowls, spinning wheel, ax, shovel, adze, semicircular jade ornament, razor, lid, etc.Although they did not appear in large quantities, many of the artifacts unearthed were quite unique.They were also placed according a certain pattern and carried abundant cultural connotations."
5928,"从器物的出土状况和器形、质地等各方面可以看出,龙头山土墩墓具有一定的独特性,通过与周边地区及本地区的土墩墓的比较,可以看出,龙头山土墩墓群与千峰山土墩墓群虽然存在有一定的差异,但是整体文化内涵和文化类型应该是一致的。","The state, shape, texture and other aspects of these unearthed artifacts showed the uniqueness of these mound tombs.If we compare them with those unearthed in nearby regions, we shall notice that although Longtou mountain mound tombs and Qianfeng mountain mound tombs are different in many aspects, the overall cultural connotations and types are consistent."
5928,与周边其他地区的土墩墓相比存在有较为明显的差异。,"This is not the case with other tombs in the surrounding area, where a major distinction is made."
5928,"据此,可以初步认为,龙头山土墩墓群应该与千峰山土墩墓群共同形成了这个地区独特的区域文化。","Accordingly, we can hold the preliminary view that the Longtou mountain mound tombs should share the same unique regional culture with the Qianfeng mountain tombs."
5928,"龙头山土墩墓群存在有一个连续性和过渡性,很有可能是一个长期的持久的使用的墓地,应该是一个较为重要的小区域的活动中心,它的独特性,说明了安徽南陵在这一时期,应该是一个具有突出特征的独特的文化区域,是一个重要的文化源地。","The continuity and transition of the Longtou mountain mound tombs can be seen as the evidence of a long-term and sustainable use of the cemetery.It should have been a important activity center of this small area.During this period,Nanling county of Anhui province should be a prominent cultural region with unique cultural characteristics.It might also be an important cultural birthplace."
5929,这种二分法认为，女人局限于私人和内在的领域，所以在男性的公共与政治领域中会受到贬低。,"The distinction assumes that women are imprisoned within the domain of the private and the domestic, and therefore devalued by the male public and political arena."
5929,女性主义思想对政治理论、心理学和道德哲学的一个最主要的贡献就是质疑了在公共与私人之间的划分 (Gilligan 1982; Benhabib 1992；Baier l994)。,"One of the chief contributions of feminist thought to political theory, psychology and moral philosophy is to question this line that divides the public and the private (cf. Gilligan 1982; Benhabib 1992; Baier 1994)."
5929,女人被束缚在私人领域，限制在正义的判断之外，在当代关于正义和社区的理论中处于一种无形地位。,"Women, being bound to the domain of the private, have been confined beyond the pale of justice where they take an invisible place within contemporary theories of justice and community."
5930,我已经描述过了各种争论所带来的剧痛，其中包括后现代主义的支持者与批评者之间的争论和在此之前的政治经济学与解释主义之间的争论，以及更早的唯物主义与心智主义之间的争论。,"I have described the throes of the debate between advocates and critics of postmodernism, and before that the debate over political economy versus interpretivism, and before that the debate over materialism versus mentalism."
5930,当每次转向一种新的对立时，早期的对立就被宣布为过时了。每一个阶段也存在着超越这些分歧的努力。,"With each turn to a new opposition, the earlier ones were declared to be outdated, and in each phase too there were efforts to transcend the differences."
5930,在1990年代，我们仍然面对着学科内的又一个认识论分歧，它形成了第二条断层线：即存在于实证主义者和建构主义者之间的分歧。,"In the 1990s we were faced with yet another epistemological division within the discipline, which formed a second fault line: that between positivism and constructivism."
5930,从某种意义上来说，这是关于后现代主义争论的一种延续，但是那些接受了社会建构主义预设的人涵盖了更为广泛的理论观点，而不仅仅是文本主义的后现代主义。,"In a sense, this was a continuation of the argument about postmodernism, but those who accept the premises of social constructivism cover a much wider range of theoretical positions than just textualist postmodernism."
5931,在受怀特影响的大量学者中间，马文·哈里斯（Marvin Harris）在他自己的理论中坚持唯物主义决定论，他称之为文化唯物主义，而萨林斯（Marshall Sahlins）在1960年代做出了从新进化论到受结构主义影响的符号人类学的转变。,"Among the major scholars influenced by White, Marvin Harris has retained the materialist determinism in his own theory, which he calls cultural materialism, while Marshall Sahlins in the 1960s made the move from neo-evolutionism to a symbolic anthropology influenced by structuralism."
5931,文化生态学，很大程度上是北美的特产，源于斯图尔德和怀特的学说，代表了一种在人类学和生物学之间进行的罕见合作。,"Cultural ecology, largely a North American speciality, sprang from the teachings of Steward and White, and represented a rare collaboration between anthropology and biology."
5931,特别是在1960年代，这类研究很多：最著名的无疑是拉帕波特（Roy Rappaport）的《献给祖先的猪》（Pigs for the Ancestors，1968），它试图从生态学的角度去解释新几内亚高地一种反复出现的仪式。,"Especially in the 1960s, many such studies were carried out; the most famous is doubtless Roy Rappaport's Pigs for the Ancestors (1968), an attempt to account for a recurrent ritual in the New Guinean highlands in ecological terms."
5931,另外，在1970年代，尤其是在拉美地区，马克思主义者的农民研究的高潮，明显也要归功于斯图尔德。,"However, the upsurge of Marxist peasant research, especially in Latin America, in the 1970s, was clearly also indebted to Steward."
5932,并且，那份工作可能会使他们长时间分开。,"Furthermore, their work may keep them away for prolonged periods."
5932,如果夫妻双方都是雇工（这种情况越来越多，因为夫妇们发现只靠一个人的收入越来越难以维持自己所希望达到的生活标准），“工作指向哪里就到哪里”的要求可能会把丈夫和妻子引往不同的方向。最主要的是，新居制往往要求夫妇两人与双方的亲戚都要分开。,"If both spouses are employed, (as is increasingly the case, since couples find it ever more difficult to maintain their desired standard of living on one income), the requirement for workers to go where their jobs take them may pull the husband and wife in different directions.On top of all this, neolocal residence tends to isolate husbands and wives from both sets of kin."
5932,因为在夫妻之间不再存在清楚确定的责任模式了，所以他们必须为自己建立这些模式。,"Because clearly established patterns of responsibility no longer exist between husbands and wives, couples must work these out for themselves."
5933,新闻写作和文学很难描述，因为它们较少有明确的学术规范，主要是察觉和讲述被视作值得看和听的不论什么东西。,"The writing of journalism and literature is difficult to characterize, for these are less academic disciplines than ways of perceiving and telling about whatever is deemed worth seeing and hearing."
5933,不过，我们还是可以从中看出一些倾向。,"Still, certain tendencies can be noted."
5933,标准的头版头条新闻的目标是“ 得到新闻”。,"Standard front-page journalism is aimed at ""getting the news""."
5933,就像沃夫（Evelyn Waugh）的Scoop一书中幽默地描绘的，那一努力可能会将新闻工作者置于一个异乎寻常的地方，但他通常不会发现有必要甚或有可能深入当地社区成为其中的一部分，通常，进入社区，得到故事，随后他就会离开那里。,"As humorously depicted in Evelyn Waugh’s Scoop, that endeavor may locate the journalist in exotic places, but he does not usually find it necessary or even possible to become deeply part of the local community; normally, he moves in, gets his story, and moves out."
5934,在英语里，“房子”和“猫”这两个词适合这一框架，我们说它们属 于同一形式类，但“思考”一词则不适合这一框架。,"In English, the words house and cat will fit this frame and can be said to belong to the same form class, but the word think will not."
5934,"另一种对名词来说可能的替换框架可能是“……死了”，“猫”这个词适合这一框架,而“房子”则不适合。","Another possible substitution frame for nouns might be ""The died"", in which the word will fit, but not the word bouse."
5934,因此，我们可以识别出我们名词的子类：在这种情况中，我们可以称之为“有生命的”或“无 生命的”子类。,"Thus the linguist can identify subclasses of English nouns: in this case, ""animate"" or ""inanimate"" subclasses."
5934,对该语言的所有词汇可以按同样的程序处理，使用必要的许多不同的框架，一直到我们有一本准确描述该语言所有词汇可能用法的词典或字典。,"The same procedure can be followed for ail the words of the language, using as many different frames as necessary, until a lexicon, or dictionary, can be created that accurately describes the possible uses of all the words in the language."
5935,性别分层的产生似乎通常看起来与高度集权国家的发展相联系。,The rise of gender stratification often seems to be associated with the development of strongly centralized states.
5935,例如，在中美洲的玛雅人中，过去和现在的基本社会单位是互补的性別对子。,"For example, among the Maya of Central America the basic social unit in the past and today is the complementary gender pair."
5935,在家户这一层面，男子种植庄稼并买进其他原材料，妇女把它们变成食物、织物和其他文化物品。,"On the household level, men raise the crops and bring in the other raw materials the women transform into food, textiles, and other cultural objects."
5935,同样的互补性也存在于礼仪和政治当中，但在公元前最后一个世纪，在玛雅的蒂卡尔城，事情开始发生变化。,"The same complementarity existed in public ritual and politics, but in the last century B.C. at the Maya city of Tikal, this situation began to change."
5936,人们期望该妇女与其女性丈夫角色保持一致，放宑女性性别身份，而理想的做法是像男子一样穿着和行为。,"In keeping with her role as female husband, this woman is expected to abandon her female gender identity and, ideally, dress and behave as a man."
5936,实际上，这种理想没有完全实现，因为一生的习性难以彻底改变。,"In practice, the ideal is not completely achieved, for the habits of a lifetime are difficult to reverse."
5936,一般说来，只是在家庭最具有性别身份象征意义的活动情境中，女性丈夫才彻底完全装扮成男性身份。,"Generally, it is in the context of domestic activities, which are most highly symbolic of female identity, that female husbands most completely assume a male identity."
5936,女一女婚姻当事方的各个个体都享有一些利益。,The individuals who are parties to woman/woman marriages enjoy several advantages.
5936,通过取得男性身份，不育的或无子的妇女在很大程度上提高了自己的地位，甚至达到接近与男子平等的地位，南迪社会的男子在其他方面比妇女占有更加优越的地位。,"By assuming a male identity, a barren or sonless woman raises her status considerably and even achieves near equality with men, who otherwise occupy a far more favored position in Nandi society than women."
5937,在灵长目动物中，人类女性从事性活动的能力非同寻常，只要她想要或她的文化告诉她合适就行，不考虑她是否在受孕期。,"Among primates, the human female is unique in her ability to engage in sexual behavior whenever she wants to or whenever her culture tells her it is appropriate, irrespective of whether or not she is fertile."
5937,虽然这种活动可能强化个体之间的社会联系，但性接触权的竞争也有破坏性，因此，任何社会都有控制性接触的规则，乱伦禁忌几乎是普遍的，它禁止父母与其子女之间的性关系，通常也禁止同胞兄弟姐妹之间的性关系。长期以来，人类学家一直对乱伦禁忌有兴趣，但是还没有提出对禁忌的真正令人信服的解释。,"Although such activity may reinforce social bonds between men and women, competition for sexual access also can be disruptive, so every society has rules that govern such access.The near universality of the incest taboo, which forbids sexual relations between parents and their children, and usually between siblings, long has interested anthropologists, but a truly convincing explanation of the taboo has yet to be advanced."
5938,如马其顿宪法的通过遭到占30%人口的阿尔巴尼亚人强烈反对。,"The Macedonian constitution, for example, was strongly opposed by and passed without the consent of its 30 percent Albanian minority."
5938,克罗地亚宪法受到塞尔维亚人、斯洛文尼亚人、斯洛伐克人、匈牙利人和穆斯林的批评。,"The Croatian constitution was criticised by its Serb, Slovene, Slovak, Hungarian and Muslim minorities."
5938,以色列、马来西亚、泰国和其他国家民族身份的定义，引起了阿拉伯人、非马来人和非泰人类似的反对。,"The Israeli, Malaysian, Thai and other definitions of national identity have provoked similar objections respectively from their Arab, nonMalay and non-Thai minorities."
5939,关于虚假意识的问题，人类学家几乎没有必要采取一种什么立场。,It is rarely necessary for an anthropologist to take a stance regarding the issue of false consciousness.
5939,当我们用比较的方法研究政治系统时，通常没有必要决定这个群体在其世界观和意识形态上是“对的”还是“错的”。,"When we study political systems comparatively, it is usually unnecessary to decide whether the group is ""right"" or ""wrong"" in its world-view and ideology."
5939,毕竟，对政治进行的人类学比较研究涉及说明政治系统是如何发挥功能的，以及在政治系统内部人们是如何行动或被阻止行动的，同时还要展示意识形态和社会实践之间的关系。,"Above all, the comparative anthropological study of politics is concerned with showing how political systems function and how people act or are prevented from acting within them, as well as indicating the relationship between ideology and social practice."
5939,不过，我们应该记住，行动者很少能够看到全局和他们的行动后果，而人类学家的分析任务之一就在于解决这一问题。,"It should nevertheless be kept in mind that actors rarely see the full context and consequences of their acts, and that the anthropologist's analytical task consists in working this out."
5940,"丹尼尔˙丹尼特（Danniel Denett),《被解释的意识》（1991): 大脑是一个“预测机器'根据“平行分布的程序”规则运作。","Daniel Dennett, Consciousness Explained (1991): the brain is an ""anticipation machine"", working on a principle of ""parallel distributed processing""."
5940,意识是一种幻象，是一系列的“多元转换”的提升，并不存在“叙事重心”，也没有连续性。,"Consciousness is an illusion, a series of shifting ""multiple drafts"" with no ""centre of narrative gravity"" and no continuity."
5940,不存在笛卡尔所谓的心灵剧场使“我是”汇集在一起；而感官经验和看待事物的方式远不是不可言说或完全主观性的。,"There is no Cartesian theatre where ""I am"" comes together; moreover, the qualia of experience, the way things seem, are far from ineffable or merely subjective."
5941,炫耀性消费的形式也发生在某些寻食社会和农耕社会中，就如北美西北沿海地带的印第安人的夸富宴，或在巴布亚新几内亚许多社会中头人所设的慷慨宴席所说明的。,"A form of conspicuous consumption also occurs in some nonindustrial societies, as illustrated by the potlatches Indians on the Northwest Coast of North America give or the lavish feasts Big Men in many societies of Papua New Guinea give."
5941,在这两种情况里，在以前数月内辛勤积累的食品和其他各种财富，公开赠送给他人。,"In both cases, food and various other items of wealth, laboriously accumulated over several preceding months, are all given away to others."
5941,西方的观察者往往将这种富丽堂皇的展示视作极大的浪费，这就是加拿大政府数年来一直抑制夸富宴的一个理由。,"Western observers are apt to see such grandiose displays as wasteful in the extreme, which is one reason why the Canadian government sought for many decades to suppress potlatches."
5941,"然而，对参与其中的人来说, 这些赠品实现了重要的社会和政治目标，就如下面的分析所证明的那样。","To the people involved, however, these giveaways accomplish important social and political goals, as the following analysis demonstrates."
5942,一个世系群(比如霍皮人的世系群或中国的宗族)是一个由血缘亲属组成的法人继嗣群体，这些亲属经由已知的联系环节，按系谱追溯他们源自共同袓先的血统。,A lineage (such as those of the Hopi or the Chinese tsu) is a corporate descent group composed of consanguineal kin who trace descent genealogically through known links back to a common ancestor.
5942,世系群这个术语通常用于单系继嗣形式是惯例的地方，但有些两可系继嗣群体也与此相似，就像刚刚讨论过的犹太人家庭圈。,"The term is usually employed where a form of unilineal descent is the rule, but some ambilineal groups are similar, such as the Jewish family circles just discussed."
5942,世系群重视祖先，群体成员只要与共同祖先的关系得到证明就能得到承认。,The lineage is ancestor oriented; membership in the group is recognized only if relationship to a common ancestor can be traced and proved.
5942,在很多社会，个体除了作为世系群的成员之外，没有其他的法律或政治地位。,In many societies an individual has no legal or political status except as a lineage member.
5943,寻食是最古老、最普遍类型的人类调适。,Food foraging is the oldest and most universal type of human adaptation.
5943,我们应把社会组织的重要要素归功于性別分工、食物分享，以及作为日常活动中心的大本营，而且在那里实现食物的分享。,"To it we owe such important elements of social organization as the sexual division of labor, food sharing, and a home base as the center of daily activity and where food sharing is accomplished."
5943,完全不同的调适，包括农业和畜牧业，在世界某些地区在9000—11000年前开始发展起来。,"Quite different adaptations, involving farming and animal husbandry, began to develop in some parts of the world between 9,000 and 11,000 years ago."
5943,借助于简单的手工工具种植家用植物的园艺，使比较永久的定居以及分工的重组成为可能在畜牧条件下，依靠放牧的家畜群，游牧生活得以持续，但是与其他民族互动的新模式发展起来了。,"Horticulture—the cultivation of domestic plants with simple hand tools—made possible more permanent settlements and a reorganization of the division of labor Under pastoralism—reliance on raising herds of domestic animalsnomadism continued, but new modes of interaction with other peoples were developed."
5944,男人娶第二个妻子的另一个理由是要证明他们在社会中的地位。,Another reason for a man to take on secondary wives is to demonstrate his high position in society.
5944,但是，在男人并不做大部分生产性工作的地方，他们必须特别勤奋地工作以供养多个妻子，实际上很少有人供养得起。,"But where men do most of the productive work, they must work exceptionally hard to support more than one wife, and few actually do so."
5944,一般来说，在寻食社会中出色的猎手或男性萨满教萨满(“医师”），或者在农业或游牧社会中特别富裕的人，最易于实行一夫多妻制。,"Usually, it is the exceptional hunter, a male shaman (""medicine man"") in a food-foraging society, or a particularly wealthy man in an agricultural or pastoral society who is most apt to practice polygyny.When he does, it is usually of the sororal type, with the cowives being sisters."
5944,他娶多个妻子，经常是姐妹型的，共夫妻子是姐妹。由于婚前她们就生活在一起了，姐妹们继续这样与其丈夫一起生活，而不是占有其自己独立的住宅。,"Having already lived together before marriage, the sisters continue to do so with their husband, instead of occupying separate dwellings of their own."
5945,在门诺派的严谨派中，人们可以看到美国亚文化的一个例子。门诺派严谨派老会社在16世纪新教革命席卷欧洲时起源于中欧；今天该会社的成员数约6万人，大部分生活在宾夕法尼亚州、俄亥俄州和印第安纳州。,"One example of a subculture in the United States can be seen in the Amish.The old-order Amish originated in Austria and Moravia during the Reformation; today members of this order number about 60,000 and live mainly in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana."
5945,他们是和平主义者、平均地权论者，他们生活的宗旨是其宗教信仰。,"They are pacifistic, agrarian people whose lives focus on their religious beliefs."
5945,他们珍视简朴、勤勉工作和高度的邻里合作。,"They value simplicity, hard work, and a high degree of neighborly cooperation."
5945,他们穿着独特的、朴素的服装，甚至今天还依靠马匹来运输和干农活。,The Amish dress in a distinctive plain garb and even today rely on the horse for transportation as well as agricultural work.
5945,他们几乎不可能与非门诺派严谨派的人联姻。,They mingle as little as possible with the non-Amish.
5946,这就是研究者为什么会被言词评价误导的一个原因，因为人们所说的可能并不完全与社会现实相符。,"This is one reason why a researcher may be misled by verbal evaluation, for what people say may not correspond completely with social reality."
5946,例如，埃及的官方语言是古典阿拉伯语——《古兰经》(伊斯兰教最神圣的文本)的语言。,"As an example, the official language of Egypt is Classical Arabic, the language of the Quran (the most holy of Islamic texts)."
5946,尽管这种语言被赋予很髙的价值，但在埃及没有人在日常交往中使用它，人们只在官方文件或正式场合才使用它。,"Though it is highly valued, no one in Egypt uses this language in daily interaction; rather, it is used for official documents or on formal occasions."
5946,那些熟练掌握这种语言的人不是上层阶级的，而是中下层阶级的。,"Those most proficient in it are nor of the upper class but, rather, of the lower-middle classes."
5946,"这些人在公立学校中接受教育（在那里,古典阿拉伯语是学校教育的语言），并在政府官僚部门供职（那里要求使用古典阿拉伯语的场合最多）。",These are the people educated in the public schools (where Classical Arabic is the language of schooling) and who hold jobs in the government bureaucracy (which requires the most use of Classical Arabic).
5947,事实上，明了正确的言语方式的能力展现了一个人成为社区中完整意义上的成员的资格。,"Indeed, competency in knowing appropriate styles of speaking may represent one of the primary determinants by a community of its full members."
5947,构成不同言语环境的是“言语事件”，即不同角色的扮演者的不同部分，而构成言语事件的是个体的“言语行动”。,"Making up different speech situations will be ""speech events""—the different parts of the different role-players—and constitutive of speech-events will be individual ""speech-acts""."
5947,后者亦在社会背景中被形式化，以便形式与内容能够和环境与情景、说者和发言者、听者和受众、目的和目标、“要素”（语调、风格或情绪）“渠道”（口头的或书面的）和流派类型（祈祷、谚语、诗歌或演讲）这些融为一体。,"These latter too will be formalized within the group context so that form and content will gel with setting and scene, speaker and addresser, addressee and audience, purpose and goal, ""key""(tone, manner or spirit)""channel"" (oral or written) and genre (prayer, say, poem or lecture)."
5948,尽管非洲南部的岩石艺术经常被轻蔑地贴上“原始”和“简单”的标签，但这里的讨论表明：它绝非如此。无论这种艺术本身，还是嵌入其中的信仰系统，都不能被描述成是远古“简单”。,"Although southern African rock art is all too often dismissively labeled as ""primitive' or ""simple,"" the discussion here shows that it is anything but. Neither the art itself nor the belief system it embedded in can be described as remotely ""simple."
5948,要理解这样一种艺术，只盯着一幅画看是不够的，这需要花很多功夫，但为此付出努力是值得的。,""" Understanding such art requires a good deal more than simply staring at a picture, but the effort is well worth making."
5949,"一夫一妻制，或接纳一个配偶,是最普遍的婚姻形式，首先是由于经济的原因。","Monogamy, or the taking of a single spouse, is the most common form of marriage, primarily for economic reasons."
5949,一个男子必须有一定量的财富才负担得起一夫多妻制的费用，在同一时间娶不止一个妻子。,"A man must have a certain amount of wealth to afford polygyny, or marriage to more than one wife at the same time."
5949,然而，在妇女做大量生产性工作的社会中，一夫多妻制可作为一种手段，为家户增添财富。,"Yet in societies where women do most of the productive work, polygyny may serve as a means of generating wealth for a household."
5950,一夫一妻制是北美人最熟悉的婚姻形式。,Monogamy is the form of marriage North Americans are most familiar with.
5950,由于经济而非道德的原因，它也是最普遍的婚姻形式。,"It is also the most common, but for economic rather than moral reasons."
5950,在许多实行一夫多妻制的社会中，一个男子必须足够的富裕才负担得起一夫多妻（monogamy），即娶一个以上妻子的费用。,"In many polygynous societies, a man must be fairly wealthy to afford polygyny, or marriage to more than one wife."
5950,在新几内亚西部的长保库人中，理想是尽可能多地拥有妻子，而且一个女子实际上鼓励她的丈夫花钱娶另外的妻子。,"Among the Kapauku of western New Guinea, the ideal is to have as many wives as possible and a woman actually urges her husband to spend money on acquiring additional wives."
5950,如果她能证明他有聘礼的钱而拒不再娶，她甚至有法律上的权利与他离婚。,She even has the legal right to divorce him if she can prove he has money for bride-prices and refuses to remarry.
5951,依附训练（dependence training）增进在执行指派任务时的顺从性，并鼓励个体留在群体内部。,Dependence training promotes compliance in the performance of assigned tasks and favors keeping individuals within the group.
5951,这一模式一般与扩大家庭有关。这种扩大家庭由在同一象户内部的几个丈夫一妻子一孩子的单位构成，在主要以自耕自给农业为经济基础的社会里最容易看到。,"This pattern is typically associated with extended families, which consist of several husband-wife-children units within the same household and which are most apt to be found in societies with an economy based on subsistence farming."
5951,这种家庭是十分重要的，因为它们为耕作土地、照料饲养的牲畜以及其他他们认为生存所必需的副业经济事务提供必要的大量劳动力。,"Such families are important, for they provide the large labor force necessary to rill the soil, tend whatever flocks are kept, and carry out other part-time economic pursuits considered necessary for existence."
5951,然而，这些大家庭本身形成某种潜在的破坏性紧张关系。,"These large families, however, have built into them certain potentially disruptive tensions."
5952,小心翼翼地为了避免陷入一种过于简单的还原主义的解释，布洛克可能比任何更早些的人类学家更加谨慎地分析了仪式的意识形态的维度。,"Careful to avoid a simplistic reductionist explanation, Bloch analysed the ideological dimension of ritual perhaps more carefully than any earlier anthropologist."
5952,他的主要观点之一，与很多其他人类学家一样，认为仪式和仪式符号论被迫显得模糊不清，是因为它们代表了一个充满了矛盾的社会世界，所以，“意识形态的信息不能简单地作为一种陈述而被主张……因为从它最真实的本性来说，是与人类在世界的经验相矛盾的”（Bloch 1986，p.195）。,"One of his main points, which he shares with many other anthropologists, is that rituals and ritual symbolism have to be ambiguous because they are representations of a social world that is contradictionridden.So ""the message of ideology cannot be maintained simply as a statement... because it is by its very nature in contradiction with human experience in the world"" (Bloch 1986, p. 195)."
5952,这很重要，意识形态总是简单化的并且利用了等级制度和特定的社会秩序。,This is important.Ideology always simplifies and imposes hierarchy and a particular social order.
5952,在梅日纳的例子中，作为受到被割礼仪式影响的意识形态，也被用来证明典礼用的暴力是正当的。,"In the case of the Merina, ideology as mediated by the circumcision ritual also served to justify state violence."
5952,仪式的迂回的意识形态维度，在现代国家社会中和它在非现代国家中一样明显（参见Handelman 1990）。,"In modern state societies, the oblique ideological dimension of ritual is no less evident than in non-modern societies (see Handelman 1990)."
5953,种姓的首领因而努力要将他们的经济资本转化成仪式化洁净度。,The leaders of the caste thus tried to convert their economic capital into ritual purity.
5953,首先他们必须通过被总称为梵语化（sanskritisation）的过程使自己的行为得到净化，他们还要停止举行低级种姓的典型仪式行为（例如动物献祭），同时，在其他方面要采取婆罗门教的规范，成为素食者，等等。,"First they had to purify their own practices through what is generally known as Sanskritisation.They ceased to perform typical low-caste rituals (such as animal sacrifice) and adopted Brahmanic rules in other respects as well, becoming vegetarians and so on."
5953,不过，制酒者想要被认可为高级种姓，还需要提高在贾吉摩尼系统内部的地位，而这是最困难的部分。,"For the distillers to be recognised as a high caste, however, they also had to improve their position within the jajmani system, and this was the most difficult part."
5953,和肮脏的制酒者一起进入贾吉摩尼关系的每一个种姓在当地等级组织中都有被他们超越的风险；另一方面，制酒者有足够的金钱能够支付各种服务。,"Each caste which entered into a jajmani relationship with the polluting distillers risked being surpassed by them in the local hierarchy; on the other hand, the distillers were able to pay well for services."
5953,最后，他们成功地——在超越了阶梯的好几个梯级以后——使婆罗门为他们施行了仪式服务，并因此被认为成为了一个干净的种姓，但是他们付出了大量的金钱作为代价，他们将高级经济地位转换成了高级仪式地位。,"Eventually they succeeded – after having passed through several rungs on the ladder – in having Brahmins perform ritual services for them and were thereby considered a clean caste, but at the cost of a considerable amount of money.They converted a high economic position into a high ritual position."
5954,我只讨论了三种产生或延续族裔差异的外在压力——法律和政治的限制、强制移民的后果和类型学外貌划分。,"I have discussed only three kinds of exogenous pressures that serve to create or perpetuate ethnic differences – legal and political restrictions, the consequences of coerced migration, and phenotypical appearances."
5954,但是含义是清楚的。,But the implication is clear.
5954,族裔差异通常是被迫的——或者至少是强力引导的——选择的方式也有限。,Ethnic differences are often compelled – or at least strongly induced – and are only in a limited way chosen.
5955,它更多地是一个个人经验问题以及用动态多元的方式指代外界的问题。,It is more a question of personal experience and of the dynamic and multiple ways of referring to the external world.
5955,事实上，起源于欧洲的多元文化主义问题是由于从（上个世纪——译者）60年代起，突然从第三世界涌入了成千上万的大批移民欧洲。,"In fact the question of multiculturalism has arisen in Europe, since the sixties, through the sudden and massive influx of millions of immigrants from the Third World."
5955,这些移民大部分（并不是所有情况下）有着非常不同的文化、语言和宗教背景。,"These immigrants had, for the most part (but not in all cases), a very different background of culture, languages and religion."
5956,然而，它们中没有一部作品仅仅是控诉，也确实没有一部作品只谴责了自我和族群之外的压迫者。所有人都想象性地描述了新的身份和世界的创造。,"None of these, however, merely indicts, and certainly none blames only oppressors outside the self and ethnic group; all Actively demonstrate the creation of new identities and worlds."
5956,并非幼稚地致力于直接再现，而是暗承或召唤文化的生成（emergence)(参见本书中泰勒的文章）。,"Rather than naive efforts at direct representation, they suggest or evoke cultural emergence (see Tyler in this volume)."
5956,这些描述是那么套式化，具有相对感，一个原因是，他们都关注文本技巧的无效性（ineffectiveness）——也就是对这些技巧有意识的使用：移情、梦的转译、讲故事、多声音和多视角、突出幽默的颠覆和多个身份/传统/文化的辩证并置，以及对覇权话语的批评。,"One of the reasons for the relative sense that these portraits are less stereotyped is their attention to the ineffectiveness of textual techniques — that is, the self-conscious employment of such devices as transference, dream-translation, talk-story, multiple voices and perspectives, the highlighting of humorous inversions and dialectical juxtaposition of identities/traditions/cultures, and the critique of hegemonic discourses."
5957,关于涵化的最极端的例子，通常是军事征服、大规模入侵的后果，新来的统治者摧毁传统的政治结构，他们对他们所控制的文化一无所知或者毫不关心。,The most extreme cases of acculturation usually occur as a result of military conquest and displacement of traditional political authority by conquerors who know or care nothing about the culture they control.
5957,原住民不 能有效地抵制强加给他们的这些变化，而且这些变化阻碍他们开展很多传统的社会、宗教和经济活动，他们还可能被迫进行往往会孤立个人和破坏社会整合的新活动。,"The indigenous people, unable to resist imposed changes and prevented from carrying out many of their traditional social, religious, and economic activities, may be forced into new activities that tend to isolate individuals and tear apart the integration of their societies."
5957,纳米比亚的朱瓦西人就是这样的一个民族，他们于20世纪60年代早期被集中起来，并被驱逐到一块保留地里去，在那里，他们不能满足自己的各种生活需要。,"Such a people are the Juhoansi of Namibia, who were rounded up in the early 1960s and confined to a reserve where they could not possibly provide for their own needs."
5958,遗产涉及财产的传递，而继承与“职责的传递”有关（Rivers 1924），即根据所属的身份传递特定的权利和义务。,"Inheritance concerns the transmission of property, while succession refers to ""the transmission of office"" (Rivers 1924); transmission of specified rights and duties as ascribed statuses."
5958,所有社会都有管理条例规定：当某人死后，谁会继承什么，虽然这些条例常有不同方式的争议或解释。,"All societies have rules regulating who is to inherit what when someone dies, although these rules are often contested or interpreted in varying ways."
5958,不同的社会中，亲属制度系统和遗产规则之间没有普遍联系。,There is no universal link between the kinship system and the rules of inheritance in societies.
5958,有的是按照父系继嗣的系统，男人和女人在遗产方面是平等的；有的是对某种性别给以优先权的遗产继承系统，通常是对男性优先；在一些社会，长子比其他子女会继承更大部分的遗产（长子继承制）；另一些社会遵循相反的准则，对幼子给以优先权（幼子继承制）。,"There are patrilineal systems of descent where men and women are equals in terms of inheritance, and there are systems which give priority to one of the genders, usually the male.In some societies the eldest son receives a larger part of the inheritance than his siblings (primogeniture); others follow the opposite principle and give priority to the youngest son (ultimogeniture)."
5959,异教信仰的概念与非基督教信仰相联系，尤其又与非基督教信仰表达宗教内容的公共仪式有联系。,"The concept of paganism was associated with non-Christian religions and, in particular, their practices of public rituals which expressed aspects of the content of the religion."
5959,迷信的概念大部分用来描述世界上的那些既不是科学、权威的宗教也不是“常识”能够解释的看不见的关系。,"The concept of superstition was largely reserved for descriptions of invisible interrelationships in the world which neither science, authorised religion nor ""common sense"" could account for."
5959,从这个角度看，伊斯兰和非洲的祖先崇拜都将被划归异教信仰的领地，而特罗布里恩德岛民相信他们会因为巫术而死以及地中海等地区的人认为某些人拥有邪恶的眼睛之类的常见观念，都是迷信思想的体现。,"From this kind of perspective, Islam and African ancestral cults would be located in the domain of paganism, while, say, the Trobriand islanders' belief that they die because of witchcraft and the common notion, in the Mediterranean region and elsewhere, that some persons are possessed by the evil eye, would be expressions of superstition."
5959,在当代人类学中，这对应着经常被援引的宗教和知识之间的区别。,"In contemporary anthropology, this corresponds to a frequently invoked distinction between religion and knowledge."
5959,宗教从而可以被说成是包括了公共的超自然力量的社会信仰形式，并且通过仪式得到公共表达。,Religion may thereby be said to include forms of social belief in supernatural powers which are public and which are given public expression through rituals.
5960,洛克曾说，意识可以定义为：“运动中的思维，既认识到它自身的形态”，又能在遇到冲击和变化时维持这一形态”（Ellmannn 1977: 1）。,"To elaborate upon Locke, consciousness may be defined as denoting:‘the movement of the mind both in recognizing its own shape and in maintaining that shape in the face of attack or change’ (Ellmann 1977:1)."
5960,它包括感觉、认知、情绪、情感、倾向性的个人态度状况以及叙事结构（Flanagan 1992: 213），而且它是具体的：思维不能脱离躯体而存在。,"It includes sensations, perceptions, moods, emotions, propositional-attitudinal states, and narrative structures (Flanagan 1992:213), and it is embodied: there can be no mind without a body."
5960,或许意识最独特的特征是它能认知自己：我们意识到自己的意识。,Perhaps the diacritical feature of consciousness is its awareness of itself: we are conscious about being conscious.
5961,作为被限制的领域，社会依然是分析单位，虽然马克思主义称社会为“社会构成”（social formation)。,"Societies as bounded universes remained the units of analysis, though they were called by their Marxian term, ‘social formations’."
5961,同样，称文化为“意识形态”，经济为“生产方式”。,"Likewise, culture became ‘ideology’, and the economy was the ‘mode of production’."
5961,结构马克思主义与功能主义在许多方面也有共同点，两者都强调仪式和世系组织等的共时性特征和功能性特征。,"Structural Marxism had much in common with functionalism too, as both emphasized the synchronic and the functional qualities of ritual, lineage organization, and so on."
5962,假设在1823年-1827年，或1833年至1837年的欧洲，还没有人有足够的智能形成能量守恒定律；而到1843年才出现了头一个这样的人。到1847年才接着出现了四个以上富于这种智能的人，这是对或然率法则的严峻考验。,"To assume that there was no one in Europe with sufficient mental ability to formulate the Law of Conservation of Energy in 1823-27, or in 1833-37, but that in 1843 one such person appeared only to be followed by four more in 1847, is to put a severe strain upon the laws of chance."
5962,而文化学解释却作出了非常适当的假设。,"The culturological interpretation, however, makes very modest assumptions."
5963,有很多方式可以说明社会内部的知识和技能的差异。,There are many ways of accounting for differences in skills and knowledge within societies.
5963,女性主义者的方式倾向于接受这样一到两种论点：（1）女人体验世界的方式与男人不同，因为她们是女人；（2）让有价值的社会技能远离女人是符合父权制（男性规则）的利益的。,Feminists have tended to follow one or both of two lines of argument: (1) women experience the world differently from men because they are women; (2) it is in the interest of patriarchy (male rule) to keep socially valuable skills away from women.
5963,由马克思主义所激励的分析倾向于将知识和技能的研究与权力和意识形态的研究相联系（参见第九章和第十四章），而由涂尔干所激励的社会人类学家则会将这些差异与劳动分工相联系，由此对社会一体化有所贡献。,"Analyses inspired by Marxism tend to link the study of knowledge and skills to that of power and ideology (see Chapters 9, 11 and 14), while social anthropologists inspired by Durkheim may relate such differences to the division of labour, which thereby contributes to the integration of society."
5963,还应该注意到，“有价值的知识”的说法，以及更加广泛地，对世界的真正的定义，是一种权力的形式（参见Bourdieu 1982；同样参见第十五章）。,"It should be noted that the designation of ""valuable knowledge"" and, more generally, the very definition of the world, is a form of power (see Bourdieu 1982; see also Chapter 15)."
5964,或许研究人权的人类学提供了一种途径。,Perhaps an anthropology of human rights offers a way forward.
5964,关于人权的话语和法规中最常见的是“跨国界的公正过程”（Wilson 1997: 9），人类学可以以一种新的方式研究这些权利，即“最普遍的世界意识形态”（Weissbrodt 1988：1）。,"For, in highlighting the discourse and the laws surrounding human rights as ‘transnational juridical processes’ (Wilson 1997:9), anthropology can point the way towards an appreciation of such rights as perhaps ‘the worlds first universal ideology’ (Weissbrodt 1988:1)."
5964,也就是说，人权，作为一种话语和法律，可以看成是政治进程的一种具体的形态，其中包含了全球自由政治和公正的思想（Rorty 1986）。,"That is, human rights, as discourse and law, can be seen as a concrete form of political procedure on which a global liberal polity and justice is to be founded (cf. Rorty 1986)."
5965,摒弃因果论对人类学从业者审视人类学的方式有重大影响。,The abandonment of causality had a significant effect on the way anthropology is viewed by its practitioners.
5965,在20世纪早期，人类学与其他社会科学都为确立自己作为一门解释性和预测性学科的学术地位而努力。,"In the early part of this century it had struggled, alongside other social sciences, to establish its status as an explanatory and predictive discipline."
5965,文化现象具有原因的假设——无论是环境的（如第二章所讨论的一些模式）还是社会的（如道格拉斯的模式）都能够使人类学家声言，只要找出这些原因他们就可以对他们所研究的文化做出确定的或最终的解释。,"The assumption that cultural phenomena have causes—be they environmental, as in some of the models discussed in Chapter 2, orsocial, as in Douglas' model—enabled anthropologists to claim that, by identifying those causes, they were explaining culture insome final and definitive sense."
5965,如果选择一旦成为分析文化的核心概念，人类学家就这不那么有把握声称他们的分析能够得出确定的解释了,
5966,每种语言都会在声音上分辨出数量很小但却绝对是很重要的区别（有些语言会少到只有12个，没有超过90个的，英语有约40个）；这些区分就是音素。,"Every language identifies a small number of distinctions in sound (some languages have as few as a dozen, none has more than ninety, English has about forty) that are absolutely critical; these distinctions are phonemes."
5966,只要它们被呈现出来并被理解，交流就会发生。,"So long as these are produced and understood, communication can occur."
5966,例如，在英语中，发言人区分“b”“p”之间的不同是很有必要的（否则他会混淆“pin”与“bin”、“bull”与“pull”、“pan”与“ban”）。,"For example, in English it is necessary that the speaker distinguish between ""b"" and ""p"" (otherwise he would confuse ""pin"" and ""bin"", ""bull"" and ""pull"", ""pan"" and ""ban"")."
5966,但他没有必要作出所有的区分。,It is not necessary that he make all possible distinctions.
5967,“emic”一词的准确意义长期以来一直存在争议。,The precise meaning of ‘emic’ has long been a subject of debate.
5967,"哈里斯认为 (Harris, 1968: 568 -604)它可以被看作是报道人（informant)的陈述，但派克却强调音位系统的结构特征（Pike 1967: 37 -72)。","Harris (1968: 568-604) saw it essentially as equatable with informants’ state- ments, whereas Pike (1967: 37-72) emphasized instead the structured nature of the emic system."
5967,正如报道人不能描述隐藏在他们自己所使用的语言中的语法规则一样，他们也可能无法描述隐含在文化理解和实践中的主位系统。,"Just as informants cannot necessarily describe the grammatical rules behind their own use of language, so too they might be unable to describe the emic system which underlies their cultural understandings and practices."
5967,因此，探索音位/主位系统是分析家而不是报道人的任务。,"The discovery of that system is the task of the analyst, not the informant."
5968,"语言学是人类学家、心理学家和其他科学家对于语言各方面的现代科学研究，语音学专门研究语音,或音位的产生、传播和接受。","Linguistics is the modern scientific study of all aspects of language.Phonetics focuses on the production, transmission, and reception of speechsounds, or phonemes."
5968,音系学研究语言的声音模式， 旨在引申出支配语音组合方式的规则。,Phonology studies the sound patterns of language to extract the rules that govern the way sounds are combined.
5968,形态学关心语言中声音组合的最小意义单位——词素。,Morphology is concerned with the smallest units of meaningful combinations of sounds—morphemes—in a language.
5968,句法涉及一些原则，短语和句子根据这些原则构成。,Syntax refers to the principles phrases and sentences are built with.
5968,语言的完整形式结构构成语言的语法，它由关于语言的词素和句法的所有观察资料组成。,"The entire formal structure of a language, consisting of all observations about its morphemes and syntax, constitutes its grammar."
5968,人类语言根植于我们从灵长目动物祖先继承来的姿势一呼叫系统。姿势一呼叫系统起到“为”言语“定基调”的作用，为解释语言形式提供合适的框架。,"Human language is embedded in a gesture-call system inherited from our primate ancestors that serves to ""key"" speech，providing the appropriate frame for interpreting linguistic form."
5968,这一系统的姿势成分由用来传递信息的身体运动组成；把这些身体运动做成标记并记录下来的系统叫作声势学。,The gestural component of this system consists of body motions used to convey messages; the system of notating and recording these motions is known as kinesics.
5968,辅助语言代表呼叫成分，它是由包括各种各样音质和发嗓音的语言外声音构成的。,"The call component is represented by paralanguage, consisting of extralinguistic noises involving various voice qualities and vocalizations."
5969,这些交叉分割的纽带创造了不能被简化为单纯的同心圆的效忠的复杂系统，却也减低了不同家系之间的世仇的危险度。,"These cross-cutting ties, which create complex systems of loyalties that cannot be reduced to mere concentric circles, reduce the danger of feuds between lineages."
5969,地方社区通过父系家族关系、母系家族关系和姻亲而得以扩充（Gluckman 1982 [1956]）。,"The local community is recruited through agnatic kinship, matrilateral kinship and affinality (Gluckman 1982 [1956])."
5969,如果一个男人被卷入一场以效忠于父方家族关系为基础的血仇中，他就会面临不得不冒着将仇恨指向他最亲近的邻居和合作者的风险，因此，许多努尔人都试图尽可能避免与其他家系发生公开的冲突。,"If a man becomes entangled in a blood feud based on agnatic kinship loyalties, he thus runs the risk of having to direct his revenge towards his nearest neighbour and collaborator.Many Nuer therefore try to avoid open conflict with other lineages as far as possible."
5970,印象管理的观念被巴思吸收并应用在对一艘离开西挪威的拖网渔船上的工作人员的社会组织研究上（Barth 1966）。,The notion of impression management has been taken up by Fredrik Barth in his study of the social organisation of the crew of a trawler off western Norway (Barth 1966).
5970,船上有一位船长，5到8个渔民水手，还有一个“渔网指挥（netboss）”。,"The boat has a captain, a crew of five to eight fishermen, and a ""netboss""."
5970,他们所有人都具有多重身份，但在渔船上，他们的职业身份远比其他身份重要得多。,"All of them have a variety of statuses, but in the boat their professional statuses are by far the most important."
5970,不同部门的行动者具有不同的任务，船长的工作是掌舵和监督其他人；“渔网指挥”的任务则是发现渔群和命令渔民下网，当他“觉得”水下有大量的鱼的时候；而渔民的任务是，完成所有的体力活儿。,"Each category of actors has specified tasks.The captain's job is to steer the boat and to supervise the others.The ""netboss"" is expected to find schools of fish and to order the fishermen to drop the net when he ""feels"" that there are large amounts of fish down below.The fishermen, for their part, carry out all the manual work."
5970,以这个简单的身份分配作为研究的起始点，巴思描述了船上的角色扮演。,"With this simple status distribution as his point of departure, Barth describes the role play on the ship."
5971,相反，日后的人类学领域生发于一批富有同情心的激进主义者所关注的事业，这些人同英国社会的一个独特的圈子联系在一起:非英国国教徒，尤其是辉格党的慈善家。,"Instead, the field that was to become anthropology arose out of the concerns of compassionate activists who were linked to a distinctive circle in British society: that of Nonconformists and especially Quaker philanthropists."
5971,下面对英国人类学的出现所进行的讨论尤其倚重于小乔治˙斯托金（George W. Stocking Jr.) 关于皇家人类学协会（Royal Anthropological Institute) (1971)起源的一篇详细而富有洞见的论文。,The following discussion of the emergence of British anthropology leans heavily on a detailed and perceptive article by George W. Stocking Jr. on the origins of the Royal Anthropological Institute (1971).
5971,对于整个时期丰富和详细的论述详见斯托金1987年的著述（Stocking 1987)。,"For a rich and detailed account of the whole period, see Stocking 1987."
5972,在华盛顿，就像在美国其他地方一样，由于大量的、并且越来越多的社会地位低下的“黑人”妇女，婴儿天折已经成为美国黑人的一个主要的健康问题，她们婴儿的死亡率几乎是“白人”婴儿的两倍。,"In Washington, as in the rest of the United States, infant mortality is mainly an African American health problem because of the large and increasing number of disadvantaged Black women; their infants die at almost twice the rate of White infants."
5972,在布恩调査的那所医院里，所住的绝大部分病人都是贫穷的美国黑人。,
5972,,The hospital where Boone worked served an ovethelnningly impoverished and African American population.
5972,在接下来的一年半中，布恩集中翻阅了医疗、出生和死亡记录，做了统计分析，还访问了夭折婴儿的母亲、护士、汽科医生、社会工作者和行政人员。,"For the next year and a half, Boone worked intensively reviewing medical, birth, and death records; doing statistical analyses; and interviewing women whose infants had died, as well as nurses, physicians, social workers, and administrators."
5973,只要产品能找到市场，价格与利润体系就能刺激生产与技术进步。,The price and profit system stimulated production and technological progress as long as the output could find a market.
5973,但和青铜时代的社会——经济系统一样，燃料时代的新型商业主义亦有其国有局限。,"But, like the socio-economic system of the Bronze Age, the new commercialism of the Fuel era had its inherent limitations."
5973,没有一个工业国家曾经有或可能有足够的购买力，以保持和吸收其自己的产品。工业利润体系的真正基础，就在于产品的价值高于按支付给产业工人以工资计算的生产资本。,No industrial nation had or could have purchasing power sufficient to keep and absorb its own output; the very basis of the industrial profit system was an excess in value of product over the cost of production in terms of wages paid to the industrial workers.
5973,因此，剩余物品的出口是必不可少的：“我们必须出口，要么就得完蛋！”这是近年来从不止一个国家听到的绝望的呼声。,"Export of surplus was therefore essential; ""we must export or die"" is a cry of desperation heard from more than one nation in recent years."
5974,当时的许多人类学研究依然以博物馆为基础。博厄斯提升了博物馆的专业化程度并且将他的学生安插到关键位置上，如在美国自然历史博物馆工作的克拉克˙威斯勒（Clark Wissler)。,Much anthropological research at the time was still based in museums; Boas fostered the professionalization of museums and placed his students in key positions (such as Clark Wissler at the AMNH).
5974,博厄斯还积极地创建专业协会，其中包括1902年成立的美国人类学协会（尽管博厄斯直到1907年才当选为主席）。同时，博厄斯还积极创办期刊并确保在国家机构中有人类学的代表。,"Boas was also active in creating professional associations, including the AAA in 1902 (although he did not become its president until 1907); in founding journals; and in ensuring anthropological representation in national organizations."
5974,此外，他还是一个活跃于公共问题如民族主义、种族关系、教育和优生学的评论家。他所参与的这些活动并非出自某种特别的政治目的，而是基于人类学知识应能为解决社会问题指明道路的信念。,"He was, moreover, a frequent commentator on public issues such as nationalism, race relations, education, and eugenics, not as part of a specifically political program but in the conviction that anthropological knowledge would itself point the way to societal solutions."
5975,这类经验其实也就是人类学家尼达姆（Rodney Needham）举例说明“信仰”并不是一个描述多数宗教体验合适的术语时所暗示的。,"This sort of experience is what anthropologist Rodney Needham implies when he demonstrates that ""belief"" is not a suitable term for describing much of religious experience."
5975,实际上，信仰最适合起源于近东有着独特经典和神学传统的宗教——像犹太教、伊斯兰教和基督教。,"Belief, in fact, best suits those peculiarly textual and theological traditions of Near Eastern origin – Judaism, Islam, and Christianity."
5975,信仰就是主张：我相信有上帝；我相信有天堂。,A belief is a proposition: I believe there is a God; I believe there is a heaven.
5975,但是，人类与宗教/魂灵之间的联系要比这更深、更复杂。,The relation of humans to the spiritual is deeper and more complex than this.
5976,有机团结描述的是像我们自己的当代、都市化的社会。,"Organic solidarity characterizes contemporary, urbanized society like our own."
5976,在这里，联系基于劳动分工：屠户用他的肉来换钱，面包师用他的面包来换钱，然后屠户才能用换来的钱去买面包，而面包师也才可能用换来的钱去买肉。,"Here connections are based on division of labor: the butcher exchanges his meat for money, the baker exchanges his bread for money, and with that money the butcher can buy bread and the baker, meat."
5976,每个人都先完成他自己的工作，彼此有益的交换，就是将社会连接到一起的东西。,"Each does his own work, and mutually useful exchange is what holds the society together."
5977,皮亚罗亚人不仅仅对幽灵和神明的存在，而且对这些事物的影响能力，表现出他们的深信不疑。,"The Piaroa express their strong conviction, not only in the existence of spirits and gods, but also in the efficacy of these beings."
5977,讲述者的目的是，通过“神话诗学”展示宇宙观方面的知识和历史初创时期的宇宙事件，以此来治愈病人并阻止病患，同时也滋养人们以及周围的土地、森林。,"The chanter’s intention is, through ‘mythopoetics’, to display knowledge of cosmology, of the cosmogonic events of creation-time history, and in so doing to cure illness and prevent it—and also to generate the fertility of people and the land and forest around them."
5977,所以神话的讲述者掌握了深奥的存在论的素材，具备相当的能力来加以处理（Overing 1990；1995）。,"The chanter of myths therefore demonstrates a deep knowledge of ontological matters, and also considerable power in dealing with them (Overing 1990, 1995)."
5978,历史语言学家已成功地描述了当语言从比较古老的母体语言中分离时所发生的各种变化。,Historical linguists have successfully described the changes that have occurred as languages have diverged from more ancient parent languages.
5978,他们还根据语言的相似与差异，形成了一些方法，以估计某些人口迁徙、入侵、接触发生的时间。,"They also have developed means of estimating when certain migrations, invasions, and contacts of peoples have taken place, on the basis of linguistic similarities and differences."
5978,例如，语言趋异概念就是用来推测操一门语言的一个群体从另一个群体中分离出来的时间。,"The concept of linguistic divergence, for example, is used to guess when one group of speakers of a language separated from another group."
5978,有一种比较复杂的技术，被称为词源统计分析法（glottochronology），它是由莫里斯·斯沃德什和萨拉·古德西斯基在20世纪50年代早期提出来的，他们试图推测诸如拉丁语和希腊语一类的相关语言从一种较早的共同语言中分离出来的时期。,"A more complicated technique, known as glottochronology, was developed by Swadesh and Lees in the early 1950s to try to date the divergence of related languages, such as Latin and Greek, from an earlier common language."
5979,归根到底，语言使人类能够保留其文化并使它代代相传。,"Ultimately, language is what allows people to preserve and transmit their culture from generation to generation."
5979,研究人类语言的文化人类学分支学科被称为语言人类学（Linguistic Anthropology）。,The branch of cultural anthropology that studies human languages is called linguistic anthropology.
5979,语言学家可能从事于语言描述（句子形成或动词词形变化的方式）或者语言历史（随时间推移语言的发展和相互变化的情况）的研究。,Linguists may deal with the description of a language (the way a sentence is formed or a verb conjugated) or with the history of languages (the way languages develop and influence each other with the passage of rime).
5979,两种研究方式都产生有价值的信息，不仅有关于人类如何交流的信息，而且也有关于他们如何理解周围世界的信息。,"Both approaches yield valuable information, not only about the ways people communicate but also about the ways they understand the world around them."
5980,当个体的选择受到语法约束(此时共同使用者仅可理解部分代码）和社会约束（此时仅有部分代码被认为是真实可信的）时，在语言社区内部也依然存在很多可能的可被接受的形式，每一形式之间都有细微差别。,"While an individuals choice is subject to grammatical restraints (whereby only some codifications are intelligible to fellow users) and social restraints (whereby only some codifications are considered pukka), still there will likely be a range of possible, acceptable formulations within a speech-community, each with a subtly different effect."
5980,这样一来，个体从指令系统中的选择就取决于从器械库中选择何种武器了（Gumperz 1970)。,Thus the individual's selection from the repertoire is akin to a choice of weapon from an arsenal (Gumperz 1970).
5980,这很重要，而且不要低估个体说者和听者的能力，他们能在不同指令系统之间、不同语法之间以及不同言语社区之间进行策略性发掘，创造出新的事物，或是促使某些天生的发音差异被夸奖、夸大或忽略（Hymes 1979)。,"It is important, moreover, not to underestimate the extent to which individual speaker—hearers can strategically deploy their competencies, switching between repertoires, grammars and speech communities, creating anew, and having their innate differences of voice socially celebrated, exaggerated or ignored (Hymes 1979)."
5981,为了“清除”之前的个人身份，这种艰难而危险的阈限却是必 要的，这可以使得他或她做好准备重生为新类型的社会人。,"This difficult and dangerous liminality is nevertheless necessary in order to ""clean off"" the earlier statuses of the individual, to make him or her ready to be reborn as a new category of social person."
5981,在研究坦桑尼亚的一支母系民族卡古鲁人的时候，贝德尔曼 (T.O. Beidelman 1971)写道，如果一个男孩在割礼之后立即死去，他不会被按照常规的方式下葬，因为他死的时候既不是孩子，又不是成人，而是一个边缘的、中间类型的人，甚至不是人。,"In a study of the Kaguru, a matrilineal people in Tanzania, T.O. Beidelman (1971) writes that if a boy dies immediately after circumcision he cannot be buried in the ordinary way, since he will have died neither as a child nor as an adult, but as a liminal, indeterminate kind of person, or even non-person."
5981,过渡仪式的最后一个阶段是融合，在这个阶段，候选人返回成为新的人，通常比原来等级更高。,"The final phase in rites of passage is reintegration.During this phase, the candidates return as new persons, usually at a higher level of rank."
5981,贝德尔曼对卡古鲁人的启蒙仪式进行了详细的描述，在其中很容易就能确认特纳所说的那三个阶段。,"Beidelman provides detailed descriptions of initiation rites among the Kaguru, and it is easy to identify the three phases analysed by Turner in these."
5981,仪式中必定包含了对两种性别的道德教育和身体改造，但它们的内容不尽相同。,"The rites entail both moral education and physical alterations for both genders, but their content differs."
5982,无论卡特林还是歌德，都没有孜孜以求地去描述他们所观察的仪式的参加者的经验。,Neither Catlin nor Goethe make any sustained effort to describe the experience for the participants of the ceremonies they observed.
5982,卡特林只是修辞性地采取了曼丹人的视角。,Catlin assumes the perspective of the Mandan only rhetorically.
5982,对他而言，欧吉帕是一件“耸人听闻的事”[“仪式的这一部分（折磨)依然历历在目，真是让人不忍卒睹，当他们读到它的时候甚至会叫人对这世界产生怀疑（1857:157)]，他徒劳地努力陚予它意义，他没法在仪式中找到熟悉的故事，好让它不那么支离破碎。,"For him, the O-Kee-Pa was a ""shocker"" (""This part o f the ceremony [the torture], as I have just witnessed it, is truly shocking to behold, and will stagger the belief of the world when they read of it"" [ 1857 : 157 ] ) ; and he struggled unsuccessfully to give it meaning.He could find no familiar story in which to fit it in more than a fragmented way."
5982,罗马狂欢节对于歌德变成了一则个人命运的寓言。,T h e Roman carnival became for Goethe an allegory o f individual destiny.
5982,它当然没那么陌生。,It was o f course not that unfamiliar.
5983,最初在殖民主义时期被人类学家研究过的那些民族现在怎么样了？,What has become of the peoples first explored by anthropologists during colonialism?
5983,几乎他们所有人，在不同的程度上，都被整合到了更大的一最终是全球化的——经济、文化和政治系统中。,"Nearly all of them are, to varying degrees, integrated into larger – in the final instance global – economic, cultural and political systems."
5983,对于某些民族来说，例如巴布亚新几内亚的赞巴加的马林人（Tsembaga Maring），这种整合在他们的日常生活中仍然是相对不重要的。,"To some, such as the Tsembaga Maring of Papua New Guinea, this integration is still of relatively minor importance in their everyday life."
5983,虽然为工资工作和货币经济已经进入了他们的社会，他们仍然靠养猪和园艺农业维持生计。,"Although wagework and a monetary economy have entered their society, they still get their livelihood from pig-raising and horticulture."
5983,因为国家垄断暴力的有效性日益增强，在高原上作战却变得困难了。,"Because of the increasingly efficient state monopoly of violence, it has nevertheless become difficult to go to war in the highlands."
5984,此类原初心理过程所具有的一个共同特点是，它不可避免地要发展变化。,"One characteristic of such a primary process is that it has a seeming ""inevitabilty"" of development."
5984,众所周知，大多数文化过程都是一些业已确立的原则和规范的结果，然而无论这些规则是单一的、合并还是相互冲突的，它们都不能支配原初心理过程。,"It should not be envisaged, as most cultural processes may be, as the product of established principles and norms, whether taken singly, conjointly, or in conflict."
5984,原初心理过程来自人类深层次的需要，人们的内心深处都渴望着更直接和更平等的交往关系，而这些愿望却又受到社会规范的阻碍和扭曲。,"Rather it arises from deep human needs for more direct and egalitarian ways of knowing and experiencing relationships, needs which have been frustrated or perverted by those secondary processes which constitute the homeostatic functioning of institutionalized social structure."
5984,社会规范作为制度化结构保持稳定的手段总是试图运用伦理的和法律的制裁来约束原初心理过程过于极端的方面，所以原初心理过程总是很迫切地要扫除任何对自己加以约束的个人和群体。,
5985,最早的毫无疑义的原人（ hominines）（人，也就是说，近似的人）以追溯到560万年前到580万年前东非的化石为代表。,"The first undoubted hominines (humans or, in this case, near humans) are represented by fossils from East Africa that go back 5.6 million to 5.8 million years."
5985,所有化石都是极小的碎片，尽管一个个 体的大约45%的碎片是从埃塞俄比亚的一个遗址中见到的。,"All are extremely fragmentary, although about 45% of one individual is known from a site in Ethiopia."
5985,它通常被称为阿迪皮特卡斯，有440万年之久。,"Known as Ardipithecus, it is 4.4 million years old."
5985,虽然它比现代黑猩猩要小得多，但在其特征上，它比任何其他原人都史像黑猩猩。,"Though much smaller than a modern chimpanzee, it is more chimpanzee-like in its features than any other hominine."
5985,但是与黑猩猩不同，而是像所有其他原人，它完全以人的方式行走，这就是说，用两足行走。,"But unlike chimpanzees, and like all other hominines, it walked in a fully human manner, that is, bipedally."
5986,我认为原生论为族裔情感（ethnic sentiment)的力量做了很好的描述，我们还可以运用社会学和历史学等方面的客观文献更好地解释族裔差异。,"So far I have suggested that primordialism provides a good description of the power of ethnic sentiment, but that we can better explain ethnic differences through objective historical and sociological data."
5986,然而，我不想忽略主观因素在族裔意识产生和存在过程中所发挥的作用。,"However, I do not want to neglect the subjective elements in the making and sustaining of ethnic consciousness."
5986,现在应该转到我前面提到的观念问题上。,"It is time now to turn to the question of perception, which I flagged earlier."
5987,由原始生态智慧讨论所引发的问题，无论对环境话语，还是对人类学在话语中的参与，都是至关重要的。,This discussion raises questions which are of central importance both to environmental discourse and to anthropology'sparticipation in that discourse.
5987,非工业社会中的民族能够与其环境和谐共处的说法在多大程度上是真实的？,To what extent is the impression that non-industrial peoples live in harmony with the environment an accurate one?
5987,生态系统民族被认为具有更强的环境责任意识，那么在现寒中他们是否履行了自身的责任？,Are the expectations that ecosystem peoples have a greater sense of responsibility towards their environments fulfilled in reality?
5987,他们是否真的拥有一种“原始生态智慧”？,"Do they really possess a kind of ""primitive ecological wisdom""?"
5987,非工业社会民族能够与环境和谐共处的看法在环境决定论思想中已经确立起来，取得了全球环境话语的广泛共识，尤其是受到了非工业民族自身的赞同。,"14 The image of non-industrial communities living inharmony with the environment is well established in environmentalist thought and widely accepted in global environmental discourse, not least by non-industrial peoples themselves."
5987,但事实上，我认为这种认识犹如一个“神话”。我之所以这么说，并不是要完全否定它的真实性，也不是说它包含某种特殊的、“象征性的”真理，而是说它已 经被看作是一种无需证明也难以驳倒的教条和定论（Robinson 1968，Milton 1977)。,"Indeed, I think it reasonable to suggest that this image has the status of a ""myth"", by which I mean, not that it is necessarily untrue, nor that it has some special, ""symbolic"" truth, but that its truth is treated as a dogma (Robinson 1968, Milton 1977), in no need of proof and not easily amenable to refutation."
5988,进化论的英国人类学家阅读广泛，并且与源流相近的德国、美国和法国学者交流思想。,"Evolutionist British anthropologists read widely and exchanged ideas with cognate German, American, and French scholars."
5988,他们的讨论和意见分歧非常尖锐——或许确切地说是因为他们的解释性观点太过软弱无力，以致经常导致他们得出完全不同的说法。,Their discussions and disagreements were remarkably acrimonious—perhaps precisely because their explanatory ideas were so flimsy and so often led them to construct entirely different accounts.
5988,泰勒在他们当中的领导地位虽部分得自他在学术上的深刻洞见，但在相当的程度上也是因为他超乎一般的通情达理和礼貌谦逊的气质。,Tylor's leading position among them may have been won by his exceptional reasonableness and decorum as much as it arose from the profundity of his scholarship.
5988,虽然如此，他的《原始文化》被认为质量极高，使他被选为皇家学会的成员，并且在1896年得到了牛津的教授之职，之后更在1912年获封骑士称号。,"His Primitive Culture, nonetheless, was judged of a quality to lead to his election as a fellow of the Royal Society and in due course to a professorship at Oxford in 1896 and to knighthood in 1912."
5989,因此，民族志学家要花费漫长时期与他们所研究的人们生活在一起，分享他们的欢乐，经历他们的艰辛，包括疾病，偶尔还有过早天折。,"Thus, ethnographers spend prolonged periods living with the people they study, sharing their joys and suffering their deprivations, including sickness and, sometimes, premature death."
5989,他们不会那么幼稚地相信，他们能够、甚或应当对他们与之分享考验和痛苦的人们无动于衷。,"They are not so naive as to believe they can be, or even should be, dispassionate about the people whose trials and tribulations they share."
5989,就如罗宾˙福克斯说的:“我们的心和脑应理解我们男人和女人讲的话。,"As Robin Fox puts it, ""our hearts, as well as our brains, should be with our men and women""."
5989,人类学家不会自欺欺人地相信，他们能对他们的发现所带来的道德和政治后果避而不谈。,Nor are anthropologists so self-deceived as to believe they can avoid dealing with the moral and political consequences of their findings.
5989,的确，人类学有保护和促进当地民族权利的悠久传统，在本书后面的章节，我们将回到这一主题。,"Indeed, anthropology has a long tradition of advocacy for the rights of indigenous peoples, a topic we shall return to in later chapters of this textbook."
5990,由于身份有差别以及对制裁的常规执行，社会生活具有一定程度的规律性和可预测性。,"Thanks to status differentiation and the regular implementation of sanctions, social life has a certain degree of regularity and predictability."
5990,不过，这种可预测性远非对全部社会生活的预测，如果是这样，社会科学家将会变成杰出的先知。,"However, this predictability is far from total.If it were, social scientists would be outstanding prophets."
5990,社会身份及其对应的动态的角色提供社会期望和可能的制裁，通过给予相关的特定权利和义务，身份和角色为行动者可能的行动范围画出了轮廓。,"The social status and its dynamic counterpart, the role, delineate some of the possible scope for the actor, by giving him or her certain rights and duties connected to expectations and possible sanctions."
5990,但是，一个人的社会身份永远不能定义他或她的行动的全部领域。,"However, the social status of a person never defines his or her entire field of agency."
5990,这部分地归因于一种身份很少会被精确地限定、详细地规定在每个情境中应该怎么做的事实，以及角色从来都不会与身份完全一致的事实，也就是说，你被迫为你的角色进行即席表演。,"This is partly due to the fact that a status rarely entails exact, detailed rules concerning how to behave in every situation, and also to the fact that the role is never identical with the status."
5990,比如说，尽管“父亲”这个身份的社会定义包含有一些详细的特定期望，每个社会却有着非常不同的扮演父亲的方式。,"One is, in other words, forced to improvise – for example, there are many, widely different ways of enacting the father role in every society, although the social definition of the status ""father"" also entails certain expectations."
5990,行动者（演员）不得不在行动（演出）之前理解一下角色，从这个意思上说，每一个身份又都是暧昧不清的。,"Every status, however, is ambiguous in the sense that actors have to interpret it before enacting it."
5991,这就意味着那些被社会定义为越轨者的人事实上只是遭受到任意隔离的被迫害的个体。,This meant that those whom society defined as deviants were in reality persecuted individuals suffering arbitrary exclusion.
5991,但这里似乎也提到任何社会都有一种不变的需求，它们要运用越轨作为一种手段来定义可接受的规则并给自身提供一道边界和一种认同。,But there also seems to be a reference here to any society's invariable need to use deviance as a way of defining acceptable norms and providing itself with both a boundary and an identity.
5991,考虑到他对社会控制的消极态度，福柯所提供的前景最终只能是绝望的。,"Given his negative attitude toward social control, Foucault's vision could ultimately only be one of despair."
5991,虽然福柯隐晦地预言了科学的终结，认为它与法律一起已经成为现代社会主要的制造规训的工具，但是他似乎又相信，只要人类是社会性的，他们就总是会受制于这种或那种规训控制的恣意统治。,"Although obscurely predicting the end of science, which had become, with law, the chief instrument producing discipline in modern society, he also appears to have believed that as long as humans were social, they would always be subjected to arbitrary regimes of disciplinary control of one sort or the other."
5992,礼物在被定义的同时就是具有社会整合功能的，并且能再次确认个体之间的特定关系。,Gifts are socially integrating at the same time as they define and reconfirm specified relationships between individuals.
5992,而资本主义系统中的商品交换以一种不同的方式运作。,Commodity exchange in a capitalist system works in a different way.
5992,当你在超市买食品的时候，非常可能的是，过后你会想不起收银员的脸。,"When buying food at the supermarket, it is exceedingly likely that one will not remember the face of the cashier later."
5992,在一个旨在解释历史转变为资本主义的重要研究中，卡尔·波拉尼（Karl Polanyi 1957[1944]；也可参见 Godelier 1991）区分了物质产品流通中三种不同的原则，或不同的分配形式：互惠、再分配和市场交换。,"In an important study which aimed to explain the historical transition to capitalism, Karl Polanyi (1957 [1944]; see also Godelier 1991) distinguishes between three different principles in the circulation of material goods, or forms of distribution: reciprocity, redistribution and market exchange."
5992,互惠是礼物经济分配的主导原则，例如在美拉尼西亚之类的那些以平等主义为基础的社会中，它们的社区在很大程度上是通过互惠原则、通过由给予礼物所创造的相互义务关系而被整合起来的。,Reciprocity is the dominant principle of distribution in gift economies such as those found in the egalitarian societies of Melanesia.Such communities are to a great extent integrated through the principle of reciprocity; through those mutual obligations created by gift-giving.
5993,一种特定的疾病是否由纳瓦霍人的巫技引起的，由占卜（divination）来决定，占卜是一种能够揭示女巫身份的巫术程序。,"Whether or not a particular illness results from Navajo witchcraft is determined by divination, a magical procedure that also reveals the witch's identity."
5993,一旦某个人被指控使用了巫技，他或她就会受到公众的质询——在过去，他或她甚至还可能被折磨到坦白为止。,"Once a person is charged with witchcraft, he or she is publicly interrogated, possibly even tortured, until there is a confession."
5993,人们相信，一旦一个女巫承认自己的罪过，她自己的咒语便会转向她自身，因此人们指望她将在一年之内死去。,"It is believed the witch's own curse will turn against the witch once this happens, so it is expected the witch will die within a year."
5993,有些认罪的女巫因此被允许活下来，但得流放。,Some confessed witches have been allowed to live in exile.
5993,根据克莱德˙克拉克洪的观点，纳瓦霍人的巫技所起的作用是疏导由美国白人的压力所造成的焦虑、紧张和挫败感。,"According to Clyde Kluckhohn, Navajo witchcraft served to channel anxieties, tensions, and frustrations caused by the pressures from Anglo Americans."
5994,尽管家庭也许很适合承担这些任务，但我们不应该认为它是能够提供这些条件的唯一的、甚至是最好的单位。,"Well suited though the family may be for these tasks, we should not suppose it is the only unit capable of providing such conditions."
5994,"事实上，其他同样有效的安排也是可能的，比如说以色列的基布兹,在那里，成对的男性和女性组成的专职人员抚养成群的孩子。","In fact, other arrangements are possible, such as the Israeli kibbutz, where paired teams of male and female specialists raise groups of children."
5994,在很多寻食社会（第五章和第六章讨论过的朱瓦西人和姆布蒂人就是很好的例子），社区中所有的成年成员都共同分担照顾孩子的责任。,"In many food-foraging societies (the Juoansi and Mbuti, discussed in Chapters 5 and 6, are good examples), all adult members of a community share in the responsibilities of child care."
5994,"因此，当父母出去狩猎或者采集植物和调味草的时候，他们就可以把他们的孩子放心地留在象里,确信他们会得到任何留在营地的成年人的照看。","Thus, when parents go off to hunt or to collect plants and herbs, they may leave their children behind, secure in the knowledge they will be looked after by whatever adults remain in the camp."
5995,根据定义，“无家可归者”者是“间生物”（hybrid），也就是说，他们不再是“确定的”了。,"By definition, ‘unhomely’ peoples are ‘hybrids’, that is, people who are no longer authentic."
5995,为了保持确定性和可鉴赏性，绝对的真实性观念——即使被用来作为非常积极的结果——曾经导致了他者被冻结于一个无法摆脱的虚构的过去。,"The very idea of authenticity—even when thought to be used for very positive ends—had the consequence of freezing other peoples into a mythic past, where to remain authentic and thus appreciated they could not leave."
5995,指导非常晚近的时期，人类学中才出现了非常一个强大的规则，一个真正的人类学家不应研究那些被玷污了的、穿着西方服饰——男人穿裤子、女人穿裙子——的人；而应该研究那些缠着树皮腰带或穿着自制棉布的人。,"Until very recently there has been a strong code in anthropology that a real anthropologist did not study people who were so tainted as to wear Western clothes—men in trousers, women in skirts, rather than loincloths of beaten bark or selfspun cotton."
5996,直到最近，妇女还在使用兵器方面得到训练。,"In modern guerilla uprisings, women frequently fight."
5996,显然，根据性别的分工无法简单地解释为性别差异的结果，无论它们是男性的力量和能耗，还是女性的生殖的生活规律和现象。,"Clearly, the sexual division of labor cannot be explained simply as a consequence of male strength, expendabilicy, or female reproductive biology."
5996,为了看到根据性别的分工是怎样与其他文化和历史的因素相关的，不是去寻找生物学规则来解释它，更富有成效的策略是考察在具体社会环境中男子和妇女所做工作的种类。,"Instead of looking for biological imperatives to explain the sexual division of labor, a more productive strategy is to examine the kinds of work men and women do in the context of specific societies to see how the work relates to other cultural and historical factors."
5996,研究者发现三种形态，其一，以灵活性和男女相协调为特点，其二，根据性别严格分开，其三，以其他两种的各要素为特点。,"Researchers find three configurarions, one featuring flexibility and sexual integration, another involving rigid segregation by sex, and a third combining dements of the other two."
5997,对实现世界政治统一的抵制力量，在某种程度上似乎被跨国公司的兴起抵消了。,"The world's resistance to political integration seems to be offset, at least partially, by the rise of multinational corporations."
5997,因为这些公司跨越了国界，它们是推进全球整合的力量，尽管有各种政治差异把人们分开。,"Because these cur across the boundaries berween states, they are a force for global unity despite the political differences that divide people."
5997,人类学家非常熟悉这种情形，就像下面这段对祖尼印第安人整合机制的描述那样：四五个不同层面的系统相互交织，因而维持了整个社会的统一性，如果这些不同层面相互整合的话，这种统一性很快就会消失，因而很有可能带来隔离和分裂宗族、兄弟互助会、祭司群体、地下大会堂，在某种意义上还有赌博团伙，都是分化机构。,"Situations such as this are well known to anthropologists, as illustrated by this description of Zuni Indian integrative mechanisms: segregation and fission.The clans, the fraternities, the priesthoods, the kivas, in a measure the gaming parties, are ail dividing agencies."
5997,如果它们相互一致的话，社会结构的裂缝就会很深；通过彼此相互交织，它们制造出各种分支，这些分支造成了一种几乎不可思议的复杂性，但却绝不会导致这个民族实体的分裂。,"If they coincided, the rifts in the social structure would be deep; by countering each other they cause segmentations which produce an almost marvelous complexity, but can never break apart the national entity."
5998,整体论是一个十分重要并且必要但却也是不可能完全实现的美好理想。,Holism is an important but impossible ideal.
5998,你不可能注意到所有地方或是考虑到所有事情。,You cannot see everywhere or think everything.
5998,你必须进行选择，找出重点关注所在。,You must select and emphasize.
5998,为了做到这一点，你必须进行分类和作出区分。,"To do this, you must categorize and make distinctions."
5998,只有这样你才能对事物进行分析，获得理解。,Only in this way can you analyze and understand.
5999,唤起——也就是说，“民族志”——是后现代世界的话语，因为制造科学并由科学制造的世界已经失落，科学思想现在只是意识的一个陈旧模式，如果没有民族志语境来创造和维持它，它就只能幸存一阵子，还是以衰退的形式而幸存。,"Evocation—that is to say, ""ethnography""—is the discourse of the post - modern world, for the world that made science, and that science made, has disappeared, and scientific thought is now an archaic mode of consciousness surviving for a while yet in degraded form without the ethnographic context that created and sustained it."
5999,科学思想的衰微乃是因其违背了文化的第一法则，即，“人所控制之物越多，人和物就越变得无法控制。,"Scientific thought succumbed because it violated the first law of culture, which says that ""the more man controls anything, the more uncontrollable both become."""
5999,”在其神话的总体化修辞中，科学声称它是自身正当存在之理由，并寻求控制其话语，使之获得自主地位。,"In the totalizing rhetoric of its mythology, science purported to be its own justification and sought to control and autonomize its discourse."
6000,这里并不是要证明林哈特的欺骗性；尽管他的书对性别的限定到了不同寻常的程度。,The point is not to convict Lienhardt of duplicity; his book specifies gender to an unusual extent.
6000,真正浮现的，是干预了我们的阅读的历史和政治议题。,"What emerges, instead, are the history and politics that intervene in our reading."
6000,属于一个特定时代和特定社会集团的英国学术界，比其他的社会团体更爱用“men”一词表示“人”（people）的意思，这个文化和历史语境现在不像过去那样隐于无形了。,"British academics of a certain caste and era say ""men"" when they mean ""people"" more often than do other groups, a cultural and historical context that is now less invisible than it once was."
6000,我们现在在这里讨论的性别偏见在林哈特的书出版的1961年还不成问题。,The partiality of gender in question here was not at issue when the book was published in 1961.
6000,如果有问题的话，林哈特就已经直接提出这个问题了，就像更近一代的民族志学者现在感到有这个责任-样[例如梅格斯（Meigs 1984:xix)]。,"I fit were, Lienhardt would have directly addressed the problem, as more recent ethnographers now feel obliged to (for example, Meigs 1984: xix )."
6000,那个时候人们读“丁卡人的宗教”不像现在现在人们必定读成丁卡男人的宗教，只是或许也可能是丁卡女人的宗教。,"One did not read "" The Religion of the Dinka"" then as one now must, as the religion of Dinka men and only perhaps Dinka women."
6000,我们的任务就是历史地思考林哈特的文本和它可能的阅读，包括我们自己对它的阅读。,"Our task is to think historically about Lienhardt's text and its possible readings, including our own, as we read."
6001,利佐的主要作品是关于雅诺玛米（Yanomami)人的，他们或许是南美洲被研究得最多的人群。,"Lizot's major work has been on the Yanomami, perhaps the most studied people in South America."
6001,美国的人类学家拿破仑˙夏格农 (Napoleon Chagonn) —直关注于勾勒出雅诺玛米文化和社会组织的结构原则，而利佐却更纯粹地专注于描述，就和贝尔诺和乔治˙孔多米纳所做的一样，在最大程度上避免作理论推断。,"While the American anthropologist Napoleon Chagnon has always been heavily concerned with delineating the structural principles of Yanomami culture and social organization, Lizot is more purely descriptive, for the most part eschewing theoretical extrapolations as much as Bernot and Georges Condominas did."
6001,不过，利佐还是强调了雅诺玛米人政治体系的缺陷，而这种缺陷既是由令雅诺玛米人远近闻名的暴力所引起的，反过来又导致了这种暴力的发生。,"Nonetheless he stresses the weakness of the political system, which both is caused by and causes the violence that theYanomami have become so famous for, and which he attributes largely to illicit sexual relations."
6002,民族认同的第二个维度与政治团体对自身的假想方式有关。,The second dimension of national identity has to do with the way a political community imagines itself.
6002,政治团体是高度复杂的实体，成千上万的成员从未见过面，但为了这些从未见过面的人，他或她需要交税、作出牺牲，甚至付出生命。,"Political communities are highly complex entities, involving millions of people the individual member has never seen, but for whom he or she is expected to pay taxes, make sacrifices, and even die."
6002,政治团体还包括不计其数的过去和将来的世世代代，通过共同的利益和纽带与团体的每一个成员发生联系。,"They also encompass countless past and future generations, to whom each member is bound, again by common interests and attachments."
6003,这两个相反的例子揭示了有关政治一体化水平的一个重要差异。,These two contrasting examples reveal an important difference regarding the level of political integration.
6003,美拉尼西亚系统是以亲属制度为基础的平等主义，其特征是平等和成就。,"The Melanesian system is kinship-based, egalitarian and characterised by equality and achievement."
6003,而波利尼西亚系统则相反，它是世袭的，并且以归属身份为基础，建立在贵族和平民的差异之上。,"The Polynesian system, by contrast, is hierarchical and ascription-based, founded on differences between the aristocracy and commoners."
6003,当平等原则没有被充分考虑的时候，美拉尼西亚系统会崩溃，而当制度化的等级系统不再是合法的，波利尼西亚的秩序也会垮掉。,"The Melanesian system collapses when the principle of equality is not taken care of sufficiently, while the Polynesian order folds when the institutionalised hierarchy is no longer legitimate."
6003,一个重要的差异涉及各自的社会类型在累积剩余产品方面的能力。,An important difference concerns the ability of the respective societal types to accumulate surplus.
6003,美拉尼西亚社会所实行的临时性农业（swidden agriculture）使得非常不容易生产出比维持生存所需要的更大量的产品，而波利尼西亚的火山群岛发展出的灌溉技术使其有可能供养一个由专业军人和官僚组成的阶级。,"The swidden agriculture practised in Melanesian societies did not make it easy to produce much more than the requirements for subsistence, while irrigation technology developed in the volcanic Polynesian islands made it possible to support a class of full-time soldiers and bureaucrats."
6004,因为田野工作需要田野工作者与知情人之间的信任关系，人类学家首先显然要对他或她的知情人和他们的人民负责。,"Because fieldwork requires a relationship of trust between fieldworker and informants, the anthropologist's first responsibility clearly is to his or her informants and their people."
6004,必须做任何可能的事情以保护他们物质的、社会的福利和心理的健康，尊重他们的尊严和隐私。,"Everything possible must be done to protect their physical, social, and psychological welfare and to honor their dignity and privacy."
6004,换言之，使他们毫无损害。,"In other words, do no harm."
6004,虽然早期人类学家经常为殖民地的行政官员提供“控制”原住民所必要的信息，但是他们很久以前已不再从事这类工作，他们视为首要的事情是人们对其自己文化的权利。,"Although early ethnographers often provided the kind of information colonial administrators needed to control the ""natives"", they long since have ceased to be comfortable with such work and regard as basic a peopled right to their own culture."
6005,分类，从人类学的意义上说，意味着根据社会上已经确定的范围和类型区分物体、人、动物和其他现象。,"Classification, in the anthropological sense, entails dividing objects, people, animals and other phenomena according to socially pre-established categories or types."
6005,在任何社会，这都是知识体系的一个重要组成部分，而知识总是与社会组织和权力有关。,"This is an important part of the knowledge system of any society, and knowledge is always related to social organisation and power."
6005,之前刚刚出现的论点正好反击了认为有些种类的知识是“客观的而且是普遍正确的”的观念，而为了探究知识体系，有必要意识到知识和社会世界的其他部分之间的相互关系，包括你自己的知识。,"Arguments have just been presented against the notion that some kinds of knowledge are ""objectively and universally true"", and in exploring systems of knowledge it is necessary to be aware of the interrelationship between knowledge and other parts of the social world; this includes one's own knowledge."
6005,正如对于有民族优越感的观察者来说，巫术信仰可能是“无理性的”，对于那些认为西方体系是理所当然的人来说，异邦的分类系统可能也是无规律的。,"Just as witchcraft beliefs may seem ""irrational"" to the ethnocentric observer, alien systems of classification may seem unsystematic to someone who takes the Western system for granted."
6005,民族志的研究已经揭示，其他民族的分类方式是多种多样的。,Ethnographic studies have revealed great variations in the ways other people classify.
6006,第一章的讨论表明，许多人类学家还在另一方面反对道格拉斯的理论模式。,"As the discussion in Chapter 1 indicated, many anthropologists would also dissent from Douglas' model in another way."
6006,对道格拉斯来说，社会组织是社会力量的首要产物，其次才是文化视角。,"For Douglas, social organization was primary and cultural perspectives the secondary products of social forces."
6006,许多人类学家都会把社会与文化之间的关系视为一种辩证关系。,Many anthropologists would see the relationship between the cultural and the social as a dialectic.
6006,人们如何认识、思考、感觉形成了他们社会活动的基础，这些活动则产生维持与校正他们文化视角的经验。,"What people know, think and feel forms a basis for their social activities, and these activities generate experiences which both sustain and modify their cultural perspectives."
6006,我一直把这种过程看作是发展一种适合于探讨人类学研究环境话语的文化模式的起点。,I have taken this formula as the starting point for developing a model of culture appropriate for exploring anthropology's contribution to environmental discourse.
6006,但是，在第二章里，我建议不要遵循这个过程。,"But, in Chapter 2, I suggested a departure from it."
6006,因为文化不只与人们的社会活动相关，此文化也不仅仅是由人们与他人的相互交往中所习得的知识构成。,"I argued that culture does not relate only to people's social activities and does not, therefore, consist only of what they learn through their interaction with others."
6006,相反，文化通过我们赖以理解世界的所有意义构成，无论是与他人交流所获取的意义，还是我们自己积极认识周围环境（在“直接感知”的过程中）所获取的意义。,"Instead, it consists of all the meanings through which we understand the world, whether they are communicated to us by others or discovered through our active engagement with our surroundings (in the process referred to as ""direct perception"")."
6006,在我看来，由于我们从社会情景之外获得一部分文化，因此把我们对现实的理解当作是“社会建构的”几乎没有什么意义。,"It is partly because we acquire some of our culture outside social contexts that it makes little sense, in my view, to regard our understanding of reality as being ""socially constructed""."
6007,我们依然不知道是哪一夜。,Again we have no idea which evening.
6007,更有另外几次，在对一件事进行概括化的、时间的和空间的情景化描述时，他突然来一句“正当此时”，一个“inzwischen”不知所谓者何。,"And at still other times, in the midst of a generalized, spatially and temporally decontextualized description of an event, he will suddenly make use of a ""meanwhile,"" an inzwischen, that has no coordinates."
6007,正如我说过的，这些直示词的作用纯粹是修辞，好给他的描述增加些生气，让它们显得更为可信。,"As I have said, the function of these deictics is purely rhetorical, to add life to his descriptions and make them more convincing."
6007,它们证明了歌德的在场，并邀约读者“加入”他的行列。,"They attest to Goethe's presence, and they appeal to the reader to ""join"" him."
6007,歌德的直示词，也许是所有的直示词，都有作为命名（appellative) 的一面。,"There is an appellative dimension to Goethe's deictics, perhaps to all deictics."
6007,他把读者带进了一个似乎颇为真实的观察场景之中，这其实只是他文本里的一个小花招而已。,He draws his readers into a seemingly real moment of observation that is in fact only an artifice of his text.
6007,一边是读者们见证着科索发生的种种事件中逗人心痒的混乱场面，一边是歌德向他们保证，他绝对在场。,He offers them the security of his presence as they witness the tantalizing disorder of the events that take place in the Corso.
6008,格尔茨认为，困境既存在于道德方面，也有认识论方面的因素。,"The nature of the difficulty is both moral and epistemological, Geertz continues."
6008,道德上的困境涉及“去那里”的逻辑，这一逻辑曾经主要是基于殖民主义的背景，如今则以权力的不对称为基础而重现；人类学家依然未经请求的扮演成那些拥有较少西方“资源”的群体的终身代言人和专家，虽然他们只是短暂地在“外围环境”中遭遇对方。,"The moral difficulty concerns logistics of ‘going there’ which were laid largely in the context of colonialism, but whose powerasymmetries can be seen to be replicated today; still anthropologists act as unrequested, lifelong spokespersons-cum-experts for groups of people with fewer Western ‘resources’, whom they briefly meet in some‘peripheral’ environment."
6008,即便很多人类学家如今希望自视为参与者，但是在道德政治关系的重组过程中依旧未能摆脱这种殖民主义的陷阱。,"And yet, such colonialist trappings are a far remove from the reorganization of ethnic political relations in which many anthropologists would nowadays hope to see themselves involved."
6009,"古德曼承认（Gooddman 1978:17-20),上文只是制造世界的方式的一些例子，而不是全部。","The above represents a sample of ways of world-making, not an exhaustive set, Goodman admits (1978:17–20)."
6009,新的方式总是在不断产生，既然新的方式可以通过组合和分层产生，变化就可以从不止一个过程中同时产生。,"New ways are always being created, and since these can also occur in combination and in layers, change can also issue from more than one process at the same time."
6009,另外，新的世界还可能由不同的象征形式来构成：言语、数字、图画、声音、气味，或者这些象征符号的组合；从一种象征符号向另一种的转译也等于创造了一个新的世界。,"Moreover, worlds can be made up from different kinds of symbolic forms: words, numerals, pictures, sounds, smells, or any combination of these; and the translation of one kind of symbolic notation into another is also tantamount to the creation of a new world."
6010,跳出这些历史传统之外考虑人类体验的所有方面，我们发现，整体视角经常发生。,"Going beyond these historic traditions and considering the gamut of human experience, we discover that the holistic view occurs frequently."
6010,按照这一看法，自然，不论是我们自己的或是外在的自然，都只是整个存在的一部分。,"In this view, nature, whether our own or external nature, is simply part of the totality of existence."
6010,疾病与愈合、恐惧与希望、无意识与有意识，在完整的生活中都会被体验到。,"Disease, healing, fears, and hopes, the unconscious and consciousness, are experienced in unity with all life."
6010,这一根深蒂固的融为一体感，引发了强有力的医疗仪式，这些仪式可以在从非洲到马来半岛到土著美国人的部族背景中找到。,This deep-rooted sense of unity generates the powerful healing rituals found in tribal contexts from Africa to Malaya to native America.
6011,这位民族志作者对批判理论的表述是嵌入在工人阶级的经验当中的。,The ethnographer's articulation of the critical theory embedded in working class experience.
6011,对于西方的文化批评传统，尤其是马克思主义传统来说，民族志目前最具吸引力之处就是威利斯（也是陶西格）所采取的这一动向，即用民族志来表现嵌入于民族志对象日常境遇与谈话中的对资本主义社会最有力而独特的批判，其力度和独特性甚至超过了那些自觉地以文化批评为职责的知识分子所作出的贡献。,"One of the great current attractions of ethnography to traditions of cultural criticism in the West, and especially the Marxist tradition, is the move that Willis makes (as does Taussig) in letting ethnography demonstrate that the most powerful and novel criticisms of capitalist society lie embedded in the everyday conditions and talk of ethnographic subjects, more powerful and novel even than the contributions of intellectuals whose self-conscious task cultural criticism has been."
6011,可以说，民族志作者是助产士，他接生出并清晰地表达出在工人阶级生活中用俚词俗语所表述的东西，由此也表现了中产阶级的生活。,"The ethnographer is the midwife, as it were, who delivers and articulates what is vernacularly expressed in working class lives, and for that matter, middle class lives."
6012,因此，种姓制度根据归属身份将人分等级，它提供了各种规范调整不同种姓成员之间的相互关系，并通过劳动分工制造了种姓间的相互依赖，而劳动分工则意味着特定的任务只能由特定类别的种姓来执行。,"The caste system thus entails a ranking of people according to ascribed statuses, it provides rules regulating the interrelationships between members of different castes, and it creates mutual dependence of the castes through the division of labour, which implies that certain tasks can only be carried out by members of specified castes."
6012,关于意识形态和宗教方面，种姓制度基于仪式化的洁净和不洁净的观念，而这种观念用来证明不同种姓之间的分离和劳动分工的正当性。,"Regarding ideology and religion, the caste system is based on notions of ritual purity and impurity, which serve to justify the segregation and division of labour between the castes."
6012,仪式化洁净的变化程度意味着，如果高级种姓的成员吃了由低级种姓成员所准备的食物，那么这个高级种姓成员就被污染了，诸如此类。而且，只有婆罗门（Brahmin）的成员才有资格领导宗教仪式。,"The variations in ritual purity imply, among other things, that a member of a high caste will be polluted if he or she eats food prepared by a member of a low caste, and that only members of the Brahmin caste are entitled to lead religious rituals."
6013,现代单一民族国家内部的文化同质化也可以从另外的角度有助于解释种族复兴。,Cultural homogenisation within the modern nation-state may contribute to explaining ethnic revitalisation in other ways as well.
6013,第二次世界大战以来，印度-特立尼达人与其余的特立尼达人进入了更加密切的关系，这使许多领域中的种族边界或是被消解掉或是面临了挑战，许多印度人因此感到他们的身份受到了威胁，并且将“克里奥尔化当成对印度人的“生活方式”完整性的一种危险物。,"Since the Second World War, Indo-Trinidadians have entered into more intensive relationships with the rest of the Trinidadian population, which has led to the erasure or challenging of ethnic boundaries in a number of fields.Many Indians have therefore felt that their identity is threatened, and speak of ""creolisation"" as a danger to the integrity of the Indian ""way of life""."
6013,他们对于所理解的克里奥尔化做出的反应之一是有意识的二分法和对独特性的过度传达。,A response to perceived creolisation has been conscious dichotomisation and overcommunication of distinctiveness.
6013,一般来说，我们可以认为，当种族身份的载体感到身份受到威胁的那一刻，那么种族身份就开始变得重要。,"In general, we might say that an ethnic identity becomes important the moment its carriers feel that it is threatened."
6014,大型的考古学项目也启动了。,Major archaeological projects were launched.
6014,此外，人类学家们还受聘于各类对种族关系和乡村社区的研究。,Anthropologists were also hired to do studies of race relations and of rural communities.
6014,激进的政治活动是普遍存在的，尤其是在纽约，博厄斯的第三代学生与他们的前辈相比，政治的参与度要更高。,"Radical politics were common, especially in New York, and this third generation of Boas's students was more politically engaged than their predecessors."
6014,这也反映在他们的研究项目中，这些项目通常在启动时像正规的博厄斯学派的研究，但随后就加入了经济学和历史学的成分——历史学这时意味着与美国印第安人接触的真实经历。,"This was reflected in their research projects, which often started out as formal Boasian studies but then incorporated economics and history—history that now meant the real contact experiences of American Indians."
6015,19世纪最著名的种族灭绝事件之一，是对位于澳大利亚以南的一个大岛——塔斯马尼亚岛上的原住民的大清洗。,"One of the most famous 19th-century acts of genocide was the extermination of the Aboriginal inhabitants of Tasmania, a large island just south of Australia."
6015,在这个案例中，军事力量没能完全消灭塔斯马尼亚人，但军队没做到的，却被一个传教士做到了。,"In this case, the use of military force failed to achieve the complete elimination of the Tasmanians, but what the mil­itary could not achieve, a missionary could."
6015,乔治·奥古斯特·鲁宾逊设法把剩下的原住民都集合到他的传教所里，在那里，精神沮丧和欧洲人疾病的致命结合导致最后一批纯种塔斯马尼亚人的死亡，此时鲁宾逊——颇为富有的人士——退休回到英国。,"George Augustus Robinson was able to round up the surviving natives, and at his mission station the deadly combination of psychological depres­sion and European diseases brought about the demise of the last full-blooded Tasmanians in time for Robinson to retire to England a moderately wealthy man."
6016,我们所熟悉的对种族偏见最软弱无力的一个心理学解释来自已故的博阿斯。,One of the weakest of psychological explanations of race prejudice with which we are acquainted is that given once by the late Franz Boas.
6016,他说，种族偏见“本质上是建立在……将个人溶合在他所隶属的阶级之中，并将其全部阶级特性归属到他身上的人类精神倾向之上的。,"The prejudice, he said, ""...is founded essentially ... on the tendency of the human mind to merge the individual in the class to which he belongs, and to ascribe to him all the characteristics of his class."""
6016,尽管博阿斯向我们保证，根据人类精神的这一倾向，“并不难理解”这一切，但我们对于将个人与“他所隶属的阶级”融为一体的人类精神倾向究竟怎样导致种族偏见和种族冲突，仍然不甚明了。,"Just how the tendency of the human mind to identify an individual with ""the class to which he belongs"" produces racial prejudice and antagonism is not quite clear although Boas assures us that it ""is not difficult to understand"" in the light of this tendency of the human mind."
6017,否则将会有太多的边界需要进行巨大的变更，而且即使进行了变更，之后仍会有很多的少数民族继续占据很多的居留地，原因是为了实现一个领土国家对应一个民族而以这种方法来和平解决国家和民族的问题，希望极其渺茫。,"Too many boundaries would require too drastic revision, too many minorities would persist in too many settings even after revision, for there to be the remotest possibility of peacefully resolving the states-and-nations question in such a way as to match up a single territorial state to each nation."
6017,甚至更进一步说，要确定一对一的模式，还不得不变更大量的边界并进行种族清洗。正如戈特利布所说的，民族主义是当代政治生活中的一个棘手问题。,"There would have to be many boundaryshifts and ethnic cleansings before any one-to-one pattern could be settled.Yet nationalism, as Gottlieb says, is one of the stubbornest facts of contemporary political life."
6018,就像非洲一开始是“我的过去”的过于浪漫化的形象，一个自信的形象，它不可避免地会在切近的观察中动摇——尼日利亚有它自己的问题，一个美国人不可能如此容易地进入一套非洲的角色——同样，美国也因它的种族主义现实或个人幻想（例如她父亲的）也不能被接受。,"Just as Africa is initially an over - romanticized image of ""my past,"" an image of self - confidence, one that inevitably is shaken by a closer look — Nigeria has its own problems, an American does not slip so easily into an African set of roles — so, too, America is not to be accepted in its realities of racism or individual fantasies (such as those of her father)."
6018,戈尔登从她非洲的痛苦经验中回到波士顿（是波士顿，因为它不是华盛顿或纽约，她在后两个城市长大，那里有太多回归的牵引力）。,"Golden returns from her or deal in Africa to Boston (Boston because it is not Washington or New York, where she grew up and where there are too many regressive pulls)."
6018,在那里她发现种族的氛围几乎是不可忍受的。,There she finds the racial atmosphere almost unbearable.
6018,不过，人们有一种感觉，她现在只有通过成为一个更强更富的人才能帮助改变这种情形。,"One has the feeling, however, that she will now help to change the situation simply by being a stronger, richer person."
6019,重负体制是一种公民宗教等级制度，在轮流的基础上，它把大部分社区的公职和礼仪职务结合起来。,"A cargo system is a civil-religious hierarchy, which, on a revolving basis，combines most of a community's civic and ceremonial offices."
6019,所有职务都向所有人开放，最终每个人实际上至少任一个职务一期，每一任期延续一年。,"All offices are open to all men, and eventually virtually every man has at least one term in office, each term lasting for 1 year."
6019,这一等级制度是金字塔形的，这就是说在比较低的层次上有比较多的职位，向顶端职位逐级递减&例如，一个约有8000人的社区可能有4个层次的职位，在最底层有32个职位，向上一层有12个，再上一层6个，而顶端有2个。,"The scale is pyramidal, which means more offices exist at the lower levels, with progressively fewer toward the top.For example, a community of about 8,000 people may have four levels of offices, with 32 on the lowest level, 12 on the next one up, 6 on the next, and 2 at the apex."
6019,在最底层的职位包括那些做各种各样不体面家庭杂务的职务，诸如扫地和送信。,"Positions at the lowest level include those for the performance of various menial chores, such as sweeping and carrying messages."
6020,与此相反，后现代的世界在某种意义上是没有时间的；过去、现在和未来共存于所有话语中，因此我们可以以同样的意义说所有的重复都是虚构的，所有的差异也都是幻想。,"In contrast, the postmodern world is in a sense timeless; past, present, and future coexist in all discourse, and so we may say with equal sense that all repetitions are fictive and all differences are illusions."
6020,我们会说守恒（conservation）状态不是客体的而是时间的。,We may say that conservation is not of objects but of time.
6020,客体在变，但时间不变，这就使得我们有理由说，当我们两次看到相同的客体时，其实它们并不相同。,"Objects change, but time does not, which makes it reasonable for us to say that when we see the same object twice it is not the same."
6020,没有什么事物是相同的，只有时间，但它不是事物也无法觉察。,"No thing is the same, just time, which is no thing and not perceivable."
6020,以同一性的语言说“我看到了相同的东西”或“它变化了”或“它移动了”，需要变化的时间和不变的客体与主体，但话语可以随心所欲地制造这三者——时间、主体和客体，它并不被名词的霸权所奴役，也不被不变的主体对不变的客体的感知所奴役。,"To speak in the language of identities, to say ""I saw the same thing,"" or ""it has changed,"" or ""it has moved"" requires a changed time and changeless objects and subjects, but a discourse can make all three — time, subject, and object — what it will.It is not enslaved by the hegemony of the noun, by the perception of changeless objects by changeless subjects."
6021,我的历史主义的观念受到了弗雷徳里克˙杰姆逊最近作品（Jameson 1980，1981，1984a.b)的很大影响。,"My notion of historicism owes a great deal to the recent work of Fredric Jameson (1980, 1981, 1984a, b)."
6021,不过，我没有接受他时常援用的、作为对后现代碎片化（认为历史是由各种地方叙亊织成的）之替代物的主导叙事（生产模式的全球序列）。,"I am not, however, persuaded by the master narrative (a global sequence of modes of production) he invokes from time to time as an alternative to post-modern fragmentation (the sense that history is composed of various local narratives)."
6021,我在导自中力主的不完全性（partiality)总是预先假定了一个地方性历史的困境，这一历史主义的不完全性不同于拉比诺指责一个有点僵硬地定义的“后现代主义”所说的没有置于情境之中的“不完全性与变迁”（见本书第304）页。,"The partiality I have been urging in this introduction always presupposes a local historical predicament.This historicist partiality is not the unsituated ""partiality and flux"" with which Rabinow (see p. 352 ) taxes a somewhat rigidly defined ""post-modernism."""
6022,实际上，所有的思考和所有的人类经验都可以说具有主观性：我们脑中的想象构建了“外部世界”，协调了我们的感觉器官和神经网络。,"Indeed, all thinking and all human experience can be said to be subjective: a matter of the images our brains make about the ""external world"", a matter of the mediation of our sense organs and neural pathways."
6022,即使疼痛也是创造出来的想象。,Even pain is a created image.
6022,虽然19世纪的科学声称这种主观性“实际上”是客观的，可是后者才是一种幻觉。,"And while nineteenth-century science founded itself on the claim that this subjectivity was ""in fact"" objective, it was the latter which was illusory."
6022,人的知识和知识的前提条件无疑都是个人性；知识是观察者眼中的关系。,"Human knowledge and conditions of knowledge are always, and inevitably, personal; knowledge is a relationship in the eye of the beholder."
6023,主位-客位的二分法是由马文·哈里斯（Marvin Harris 1964，1979）引人人类学的，但是其最先是由语言学家肯尼思·派克（Kenneth Pike）提出（参见 Headland et al. 1990），从语言学对音位术语和语音术语进行区分而来，分别指语音间的客观关系和语音意义间的客观关系。,"The emic–etic dichotomy was introduced into anthropology by Marvin Harris (1964, 1979), but it was first developed by the linguist Kenneth Pike (see Headland et al. 1990), who derived the terms from the linguistic distinction between phonetics and phonemics, referring to the objective relationship between sounds and the meaning of sounds, respectively."
6023,“当地人的观点”是主位，而人类学家的分析视角是客位。,"The ""native's point of view"" is emic, whereas the analytical perspective of the anthropologist is etic."
6023,但是，尽管人类学家的目标是用受访者的感知方式重现现实，却有三个理由可以说明这种结果不可能成为一种主位描述。,"However, even if the anthropologist aims to reproduce reality the way it is perceived by the informants, there are three reasons why the result may never be an emic description."
6023,首先，我们必须经常在两种不同的语言之间进行翻译，而翻译与原样是有区别的。,"First, we must usually translate between two different languages, and the translation is different from the original."
6024,一个家户通常但不是必然地由亲戚们组成；同样，常常是但不必然地，家户由同一屋檐下的人们组成。,"A household usually, but not always, consists of people who are relatives; it also frequently, but not always, consists of people who live under the same roof."
6024,最常见的家户定义如下：一个家户包括那些定期在一起共进午餐的人。,The most common definition of a household is as follows: a household includes those persons who regularly eat their main meals together.
6024,为什么住在同一居所不能构成主要的标准？原因很简单，许多民族的居住安排中，男人、女人和青年住在不同的小屋。下面的例子，一个来自西非，一个来自加勒比海，揭示了家户结构之间的重要区别，可能也暗示了对于不同群体之间的其他异同点来说，这种差异的意义。,"The reason that a shared domicile does not form the chief criterion is simply the fact that many peoples have living arrangements whereby men, women and youths live in different huts.The following examples, one from West Africa and one from the Caribbean, reveal important differences between household structures and may hint at the significance of such variation for other differences and similarities between societies."
6025,他们还倾向于将民族主义看成是现代化的产物和现代特征。,They also tend to see nations and nationalisms as products of modernisation and features of modernity.
6025,从根本上说，许多“现代主义者”实际上都是唯物主义者。,"Many of these ""modernist"" theories are, at root, materialist."
6025,在一些情况下，唯物主义是明确的。,"In some cases, the materialism is explicit."
6025,举例来说，汤姆·耐恩（Tom Nairn）视民族主义为资本主义“不平衡发展”的产物和回应。,"Tom Nairn, for example, regards nationalism as the product of, and response to, the ""uneven development"" of capitalism."
6026,此书包括了大量“冬季合计” (Winter Qnmts)(拉科塔记录）和历史事件的个人回忆，这与质疑过于清晰地划分“有”历史和“没有”历史的人民的最近趋向一致（Rosaldo 1980；Price 1983）。,"T h e inclusion of extensive Winter Counts (Lakota annals) and personal recollections of historical events confirms recent tendencies to question overly clear distinctions between peoples ""with"" and ""without"" history (Rosaldo 1980; Price 1983)."
6026,第三卷是《拉科塔神话》（Walkerl983）。,Volume three is Lakota Myth (1983).
6026,最后一卷将包括译成英文的索德作品。,A n d the last will contain the translated writings of George Sword.
6026,乔治˙索德是一位奧格拉拉武士，后成为松树岭的印第安人犯罪法庭（Court of Indian Offenses）的法官。,"Sword was an Oglala warrior, later a j u d g e of the Court of Indian Offenses at Pine Ridge."
6026,在沃克的鼓励之下，他详细地记录了当地的习俗生活，包括神话、仪式、战争与游戏，并附有他的自传。,"With Walker's encouragement, he wrote a detailed vernacular record of customary life, covering myth, ritual, warfare and games, complemented by an autobiography."
6027,这就是我向第二组撰稿人提出的问题：他们中一位是国际法方面的杰出理论家和实践者，再一位是国际关系方面的学术权威。前者是达尼洛·蒂尔克（Danilo Türk)，在民族自决的特殊表演中扮演着重要的角色。他的国家斯洛文尼亚在1991年6月宣布独立，从此南斯拉夫联盟开始瓦解（恰巧，他现在在联合国担任斯洛文尼亚代表）。,"This was the question I posed to the next pair of contributors: an outstanding theorist and practitioner of international law, and a leading academic authority on international relations.The former, Danilo Türk, played an important role in a specific act of national self-determination, when his country, Slovenia, declared itself independent in June 1991, thereby initiating the formal dissolution of the Yugoslav Federation.(Appropriately enough, he now represents Slovenia at the United Nations.)"
6028,自我意识不是一下子获得的。,Self-awareness does not come all at once.
6028,"例如，在现代北美社会,儿童直到大约2岁时才达到自我与非自我的明确区分。","In modern North American society, for example, self and nonself are not clearly distinguished until about 2 years of age."
6028,然而，北美儿童这种自我意识的发展，可能有点落后于其他一些文化。,"This development of self-awareness in North American children, however, may lag somewhat behind other cultures."
6028,自我意识与运动神经的发展是同步的，我们知道，北美婴儿开始这种同步发展，其比率要低于许多（也许甚至是大多数）非西方社会的婴儿。,"Self-awareness develops in concert with neuromotor development, which is known to proceed at a slower rate in infants from North America than in infants in many, perhaps even most, non-Western societies."
6028,虽然我们知道婴儿接受人的接触和刺激的量起重要作用，但我们还不明白这种较低比率的原因。,"The reasons for this slower rate are not yet clear, although the amount of human contact and stimulation infants receive seems to play an important role."
6028,例如，在美国，婴儿一般并不与他们的父母同睡，大多数婴儿通常被放在他们自己的房间里。,"In the United States, for example, infants generally do not sleep with their parents, most often being put in rooms of their own."
6028,人们把这种做法看作是重要的一步，这使他们成为个人，他们自已和他们能力的“所有者'而不是某个社会整体的一部分。所以，他们被剥夺了一系列刺激，包括他们与父母一起睡觉时会得到的抚摸、气味、运动和温暖。,"This deprives them of a steady stream of stimuli, including touch, smell, movement, and warmth, they would receive by cosleeping."
6029,我反对这种看法，将其称为“主权国家民族主义”（sovereign-state nationalism）。它与英国和其他地方的保守的欧洲怀疑主义密切相关。,"This view, which I reject, I shall here name ""sovereign-state nationalism"", associating it with Conservative Euro-scepticism in the United Kingdom and elsewhere."
6029,现在的问题在于，能否找到其他更能令人接受的民族主义来抗衡主权国家民族主义。,The issue is whether there is any more acceptable nationalism to set against sovereign-state nationalism.
6029,我认为这完全可能，并且提出“自由民族主义”（liberal nationalism）的概念。,"I think there is.What I propose goes by the name of ""liberal nationalism""."
6030,民族认同主要源自公民因素，虽然要承认的是，它也会包含文化和族裔因素，但后者只有符合我所提出的其他限制条件时才能实现。不必说，自由主义是一个颇具争议的概念或政治思想、计划的集合体。,"The identity of the nation is conceived primarily in civic terms, though it is to be acknowledged that this will also draw in elements of the cultural and the ethnic; these latter are accepted only to the extent that they are compatible with the other constraints for which I argue.Needless to say, liberalism is a much-contested concept or family of political ideas and programmes."
6030,但是，要想准确判断一种思想是否属于自由主义思想，必须以两种原则或态度为基础，即普遍主义和个人主义。,But two principles or attitudes should be seen as fundamental for anything credibly recognisable as belonging to the family of liberal thought.These are universalism and individualism.
6031,全球化、政治动荡、共产主义体系出现的崩溃和世界各地为自决发生的流血冲突，重新唤醒了原生论的载体：族性、部落、种族、语言、宗教和民族。,"Globalisation, political instability, the collapse of communism and the bloody fights for self-determination all over the globe have re-energised the primordial standard-bearers – ethnicity, tribe, race, language, religion and nation."
6031,这些冲突以及助长冲突的情绪无疑存在构成因果关系的潜在因素。,Such conflicts and the sentiments that fuel them may – indeed do undoubtedly – have underlying causal elements.
6031,但是冲突参与者将这些冲突定义、理解和接受为原生性质。,"But these conflicts are defined, understood and accepted as primordial by their participants."
6032,板球就这样被用来加强传统的宗族身份。,Cricket is thereby used to strengthen traditional clan identity.
6032,另一方面，很明显，特罗布里恩德的文化遭遇了殖民以后，远非毫无变化。,"On the other hand, it is clear that Trobriand culture is far from unchanged after its colonial encounter."
6032,对现代化的一种不同类型的反应体现在美拉尼西亚和波利尼西亚的所谓船货崇拜中（Worsley 1968）。,A different kind of reaction to modernisation is represented in the so-called cargo cults of Melanesia and Polynesia (Worsley 1968).
6032,这些千禧年的政治或宗教崇拜最初出现于第一次世界大战之后，作为与外界越来越多的交往的一种后果，而其中有些交往是最新近的。,"These millenary political or religious cults first emerged as a result of increased contact with the outside world after the First World War, and some are much more recent."
6032,他们具有双重目的：重建传统权威，并获得对外来者（大多数是美国人）的巨大财富的控制权。,They have a double aim: to re-establish traditional authority and to achieve control of the immense wealth of the foreigners (mostly Americans).
6032,因此，这些行动在意识形态的层面上，好像可以说，代表了一种新事物和旧事物之间的愉快结合。,"In this, such movements represent, at the ideological level, a happy marriage, as it were, between the old and the new."
6032,因为，如同汝森斯（Roosens 1989）所谈到的，本土民族可能希望既保留他们传统中的重要方面，又想要获得现代商品。,"For as Roosens (1989) has remarked, indigenous peoples may wish to retain important aspects of their tradition, but they also tend to want modern commodities."
6032,必须补充的是，通常，两个目的都不会实现。,"Often, it must be added, neither aim is achieved."
6033,所有人类社会都有这样一些个人——他们的任务是引导和帮助他人完成宗教实践。,In all human societies there exist individuals whose job it is to guide and supplement the religious practices of others.
6033,这样的人非常擅长于同超自然存在打交道，对超自然存在施加影响，操纵超自然力量。,Such individuals are highly skilled at contacting and influencing supernatural beings and manipulating supernatural forces.
6033,通常，他们之所以有此素质是因为他们受过专业训练。,Their qualification for this is that they have undergone special training.
6034,人类学理论往往在两者之间游离。,Anthropological theory has tended to shift between the two enterprises.
6034,在大多数时间里，人类学家都在研究文化事项而不是文化概念本身。,"For much of the time, anthropologists have studiedcultural things, rather than culture itself."
6034,他们时不时地瞟一眼黑匣子的特性，因为理论的焦点一直都在关注文化所包含的内容：亲属制度、象征主义、交换系统、宗教信仰等等。,"The nature of the black box has been glimpsed from time to time, as the theoretical spotlight has focused on its contents: kinship, symbolism, systems of exchange, religious beliefs."
6034,然而，关注的焦点偶尔也会转向文化概念本身，重新勾勒黑匣子的形貌和层面。,"Periodically, however, the spotlight has been turned on culture itself, and the shape and dimensions of the black box have been redrawn."
6034,在社会科学（包括人类学在内）理论的重要转变时期，发生这样的事情并不奇怪，比如，在20世纪60—70年代就发生过。,"This has tended to happen, not surprisingly, during important fundamental shifts in social science theory, in which anthropology has participated.It happened, for instance, during the 1960s and 1970s."
6035,"第三个区分是“横组合关系”和“纵聚合关系""    (Saussure 1974: 122 - 127 ) 。",The third distinction is between syntagmatic and associative relations (Saussure 1974: 122–7).
6035,继路易斯• 叶姆斯列夫 ( Louis  Hjelmslev )  之后的近数十年，大多数结构主义者都把后者称为”选择关系”。,"Following Louis Hjelmslev, most structuralists of recent decades have referred to the latter as ‘paradigmatic’."
6035,“横组合关系”实际是指句子中的各种关系。,Syntagmatic relations are literally those within a sentence.
6036,如果能区分爱国主义与民族主义，问题似乎就迎刃而解了。,"If we distinguish between patriotism and nationalism, our difficulties appear to be resolved."
6036,如果能将爱国主义视为民族主义的温和形式也可以解决问题，因为大部分人（即使不是所有的人）都认为存在一些在道德上值得尊敬的爱国主义形式。,"We could call patriotism the benign sort of nationalism and end the matter there, since most, though not all, people think that there are morally respectable forms of patriotism."
6036,当然，正如萨缪尔·约翰逊（Samuel Johnson）所说，爱国主义依然是恶棍、流氓的最终避难所，但只发生在它作为流氓行为的借口的时候。,"Of course it remains the last refuge of a scoundrel, as Samuel Johnson said, but only when it is offered as an excuse for the behaviour of scoundrels."
6037,即使是大国的政府尚且会因为毒品交易而受到指责。,The governments of even large states are known to have been tarnished by the drug trade.
6037,试想如果这个世界是由大量独立的小国组成的，那么那些具有致命威胁的活动，诸如核物资的违法交易、恐怖主义行为和传染病的传播等将会极其难以对付。,"The control of deadly threats – such as the illicit trade in nuclear materials, terrorism and the spread of epidemics – would be greatly complicated in a world of many more small independent states."
6037,可见，当少数民族和小群体的文化、权利不被承认时，分离或完全独立便成为它们唯一的出路。,"However, where small nations and communities are denied their culture and the exercise of their rights, the problem has a different hue.Separation and full independence may then be the only way out."
6037,因此，我们可以说，在任何情况下，都不能借口“消极共识”分裂和巴尔干化来阻止民族摆脱种族灭绝或残暴统治的愿望。,"The ‘negative consensus’ against fragmentation and Balkanisation cannot be allowed to block, in every case, the aspirations of nations desperate to free themselves from genocidal or tyrannical masters."
6038,在离婚仍是丑闻而离婚率又十分低的社会中，包办婚姻不仅是新娘与新郎之间，也是两个家庭之间终身关系的开端。,"In a society where divorce is still a scandal and where, in fact, the divorce rate is exceedingly low, an arranged marriage is the beginning of a life-time relationship not just between the bride and groom but between their families as well."
6038,因此，姑娘的外貌很重要，性格更加重要，因为人们同时从两方面评价她:未来的媳妇和未来的新娘。,"Thus, while a girl's looks are important her character is even more so, for she is being judged as a prospective daughter-in-law as much as a prospective bride."
6038,她将生活在联合家庭内，我朋友的情况就是这样，因此，在评价姑娘是否合适时，她与家庭成员和睦相处的能力也许是最重要的品质。,"Where she would be living in a joint family, as was the case with my friend, the girl's ability to get along harmoniously in a family is perhaps the single most important quality in assessing her suitability."
6039,然而，这种无知并不出人意料。,This ignorance is not surprising however.
6039,我们放弃对女巫施以火刑、为驱赶恶魔鞭挞癔病患者和其它原始作法尚为时不久，甚至在往往走在社会和意识形盔因桌之前的技术领域，我们也只是在两方面，即用火和使用弓箭这两方面超过了原始人。,"It has not been very long since we gave up burning witches, cudgelling hysterics to drive out demons, and other savage practices.Even in technology, which tends to outstrip the social and ideological sectors, we have surpassed the savage at two points—fire-making and the use of the bow and arrow—only within the last century or two."
6039,化学火柴不过有一个世纪的历史，而在以往100年间，箭在用于捕猎美洲平原上的野牛方面优于当时可资利用的任何一件火器。,Chemical matches are but a little more than a century old and the bow and arrow was used in bison hunting on the American plains in preference to the best firearms available at the time within the last hundred years.
6039,从文化上说，人类中的一小部分脱离原始状态不过是昨天的事情。,"It is only yesterday, culturologically speaking, that a small portion of mankind began to emerge from a condition of savagery."
6040,包括人在内的生态系统，被当做一个自我调节的体系进行了分析。,"The ecosystem, including the people in it, is analysed as a self-regulating system."
6040,拉帕波特显示了：在给定的地区内，当猪群和人的数目达到临界水平时，宰牲节就开始了，接着会爆发暴力事件；然后，生态系统接近其维持的极限。,"Rappaport shows that the kaiko begins, and violence breaks out, when the number of pigs and humans in a given area has reached a critical level; then the ecosystem is near the limits of its sustainability."
6040,在仪式循环完成之后，临界值会降低而系统被稳定。,"After the completion of the ritual cycle, the critical values decrease and the system is stabilised."
6041,对于这个雄心勃勃的计划，埃文斯·普里查德已经做过敏锐的阐述：“在社会人类学中只有一种方法——比较方法——那是不可能的。,"Of this ambitious project, Evans-Pritchard is reported to have remarked, shrewdly, ""There's only one method in social anthropology – the comparative method – and that is impossible."""
6041,”埃文斯·普里查德暗示了两个真理。,Evans-Pritchard implies two truths.
6041,没有哪一个民族志描述是彻底的特殊化，至少在下面这一意义上所有的民族志都是比较的：即民族志学者必须将其从其研究的人民那里学到的东西传达给其他人民，他的读者；在这一传递中就包括隐含的比较。,"No ethnographic descriptionis entirely particularistic, all are comparative in at least one sense: the ethnographer must communicate the truths of the people he studies to other people, his readers; such communication entails implicit comparison."
6042,否则将会有太多的边界需要进行巨大的变更，而且即使进行了变更，之后仍会有很多的少数民族继续占据很多的居留地，因此，企图以一个领土国家对应一个民族的办法来解决国家和民族的问题，以实现和平，这种希望是极其渺茫的。甚至更进一步说，要确定一对一的模式，还不得不变更大量的边界并进行种族清洗。,"Too many boundaries would require too drastic revision, too many minorities would persist in too many settings even after revision, for there to be the remotest possibility of peacefully resolving the states-and-nations question in such a way as to match up a single territorial state to each nation."
6042,问题：错译改1：否则将会有太多的边界需要进行巨大的变更，而且即使进行了变更，之后仍会有很多的少数民族继续占据很多的居留地，原因是为了实现一个领土国家对应一个民族而以这种方法来和平解决国家和民族的问题，希望极其渺茫。,
6042,甚至更进一步说，要确定一对一的模式，还不得不变更大量的边界并进行种族清洗。,There would have to be many boundaryshifts and ethnic cleansings before any one-to-one pattern could be settled.
6043,交谈作为焦点、主题和描述的对象对于人类学的表述来说并不陌生。,"Conversation as focus, theme and image is no stranger to anthropological representation."
6043,有人认为人类学的文本将会传达出与消息人的交谈。消息人的讲述、与之的辩论、信息的加工甚至责备，这些都会引发田野中精确的口头表述或其他表达方式（参照 Favret-Saada 1980；Rapport 1987；Cohen 1989)。,"It is expected that the anthropological text will convey conversation between informants; oratory, disputation, curing and cursing might all elicit precise reportage of the verbal and other expression and exchange in the field (cf. Favret-Saada 1980; Rapport 1987; Cohen 1989)."
6044,社区曾被视为是经验主义上的自在之物（社会组织作为功能性的整体，与其他亊物相区分。,"Communities have been regarded as empirical things-in-themselves (social organisms), as functioning wholes, and as things apart from other like things."
6044,这后来成为社区研究的逻辑基础：人类学传统上的基础研究就是基于这样一种观念，即一个相可关联的人的群体，具有文化上的同质性，定居于某一地点，因为这样的“社区”能够为近距离地观察他们之间的相互关系和延续的相互作用提供试验平台；也为那些史大规模或更复杂的社会图景提供一个缩影。,"This was in turn the logical basis of ""the community study"": the tradition in anthropology of basing research on what could in some sense be treated as a bounded group of people, culturally homogeneous and resident in one locality, because this ""community"" would provide a laboratory for the close observation of the interrelations, the continuing interfunctioning, between interests, sub-groups and institutions; and also serve as a microcosm of a bigger social picture which might prevail as societies grew in size and complexity."
6044,人类学家研究社区(村庄、部落和岛屿）是因为这些被看作是社会生活的关键性结构单元：比如亲属制度的基本结构体现了什么；比如复杂的社会结构由哪些部分构成。,"Anthropologists conventionally studied communities (villages, tribes, islands) because these were regarded as the key structural units of social life: what the elementary structures of kinship gave onto; what the complex structures of society were composed of."
6045,我们可以研究它是怎样被制造出来的，我们可以发现在它之前存在着什么。,"We can study how it was made, and we can discover what there was before it."
6045,首先，有必要界定我所指的“族性”的含义是什么。,"It is necessary, first, to define what I mean by ethnicity."
6045,在非洲，我把它与“部落制”等同使用，也就是说，是一个相当大的人民群体（group of people）的自我意识存在，他们使用相同的语言，抱有相同的政治思想、法律观念和宗教信仰，拥有历史起源相同的神话故事。,"In Africa I equate it with ""tribalism"", that is to say, the self conscious existence of a fairly large group of people who share the same language, operate with the same political, judicial and religious ideas, and hold the same myths of historical origin."
6046,性别和年龄都具有生物的和文化的方面。,Gender and age have both biological and cultural aspects.
6046,年龄并不必然地直接和性别相互关联。,Age is not necessarily directly correlated with gender.
6046,例如，在喀麦隆的白克瑞人（Bakweri）中间，一个男人要在40岁之前结婚几乎是不可能的，因为他必须要拥有财产和政治影响力才能得到一个妻子。,"Among the Bakweri of Cameroon, for example, it is nearly impossible for a man to get married before he reaches the age of 40, since he must have property and political influence to find a wife."
6046,另一方面，女人在性成熟以后不久就结婚了。,"Women, on the other hand, are married shortly after sexual maturity."
6046,相对来说，孩子们通常被认为是没有性的，他们的社会化常常以获得双重结果为目的：使他们成为社会的成员，以及使他们成为男人和女人。,"Children are often considered relatively sexless, and their socialisation frequently aims at achieving a double end: to turn them into members of society, and to turn them into men and women."
6046,因为这样的原因，男孩和女孩的过渡仪式通常明显不同。,"For this reason, rites of passage for girls and boys usually differ markedly."
6046,居住在新几内亚高地哈根山（Mount Hagen）附近的民族有一个普遍的观点认为，婴儿出生时既具有男性特质，也具有女性特质。,"Among the people who live near Mount Hagen in highland New Guinea (Strathern 1988), it is a common view that infants are born with both male and female properties."
6046,为了成为男人和女人，他们必须经历一个很长的学习过程，这个过程在一系列的青春期的仪式中画上句号。,"For them to become women and men, they have to go through a long process of learning which culminates in a series of puberty rites."
6047,"尽管裁决过程并非人类社会的普遍特征,但每个社会都会用某种形式的谈判来解决争端。","Although the adjudication process is not universally characteristic, every society employs some form of negotiation to settle disputes."
6047,谈判往往是裁决的先决条件或替代办法。,Often negotiation acts as a prerequisite or an alternative to adjudication.
6047,例如，在美国解决劳资纠纷，罢工工人首先会与资方谈判，通常借助于第三方的调解。,"For example, in the resolution of U.S. labor disputes, striking workers may first negotiate with management, often with the mediation of a third party."
6048,彩礼创造了人们之间的几种道德纽带。,Payment of bridewealth creates several kinds of moral bonds between people.
6048,首先，它在不同家系之间创造了一种契约关系，作为相互信任的一种符号。,"First, it creates a contractual tie between lineages, being a sign of mutual trust."
6048,当彩礼是以一种长期的方式给付时，如新郎为他的岳父母劳动一段时间提供服务，这种纽带会被进一步加强。,"When the bridewealth is paid over a long period, for example through bride-service whereby the groom works for a certain period for his parents-in-law, the bonds are strengthened further."
6048,其次，彩礼系统为给付彩礼的家族群体内部加强了团结。,"Second, the system of bridewealth strengthens solidarity within the paying group."
6048,通常，一些亲戚必须为彩礼贡献一二，而新郎也常常从他的亲戚那里借债。,"Frequently, several relatives must contribute to the payment of the price, and often the groom must borrow from his relatives."
6049,文化是阐释视角的核心概念。,Culture is the central concept of the interpretive perspective.
6049,文化是共有的意义。,Culture is shared meaning.
6049,要领会意义，一个人必须像其他人看世界那样去看世界，必须按照他人的框架参照系去理解他人的体验。,"To comprehend meaning, one must see the world as others see it, to comprehend experience in terms of the others' frame of reference."
6049,这是阐释性民族志的努力所在。,This is the endeavor of interpretive ethnography.
6049,阐释性民族志没有宏大的故事要讲，至少从进化论视角来看那一点不是特别引人注目。,"Interpretive ethnography has no grand story to tell, at least none that is particularly striking from the evolutionary viewpoint."
6050,在《文化的阐释》一书的前言中，格尔茨论述了阐释主义人类学的核心。这本书于1973年完成并出版——正是埃文斯-普里查德去世的那一年。,"The core of his interpretivist anthropology, though, lies in the introductory essay to his book The Interpretation of Cultures, which was com- pleted and published in 1973 – the year of Evans-Pritchard’s death."
6050,书中格尔茨总结他的方法是一种“深描”（Geertz 1973: 3 -30)。,There Geertz (1973: 3–30) sums up his approach as one of ‘thick description’.
6051,格尔茨称之为“常识性的声音”，具有五个基本特征。,"There is what Geertz calls a ‘commonsensical voice’, with five distinctive features."
6051,首先，常识确定哪些事物是“自然的”：即世界固有的内在特征。,"First, common sense claims to identify things which are ‘natural’: inevitable, intrinsic to the world."
6051,其次，常识提供了至高无上的做事情的实践智慧。,"Second, common sense claims to be a superlatively practical wisdom for getting things done."
6051,它采取奇闻轶事、笑话、格言和谚语的形式；与此同时带来相互分离且异类的区分，甚至是相互冲突的矛盾和迥异的风格，但也会为参与社会生活提出各种各样的实际的策略。,"The forms it takes are anecdotes, jokes, maxims and proverbs; together these may amount to a disparate, heterogeneous, even contradictory, pot-pourri, but they also provide practical advice for engaging with life in all its multifariousness."
6051,第三，常识所涉及和阐释的关于世界的真理是明晰、显著和朴素的；是任何清醒的人都能够明了的。,"Third, common sense claims that the truths of the world which it enunciates are obvious, patent and plain; it is what anybody who is sober can see."
6051,第四，常识能为当下提供适宜的处事智慧。,"Fourth, common sense provides immediate wisdom that fits the moment."
6051,最后，常识是每个人都可获得的智慧，无需专门或特殊的能力，只需成熟和人世。,"Finally, common sense promises wisdom which is accessible to all, needing no expertise or special powers, only maturity and some worldliness."
6051,这些特点勾勒出一个具有普遍性的日常认知和存在模式，而且这与地域相互匹配（“常识”一词与“宗教”、“科学”或“社会学”的区别，基本上是西方的模式）。,"These features, to repeat, demarcate a mode of everyday knowing and being-in-the-world which is universal, however it may locally be dubbed; (the term ‘common sense’, and its distinction from ‘religion’, ‘science’ or ‘sociology’, is merely a Western framing)."
6052,从这个角度看，民族志写作的过程似乎更加复杂。,"Seen in this light, the processes of ethnographic writing appear more complex."
6052,正如德里达可能会说，如果人类学家研究的各种文化往往已经在描写它们自己，“将文化带人写作”的田野工作者-学者的特殊地位就被削弱了。,"If, as Derrida would say, the cultures studied by anthropologists are always already writing themselves, the special status of the fieldworker-scholar who ""brings the culture into writing"" is undercut."
6052,然而，事实上，是谁写下了那个被录到录音机里或被记下来变成田野注释之一部分时神话？,"Who, in fact, writes a myth that is recited into a tape recorder, or copied down to become part of field notes?"
6052,是谁写下了（在超越抄写的意义上）通过与知识渊博的本土合作人热情交谈面产生的那种对风俗的解释？,Who writes (in a sense going beyond transcription) an interpretation of custom produced through intense conversations with knowledgeable native collaborators?
6052,"我已然论证,这些问题可以，也应该产生一种对民族志权威（Clifford 1983a)的再思考","I have argued that such questions can, and should, generate a rethinking of ethnographic authority (Clifford 1983a)."
6053,这些功能源自对话而不是作者及其文本的单声部的内部方言。,They derive from dialogue rather than the monophonie internal dialectic of the author with his text.
6053,即使阿多诺提出，通过否定的辩证法，文章旨在清査所有的观点，但只要它是单声部的，是从一个作者的观点那里投射出来的，它就不能达成这一目标，它只是表达了作者的认知乌托邦（Kauffmann 1981:343—353)。与否定的辩证法不同，对话的相对方无需停留在没有超越可能性的未定的悬置中，但与之一样的是，后现代民族志不在文本内实践综合e,"Even though Adorno argues that the essay, by means of negative dialectics, aims at the liquidation of all viewpoints, it cannot achieve this goal so long as it is monophonie, projected from the viewpoint of a single author.It expresses only the cognitive utopia of the author (Kauffmann 1981:343—53)- Unlike negative dialectics, the oppositions of dialogue need not be held in unresolved suspension without the possibility of transcendence, but like negative dialectics, postmodern ethnography does not practice synthesis within the text.The synoptic transit is a nonsynthetic transcendence that is evoked by, not immanent in, the text."
6054,超自然主义的笞案是封闭式的、终极的答案：上帝创造化石，它是上帝的愿望，事情就是如此，再也没有什么可说的了。,"The answers of supernaturalism were complete and final: God did it; it was God's will, and that was that; there was nothing left to say."
6054,实际上，这些答案没有说出什么东西，它是最终的，因而也是空洞的。,"Actually, of course, these answers told one nothing; they were as empty as they were final."
6054,而且最糟的是它们关闭了通往任何更为完善的解释的大门。在被告知一桩事件不过是上帝的行动使然之后，一个人还能询问或学得什么呢？,"And, worst of all, they shut the door to anything better; what else could one ask or learn after being told that an event was but an act of God?"
6054,用孔德的术语来说，“形而上学”的解释类型至少使人从人类中心主义的束缚中解脱出来。,The metaphysical—to use Comte's term—type of interpretation at least freed one from the bondage of anthropomorphism.
6054,如果化石是由“形成石头的力”所形成的，那么，也就暗含着要人去探讨这一力量的本性，并因而使人与现实世界而不是从现实世界中反射出来的人类自身的形象，建立起直接的联系，从而了解到现实世界的某些知识。,"If fossils were formed by ""stone-making forces,"" one was, by impHcation, invited to inquire into the nature of such forces and thus come into direct contact with the real world—instead of one's own image reflected therein—and to learn something about it as a consequence."
6054,形而上学的解释尽管本身是空泛的，却无疑具有进步性：它开拓了通往更完善的解释即科学的道路。,The metaphysical explanations though empty in themselves were nevertheless progressive; they opened the way to something better: science.
6055,这些最早的毫无疑义的人科成员可能在560万年前就生活在非洲。,The earliest undoubted members of the human family were living in Africa by 5.6 million years ago.
6055,这些原人完全是用两足行走的（能直立行走和奔跑）。,These hominines were fully bipedal (able to walk and run erect).
6055,最著名的是南方古猿，他们有很好的资质在相对开阔的环境里从事广泛的食物采集。,"Best known are the australo-pithecines, who were well equipped for generalized food gathering in a savanna environment."
6055,虽然从腰部以上起仍然明显地像类人猿，但是南方古猿具有完整的人类齿列，这种齿列所具有的许多特点很容易溯源到较早的像类人猿的灵长目动物。,"Although still strikingly apelike from the waist up, australo-pithecines had a fully human dentition with many features easily derivable from earlier apelike primates."
6055,在这些像类人猿的动物中，其中有些动物的生活条件迫使它们花相当多的时间在地上活动，而且他们仿佛已有能力至少偶尔两足直立行走。,"Some of these latter lived under conditions that forced them to spend considerable time on the ground, and they appear to have had the capacity for at least occasional bipedal locomotion."
6056,这些冲突以及助长冲突的情绪无疑存在构成因果关系的潜在因素。,Such conflicts and the sentiments that fuel them may – indeed do undoubtedly – have underlying causal elements.
6056,但是冲突参与者将这些冲突定义、理解和接受为原生性质。,"But these conflicts are defined, understood and accepted as primordial by their participants."
6056,如许多悲伤的家庭所知道的那样，民族冲突可以真的带来后果。,"And as many grieving families know, ethnic conflicts can become very real in their consequences."
6057,虽然文化变迀是下一章才要加以讨论的主题，但如果一点也不提及复兴运动，那么任何对宗教的人类学考察都是不完整的。,"Although the subject of culture change is taken up in a later chapter, no anthropological consideration of religion is complete without some mention of revitalization movements."
6057,1931年，在(太平洋)所罗门群岛上的布卡人，突然兴起了一场本地人的宗教运动，运动的先知预言道，不久会有一场洪水吞没所有的白人。,"In 1931, at Buka in the Solomon Islands, a native religious cult suddenly emerged, its prophets predicting a deluge would soon engulf all Whites."
6057,之后，会有一艘满载着西方工业品的船来到。,This would be followed by the arrival of a ship laden with European goods.
6057,信奉者得建造一个家庭储藏室来储存这些物品，并准备好驱逐殖民地的警察。,The believers were to construct a storehouse for the goods and to prepare themselves to repulse the colonial police.
6057,因为这艘船只有在当地人把他们自己的供给用完之后才会到来，所以他们就停止在田地里劳作了。,"Because the ship would arrive only after the natives had used up all their own supplies, they ceased working in the fields."
6057,尽管这次运动的领导人被捕了，但崇拜持续了好几年。,"Although the cult leaders were arrested, the movement continued for some years."
6058,阿切提很快发现，豚鼠并不只是被界定为某种食物：它们是一种种类的食物，同时是宠物和可以食用的动物。,"Archetti quickly discovered that guinea-pigs were not just defined as any kind of food: they were a special kind of food, simultaneously pets and edible animals."
6058,在村民的生活中，它们具有一种重要的象征地位。,They had an important symbolic place in the lives of the villagers.
6058,豚鼠不是日常被食用的，而是只在特殊的场合食用，比如过渡仪式、宗教庆典和促进康复的时候。,"Guinea-pigs were not eaten daily, but only at special occasions such as rites of passage, religious feasts and in connection with healing."
6058,豚鼠具有特殊性（而从这个角度考虑可以说与厘哩人的穿山甲相当），它也可以被看成是一种预测天气和解释社会事件的神谕。,The guinea-pig had special qualities (and may in this regard be compared to the pangolin among the Lele).It was also seen as an oracle which could divine the weather and interpret social events.
6058,因此，让豚鼠待在身边是很重要的。,"For this reason, it was important to have one's guinea-pigs nearby."
6058,那些具有轻微缺陷的动物会被认为是不寻常的聪明动物，例如，因为它们多了一个脚趾(可能是近亲繁殖的结果）。,"Animals which were mildly disfigured, for example because they had an extra toe (possibly as a result of inbreeding), were considered unusually wise creatures."
6059,尽管传播的重要性很明显，但接受来自另一种文化的创新与接受“本土的”创新相比，要面对更多的障碍。,"Despite the obvious importance of diffusion, accepting an innovation from another culture probably has more obstacles than accepting a ""homegrown"" one."
6059,除了面临与“本土的”创新所面临的相同障碍之外，构 成借来文化障碍的，是这一事实：这些借用品就其性质来说终究是外来的。,"In addition to the same obstacles that stand in the way of homegrown inventions is the fact a borrowed one is, by its very nature, foreign."
6059,"例如, 在美国，这就是人们为什么不愿意完全放弃麻烦难用的旧英制度平衡，而去使用更合理的公制的一个原因，而后者几乎已经被地球上其他所有人接受了（坚持使用这种英制度平衡的，除了美国，就只有南也门和利比里亚了）。","In the United States, for example, this is one reason why people have been so reluctant to abandon completely the awkward and cumbersome old English system of weights and measures for the adopted by just about everyone else on the face of the earth.(The only hold-outs besides the United States are South Yemen and Liberia.)"
6060,传播论和文化区域研究构建了人类学先后产生的思想中最为有意思的观点之一。,Diffusionist and culture-area approaches constitute one of the most interesting sets of ideas anthropology has produced.
6060,"但是，与进化论不同,当前的传播论（例如全球化理论）已经失去了与过去的延续性。","Yet unlike evolutionist ideas, diffusionist ones today (e.g., globalization theory) have lost continuity with the past."
6060,传播论的遗产以其古典形式存在于文化区域研究中——既存在于这些区域之间的历史联系中，而且更重要的，也存在于透彻的区域研究中。,"The primary legacy of diffusionism in its classic form is in the study of culture areas – both historical relations between such areas and, more importantly, the intensive study of regions."
6061,在本文的工作稿中，我将少数族群自传的五个来源（五种族群）分别作为一节讨论，这样做是想提示每个族群内部的自传写作的范围和历史轨迹，以及在每一部分突出一种不同的族群感和获得这种感觉的技术。,"In the working draft o f this paper, the five sources (ethnicities) of ethnic autobiography each provided a separate section.I attempted to suggest something about the range or historical trajectory of autobiographical writing within each ethnicity, as well as to highlight in each section a different sense of, and technique for capturing, ethnicity."
6061,这种组织方式更接近民族志的探索策略，但事实表明读者不太好把握。,"That organization, although close to the ethnographic discovery strategy, proved unwieldy for readers."
6061,在现在的稿子中，我颠倒了等级强调：每-部分集中讨论一种写作策略，但我保留了按民族划分的做法，因为在族群的特定经验和他们获取、提示和运用这些经验的技术之间的确存在某种联系。,"In the present draft, I have reversed th e hierarchical stress: each section focuses on a writing tactic, yet I retain the division by ethnicity because there does seem to be some connection between particular experiences of ethnic groups a nd the techniques used to capture, reveal, or exorcise those experiences."
6062,口头艺术包括叙事、戏剧、诗歌、咒语、谚语、谜语和文字游戏，甚至还有取名的程序、赞美和侮辱——只要它们具有特定的结构形式。,"The verbal arts include narratives, dramas, poetry, incantations, proverbs, riddles, word games, and even naming procedures, compliments, and insults, when these take structured and special forms."
6062,叙事似乎是最容易记录和 搜集的一种口头艺术。,Narratives seem to be one of the easiest kinds of verbal arts to record or collect.
6062,也许因为它们也是最适于公开发行的一种口头艺术而且在北美文化中最受欢迎，所以它们得到大量研究和关注。,"Perhaps because they also are the most publishable, with popular appeal in North American culture, they have received the most study and attention."
6062,一般而言，叙事分为三个基 本的、一再出现的类别：神话、传奇和故事。,"Generally, narratives have been divided into three basic and recurring categories: myth, legend, and tale."
6063,拉迪斯拉夫˙霍利和米兰˙斯达克利科（Ladislav Holy and Milan Stuchlik 1983，p.,"Ladislav Holy and Milan Stuchlik (1983, p. 13) do not agree."
6063,13)却不赞 同，他们宁愿认为，从夫居的规则确实是存在的，因为萨米人自己说，女人应该加人男人的群体，即使这个规则常被违背。,"They argue, rather, that the rule of virilocality definitely exists, since the Sami themselves say that the woman ought to join the man’s group, even if the rule is often violated."
6063,显然这是一种正确观点。,This is obviously a valid point.
6063,在很多社会，性不忠很普遍，即使身在其中的大多数人也会同意有一个规则，其大意是这种行为从道德上是令人讨厌的。,"In many societies, sexual infidelity is quite widespread, even if most of the persons in question would agree that there is a rule to the effect that such a practice is morally objectionable."
