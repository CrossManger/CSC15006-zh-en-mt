6064,在一个强调群体对于个体的重要性，并且人们几乎不惜一切代价避免丢面子的社会中，这样的方法可能很有效，但并非所有冲突都可以避免。,"Effective though such techniques may be in societies that stress the importance of the group over the individual, and where loss of face is to be avoided at almost any cost, not all conflict is avoided."
6064,当试图挽回和谐的所有其他方法都失败了，同胞兄弟姐妹们也许就不得不要求分家析产。以便各自独立门户，这样，新家庭就诞生了。,"When all else fails to restore harmony, siblings may be forced to demand their share of family assets to set up separate households, and in this way new families arise."
6064,离婚也是可能的，尽管在不同的社会中离婚的难易程度有相当大的不同。,"Divorce, too, may be possible, although how easily this may be accomplished varies considerably from one society to another."
6064,在实行从母居的社会中，离婚率一般比较高，这反映出人们能够很容易地终止自己不满意的婚姻。,"In societies that practice matrilocal residence, divorce rates tend to be high, reflecting how easily unsatisfactory marriages can be terminated."
6065,影响存在的瞬间的重要性的是它们被感知的强度；还有就是经历带来的出乎意料。,What makes moments of being more or less significant is their felt intensity; also their unexpectedness as experiences.
6065,"与那些把它们并置或概括它们的瞬间相比,这些因素在存在的瞬间中发生得更多。","In comparison with the moments which juxtapose or encapsulate them, far more has happened within them."
6065,这就是，费尔南德斯（Fernandez 1986：xi）所说的，“突然具有了一系列重要意义的瞬间”变成了“启示性的事件”。,"Here are, in Fernandez's words (1986: xi), ""moments of a sudden constellation of significances"" which become ""'revelatory incidents'""."
6066,代码也必须携带信息，这些信息是否含蓄，取决于它们所含信息的种类、对象和随后的加工过程。,"Codes must also carry information, however implicitly, concerning what kind of information they contain, who it is for, and what is to be done with it."
6066,信息不仅仅涉及外部事件，而且处于代码系统中的这些信息也会传递关于系统本身及其使用者的讯息。,"Besides information about external events, therefore, the messages in a codification system also convey information about thesystem itself and those who are using it."
6066,因此，讯息不仅交换信息，而且是交流的交流，或者说是“元信息传递”（Bateson 1951: 209）。,"Hence, not only do the messages communicate information, they are also communications about communication, or ‘metacommunications’ (Bateson 1951:209)."
6067,尽管有点失望，但我还是尊重我朋友说的理由，焦急地等待下一个合适人选。,
6067,这也是我朋友社交倶乐部一个女子的女儿。我朋友对这一家明显有兴趣，我可以看出理由。该家族声望显赫；事实上，他们来自稍髙于我朋友家的一个种姓分支。姑娘是独养女儿，相貌标致，受过良好教會，有一个兄弟在美国留学。,"Somewhat disappointed, I nevertheless respected my friend's reasoning and geared up for the next prospect This was also ""the daughter of a woman in my friend's social club.There was clear interest in this family and I could see why.The family's reputation was excellent; in fact, they came from a sub-caste slightly higher than my friend’s own.The girl, who was an only daughter, was pretty and well educated and had a brother studying in the United States."
6067,"然而，在向我表达了对这一家的兴趣后,突然不再提起了它了，又开始在其他地方寻觅。","Yet, after expressing an interest to me in this family, all talk of them suddenly died down and the search began elsewhere."
6068,我们应该注意到，这种社会流动性并没有就这样挑战了种姓等级制度：相反，它公开地支持了它。,"This kind of social mobility, we should note, does not challenge the caste hierarchy as such: rather, it openly endorses it."
6068,这种政治冲突是所谓的种姓冲突，它是一种不同的类型。,The type of political conflict spoken of as caste conflict is of a different kind.
6068,潘（Pan）这个种姓是低级的、仪式上肮脏的和贫穷的种姓，其首领被甘地的种姓平等的观念所激励。,"The Pan caste was a lowly, ritually polluting and poor caste whose leaders were inspired by Gandhi's notions of caste equality."
6068,在一些场合，他们试图进入只为高级种姓服务的庙宇，但却被驱逐出来。,"On several occasions they had tried to enter a temple reserved for the high castes, but had been evicted."
6068,于是他们建造了自己的庙宇，并宣布他们自己是一个干净的种姓。,They then built their own temple and declared themselves a clean caste.
6068,这个策略并没有被比斯帕拉的其他种姓所接受，他们将其看成是对规则的公然违背，而这无助于提高潘这个种姓被社会所定义的等级。,"This strategy was not accepted by the other castes in Bisipara, who saw it at a blatant breach of rules, and it did not help in improving the socially defined rank of the Pan caste."
6069,另一个主要观点，深受列宁（Lenin）和托洛茨基（Trotsky）对帝国主义的分析的影响，他们强调了富裕国家对贫穷国家的剥削，而且两者的经济和政治的接触不会导致后者的“发展”，相反，而是导致它们激烈的欠发达状态。,"The other main view, which is influenced by Lenin's and Trotsky's analyses of imperialism, instead emphasises the ways in which the rich countries exploit the poor ones and that economic and political contact does not lead to the ""development"" of the latter, but instead to their active underdevelopment."
6069,巨大的国家债务、贫穷国家售出商品（多数是原材料）的低廉价格、跨国公司对利润的榨取都是这种结构不平等的症状（例如，参见Frank 1979）。,"Large state debts, low prices put on the goods the poor countries sell (mostly raw materials) and the extraction of profits by multinational companies are symptoms of this situation of structural inequality (see for instance Frank 1979)."
6069,因此，战后几十年的去殖民化并没有为贫穷国家带来真正的独立和解放，因为它们被牢固地绑缚在他们注定会输掉的资本主义体系之中。,"Thus the de-colonisation of the post-war decades did not lead to the true independence and emancipation of poor countries, since they were tied up with a global capitalist system in which they were bound to lose out."
6070,事实上，依附训练与独立训练是一个统一体的两个极端，特殊处境可以分享二者的各种要素。,"In actuality, dependence and independence training represent extremes along a continuum, and actual situations may partake of elements of both."
6070,例如，在寻食社会中，儿童养育实践结合二者的各种要素。,"In food-foraging societies, for example, child-rearing practices combine elements of both."
6070,"“分享一切”是日常的秩序,因此竞争行为被劝阻，因为它可能与所有其他人所依赖的合作相抵触。","""Share and share alike is the order of the day, so competitive behavior, which can interfere with the cooperation all else depends on, is discouraged."
6070,由此，婴儿从成人那里获得许多积极的、充满深情的照料，同时得到长期的口头满足。,"Thus, infants receive much positive, affectionate attention from adults, along with prolonged oral gratification."
6070,这种情况，以及由于顺从的较低压力和不太强调竞争，与在现代工业和后工业社会中经常出现的情况相比，鼓励个人有更多的相互支持和帮助。,"This, as well as low pressure for compliance and a lack of emphasis on competition, encourages individuals to be more supportive of one another than is often the case in modern industrial societies."
6071,从一开始，这位历史学家的天真的语调就是我们踌躇的理由。,From the outset the historian's innocent tone gives reason to pause.
6071,他的资料(“农民本身的直接证言”）何以能够保持不受权力支配语境(“宗教裁判记录”)的污染？,"How can his data (""the direct testimony of the peasants themselves"") have remained untainted by the context of domination (""the Inquisition Register"")?"
6071,毕竟，审讯者是从他们的证言中提取他们的所谓坦白，而确实不是作为日常生活中的对话而碰巧听到这些被认为是坦白的内容。,"After all, the inquisitor extracted the testimonies as confessions; he did not overhear them as conversations in everyday life."
6071,究竟是什么可以使历史学家有动机把资料与这些资料得以捜集的手段区分开来呢？,What could motivate the historian to separate the data from the instrument through which they were collected?
6072,和功能主义方法不同的是，列维-斯特劳斯结构主义分析的问题在于，神话和神话的含义被从日常生活中剥离出来。,"In contrast to the functionalist approach, the major problem in Lévi-Straussian structural analysis is that myth and its meaning become decontextualized from everyday life."
6072,现实手段中的神话变成了一个单独的科学专门知识的话题。,What myth in reality means becomes a topic for scientific specialist knowledge alone.
6072,神话中表述性的角色和对话被忽略掉了，包括神话那些与社会价值、政治、生活影响力、以及（当地人的）心理状态有关的方面也被忽略了。,"The performative role and dialogics of myth narration are neglected, as are its aspects that pertain to social value, the political, the life of affect, and the (indigenous) philosophical."
6072,列维-斯特劳斯这种独特的科学研究方法，使得真理等同于物理学家对物质现实设定的原理。,"Because of Lévi-Strauss’s particular scientific project, truth equates with the physical scientist’s postulates of material reality."
6072,它重新界定了认知的客观性，而不是讲演、情感、或者价值观念的客观性，这些他认为超出了科学分析的范围（Levi-Strauss 1981）；与奥弗林（Overing 1985a）和里维特（Leavitt 1996）的观点形成对比。,"It also recognizes the objective reality of cognition, but not of speech, the emotions, or the world of values, which he states to be beyond the ken of scientific analysis (Lévi-Strauss 1981); contrast Overing 1985a; Leavitt 1996."
6073,从更普遍的意义上说，瓦尼特村中或村外共同使用的行为方式，可以说是具有多重分类体系，而不是单一的或者相同称谓的类別。,"More generally, the forms of behaviour in common use in Wanet village and beyond could be said to amount to polythetic categories rather than anything singular or common denominational."
6073,虽然人们日常在现场可以采用许多行为形式，甚至认为其中某些对自己有特殊意义，但是并不存在一个统一的标准可以决定这些形式的含义。,While there are many forms of behaviour which people routinely employ in the locale—even regard as special to them in the locale—there are no standard definitions of what these forms mean.
6073,更恰当的说法是，运用是个体性的，与特定的关系有关，并且在特定的关系中进行表述。,"Rather, usage is individual, and connected to and expressed within particular relationships."
6074,要界定这两个群体，以“少数”对“多数”来理解可能会相称一些。,"To speak in terms of ""minority"" versus ""majority"" implies some symmetry in what defines both groups."
6074,如果我们诉诸西欧的“多元文化主义”，这种对称性就不存在，也不可能存在。,"This symmetry does not exist, and cannot exist if we refer to ""multiculturalism"" in Western Europe."
6074,当谈到原生的和外来的身份时，绝对不可能用同样的知识工具，这不仅仅是因为各种文化之间关系的难点多变，还因为“文化”属性在移民的过程中经历着深刻的变化。,"One definitively cannot use the same intellectual tools when speaking of pristine identities and imported identities, not only because the problematic of relations between various cultures changes, but also because the very nature of the ""cultures"" undergoes a deep evolution in the immigration process"
6075,回顾诸如此类的研究，很清楚，人格、儿童养育习俗与文化的其他各个方面有着必然的相互关系。,"From studies such as those reviewed here, it is clear that personality, child-rearing practices, and other aspects of culture are interrelated in a nonrandom way."
6075,怀廷和柴尔徳认为，一个社会的儿童养育习俗的根源在于有关食物、居处和防卫的基本习惯，而一个社会的儿童养育习俗反过来造就特定类型的成人人格。,"Whiting and Child argued that the child-rearing practices of a society originate in bassic customs surrounding nourishment, shelter, and protection and that these child-rearing practices in turn produce particular kinds of adult personalities."
6075,困难在于，这种相关并不证明原因和结果。,The trouble is that correlations do not prove cause and effect.
6075,"我们还是要面对这一客观事实，即不管它看起来多么合乎逻辑,这种因果链仍是未加证明的假设。","We still are left with the fact, however logical it may seem, such a causal chain remains an unproven hypothesis."
6076,这些二分法的一个潜在的假设观点是：认为现代工业社会是独特的，并且在其他所有社会中是杰出的，通过比较，它被描写为“或多或少是同样的”。,"An underlying assumption of this kind of dichotomy is the view that modern industrial society is unique and stands out in relation to all other societies, which, by comparison, are depicted as ""more or less the same""."
6076,显然，这些二分法作为描写工具是不充分的。,"Obviously, these dichotomies are inadequate as descriptive devices."
6076,首先，传统社会不是“都一样”的——古老的印度王国和北非的乡村社会实际上只有很少共同点。,"First, traditional societies are not ""all the same"" – the ancient kingdoms of India and pastoral societies of North Africa indeed have little in common."
6076,其次，对于现代社会来说，也是如此。,"Second, this holds for modern societies as well."
6076,比如，日本、美国和法国之间就有着重要的差异。,"There are important differences between, say, Japan, the United States and France."
6077,如果这一思考模式的确具有普遍性，会出现什么情况呢？,"If such patterns of thought are indeed universal, why might that be?"
6077,一些人可能会认为，人脑的结构，它的左右半球，应该对引起这一两重性和其他泛人类的思考模式负责。,"Some would suggest that the structure of the human brain, with its left and right hemispheres, is responsible for generating this dualism and other panhuman pattern of thought."
6077,不管答案可能是什么，有一种含义却是可以看得很清楚的。,"What ever the answer, one implication is clear."
6077,与深受现代英美传统影响的多数社会科学家欢迎的这一对人类行为的解释相对比，普遍主义者更倾向于另一种观点。,"In contrast to the kind of explanation of human behavior favored by most social scientists of the modern Anglo-American tradition, universalists would favor another viewpoint."
6078,埃德蒙•利奇爵士是个行为古怪的知识分子，他最终成为核心人物，并激励着他那个时代年轻的人类学家。,Sir Edmund Leach was an intellectual eccentric who eventually became both an establishment figure and an inspiration to young anthropologists of his day.
6078,在接受工程师培养之后，利奇追随雷蒙德•弗思爵士学习，并先后在斯里兰卡（Leach 1961a)、缅甸（例如Leach 1954)及其他地区做田野调查。,"After training as an engineer, he studied under Sir Raymond Firth and did fieldwork in Sri Lanka (Leach 1961a), Burma (e.g., 1954), and elsewhere."
6078,人们通常认为，他是最早转而攻击功能主义的英国人类学家之一，并将法国结构主义介绍给英国人类学界。,He is usually thought of as one who turned against functionalism at an early date and introduced French structuralism into British anthropology.
6079,弗思和（他的老师）马林诺夫斯基似乎在模仿中世纪学者的综合性论文（summa），一种根植于作者自身的、高度结构化和整合性的描述，在这种描述中，“自我”不被视为一个单一的科学观察者，而是进行参与和观察，并从多方位和不断变化的立场进行书写的多面统一体。,"What Firth and Malinowski (his teacher) seem to be after is a kind of summa, a highly textured, totalizing picture anchored in themselves, where ""self"" is understood not as a monolithic scientist-observer, but as a multifaceted entity who participates, observes, and writes from multiple, constantly shifting positions."
6079,这个多才多艺的传奇式主体具有这么强的反思能力，因而能够吸收和传达整个文化的丰富性。,"Such are the reflective capacities of this versatile, larger-than-life subject that it can absorb and transmit the richness of a whole culture."
6079,弗思和马林诺夫斯基关于他们的民族志事业所传达的那种固执的乐观主义也扎根于这一主体中。,In this subject is also anchored the heady optimism both Firth and Malinowski convey about the ethnographic enterprise.
6079,在这些“科学民族志”（马林诺夫斯基是如此对其命名的）创始人的著作中，言说的主体其实根本不是那个消泯了自我的、被动的科学话语主体，这一事实是个极大的反讽。,"There is a significant irony in the fact that the speaking subject in the work of these founders of ""scientific ethnography,"" as Malinowski called it, is anything but the self-effaced, passive subject of scientific discourse."
6080,另一方面，奥本海默（Oppenheimer 1989）把讽刺意识归于特定的文学形式。,"Oppenheimer (1989), meanwhile, attaches an ironic consciousness to certain literary forms."
6080,反讽出现在苏格拉底的对话中，然后也出现于古罗马时期的诗歌中，可是后来在长达七个世纪的中世纪黑暗时代（the Dark Ages）中，它消失了。,"Irony was present in Socratic dialogue, then, and also in the poetics of Classical Rome but thereafter, through some seven centuries of the Dark Ages, it disappeared."
6080,只是随着12世纪罗马的十四行诗的兴起，反讽才逐渐得以复兴。,
6080,,Only with the rise of the sonnet in a twelfth-century Rome was there an ironic renaissance.
6081,当维克多·特纳借用韦伯关于惯例和卡里斯玛（charisma）之间的辩证关系来阐述一个普遍的结构与反结构的理论，其实在本质上也是涉及同一个矛盾。,"While Victor Turner’s adaptation of the Weberian dialectic of routine versus charisma into a universalizing theory of structure versus anti-structure, turned, essentially, on the same tension."
6081,特纳说，象征性的行为建构起社会，社会作为一个过程包含各个方面的结构和反结构。,"Symbolic behaviour constituted society, Turner elaborated, and society as a process involved the uniting of structure and anti-structure in variable proportions."
6081,"而且反结构要优先于结构，更具有创造性，结构则同时保持对称性并且会卷入到不断捍卫个体真正的忠诚的斗争中（1974: 231-69,1982a: 96-129）。","Moreover, it was the anti-structural which was prior to and creative of the structural, while remaining antithetical in character and embroiled in a continual struggle for individuals’ true loyalty (1974:231–69, 1982a:96–129)."
6082,在群体内发生的交换一般采取泛化互惠或平衡互惠的形当交换在两个群体之间进行时，就可能有敌对和竞争的倾向。,"Exchanges that occur within a group of people gen­erally take the form of generalized or balanced rec­iprocity.When they occur between two groups, at least a potential for hostility and competition is apt to exist."
6082,因此，这类交换可能采取消极互惠的形式，除非人们做好某种安排，确保交换大致接近于平衡。,"Therefore, such exchanges may well take the form of negative reciprocity, unless some sort of arrangement has been made to ensure at least an approach to balance."
6082,物物交换是消极互惠的一种形式，通过这种交换，一个群体的稀缺物品与另一个群体的合意物品相交换。,"Barter is one form of negative reciprocity, involving the exchange of scarce items from one group for desirable goods from another group."
6082,交换时要计算相对价值，尽管双方外表上满不在乎，与一个群体内部交换更加平衡的性质相比，精明的交易更是惯例。,"Relative value is calculated, and despite an outward show of indifference, sharp trading is more the rule, when compared to the more balanced nature of exchanges within a group."
6083,这些灵魂比男神和女神更接近人类，并且更加关注人类的活动。,These spirit beings are closer to humans than gods and goddesses and are intimately concerned with human activities.
6083,泛灵信仰在那些把自己视为自然一部分而非高于自然的民族中，是很常见的。,Animism is typical of peoples who see themselves as a part of nature rather than as superior to it.
6083,对袓先之灵的信仰基于这样一种观念：人是由身体和灵魂组成的。,A belief in ancestral spirits is based on the idea that human beings are made up of a body and soul.
6083,人死的时候，灵魂脱离了肉体，并继续参与人间的事务。,At death the spirit is freed from the body and continues to participate in human affairs.
6083,在那些以继嗣为基础，并以祖先为取向的群体中，对袓先之灵的信仰特别常见泛生信仰与泛灵信仰可能在同一种文化中存在。,Belief in ancestral spirits is particularly characteristic of descent- based groups with their associated ancestral orientation.Animatism may be found with animism in the same culture.
6083,泛生信仰是指向成功结果的力或力量，这种力量可以体现在任何物体之中。,Animatism is a force or power directed to a successful outcome and may make itself manifest in any object.
6084,上述洞察可以大致总结为“方法论的个体上义”。,"The above insights may be pulled together under the approximate title of ""methodological individualism""."
6084,就像波普尔 (Popper 1966:91—8)主张的，这种解释避免了对集体术语（从“时代思潮”到“国家”、“民族”、“社会群体”、“制度结构”、“利益分割”或“劳动”，或“权力的不对称”）的滥用，而更偏爱描述性的、个体主义的术语。,"Here, as Popper advocates (1966:91–8), is explanation which avoids a vulgar use of collective, impersonal terms (from ""Zeitgeist"" to ""state"", ""nation"", ""social group"", ""institutional structure"", ""division of interest"" or ""labour"", or ""asymmetry of power"") in favour of explanation in more descriptive, individualistic terms."
6084,这并不否认阶级、性別、角色和地位等观念的针对性，而是说这些观念的意义和效果必须来自它们被建构进互动情景的方式，正是互动个体对这些观念的应用为他们建构了社会生活——这些应用远不是强制的、均匀的或统一的（参见：Blumer 1972: 185—7)。,"This does not deny the pertinence of notions of class or gender, role or status etc., but says that the meaning and effect of these latter must be derived from how they are constructed in situations of interaction.For it is use of these notions by interacting individuals which affords them social life—use which may be very far from consensual, homogeneous or uniform (cf. Blumer 1972:185–7)."
6085,不幸的是，在上中层阶级白人和黑人中有一种普遍的感觉:这种方言在某种程度上是不够标准或有缺陷的，它不是标准语言。,"Unfortunately, a widespread perception among upper- and middle-class Whites and Blacks alike is that this dialect is somehow substandard or defective, which it is not."
6085,语言学的基本原则是，对有声望的方言加以选择——既然如此，我们可以称“标准英语”是与“黑人语”相对的——是由偶然的语言外的力量决定的，而且不取决于方言本身的间接功效。,"A basic principle of linguistics is that the selection of a prestige dialect in this case, what we may call Standard English as opposed to Ebonics—is determined by accidental extralinguistic forces and is not dependent on indirect virtues of the dialects themselves."
6085,事实上，“美国黑人方言英语”是具有高级结构的语言模式，能够表达说该语言的人想要表达的任何东四，（如在“闲聊”中）经常以极富创造性的方式表达事情。,"In fact, African American Vernacular English is a highly structured mode of speech, capable of expressing anything its speakers care to express, often in extremely creative ways (as in ""rapping"")."
6086,这种类型学有意义吗？,Do typologies of this kind make sense?
6086,它们当然过于简单化，而且如今留下的“纯粹的”形式已经很少了。,"They are certainly simplistic, and today there are scarcely any ""pure"" forms left."
6086,但是，这样一种细目分类却有助于提供一份理想模型的清单，可以揭示生产科技、生存模式、社会和文化的其他方面之间的相互关系。,"However, such a breakdown may nonetheless be useful in providing a list of ideal types which reveals the interrelationship between production technology, mode of subsistence and other aspects of culture and society."
6086,后面的几章将讨论口头和书写宗教之间、机械的和“具体的”时间之间，以及不同的思维模式之间的关系。,"Later chapters discuss the relationship between oral and written religions, between mechanical and ""concrete"" time and between different modes of thought."
6086,如果大家一致同意人类学出现在工业社会而不是放牧者之类的其他社会中不完全是一种偶然的话，我们就需要在不同类型的社会之间做出明确区分，从而理解人类的多样性是如何通过各种不同但并非毫无关联的方式进行自我表达的。,"If it can be agreed that it was not a complete coincidence that anthropology emerged in industrial society and not in a pastoralist society, for example, we need to make clear distinctions between kinds of societies to understand how the diversity of humanity expresses itself in different, but not unconnected ways."
6087,对非预期结果的设定是一种手段。由此，民族志作者就能将分析推进到超越起初田野工作的地点之外，用文化的、在结构上相应的术语对宏大体系（传统上被认为是柚象结构）进行再现。,"The postulate of unintended consequences is a means by which an ethnographer can push analysis beyond the locale of primary fieldwork to representations of the macro-system (conventionally conceived as abstract structures) in cultural, structurally contingent terms."
6087,威利斯充分运用了这一策略，诺尔-塞蒂娜将这一策略视为（第213页见脚注①）将宏观视角带回到微观视角下的、生产力主导一切的当前状况的一种模式。,"Willis makes full use of this move, which Knorr-Cetina discusses (see footnote 6) as one of the modes of bringing macro perspectives back into the current reign of productivity in micro perspectives."
6087,实际上《学会劳动》的主旨就在于讨论那些小伙子在学校形成的对抗文化的非预期结果：作为学校里阶级冲突的讽刺性结果，他们如何系统地使自己丧失获得中产阶级工作的资格；在不存在强制的情况下，年轻人如何将自己埋葬在工场车间。,"In fact, the central argument of the book is the one about the unintended consequences of the lads' oppositional culture formed at school: how they systematically disqualify themselves from middle class jobs as the ironic effect of class conflict in the schools; how, without coercion, youths funnel themselves onto the shop floor."
6088,纳米比亚人类学家罗伯特˙戈登以下述方式说到这一点：“社会学家或政治学家可能就花瓣而考察花朵的花瓣之美，而人类学家则站在山顶上，俯视田野之美。换言之，我们尝试并赞成较宽广的视角。”当民族志学家参与不熟悉的文化时，不是盲目地瞎闯，而是谋取个别知情人任何活动。,"Robert Gordon, an anthropologist from Namibia, speaks of it in this way: ""Whereas the sociologist or the political scientist might examine the beauty of a flower petal by petal, the anthropologist is the person that stands on the top of the mountain and looks at the beauty of the field. In other words, we try and go for the wider perspective.""  When participating in unfamiliar cultures, ethnographers do not just blunder about blindly but enlist the assistance of individual informants."
6088,就如儿童从其父母那里学会正确行为那样，知情人有助于人类学家在田野中理解先前陌生文化中的“奥秘”。,"These are members of the society the anthropologist as ethnographer is working in, who she or he develops close relationships with and who help interpret whatever activities are occurring.As a child learns proper behavior from its parents, so do informants help the anthropologist in the field unravel the ""mysteries"" of what is, at first, a strange culture."
6089,在复杂的外部环境下，许多民主危机更加恶化了，新国家中的经济问题受大萧条的影响更严重了，如匈牙利极度的通货膨胀。20世纪30年代晚期，只剩捷克还是民主的国家。,"Many of the crises of democracy were made worse by difficult external circumstances.Economic problems in the new states, leading for example to hyperinflation in Hungary, were exacerbated by the effects of the depression.By the late 1930s, only Czechoslovakia remained democratic."
6089,20世纪60年代之后，许多殖民时代之后的国家都出现了类似的问题即指望非殖民化能带来新的民主秩序，但这往往会令人失望。,Comparable problems arose in many post-colonial states from the 1960s onwards.Hopes that decolonisation would lead to a new democratic order were often disappointed.
6090,几年之内，整形外科在富裕的西方社会变得非常流行，常被看做是改变身份的企图，而人们通常认为身份和性别（也就是年龄）一样至关重要和绝对。和性别一样，对于社会分层和分类来说，年龄也是一个普遍准则。,"Plastic surgery, which in the space of a few years has become very widespread in the affluent Western societies, can frequently be seen as an attempt to change an identity which is usually perceived as no less imperative and absolute than gender, namely age.Like gender, age is a universal principle for social differentiation and classification."
6090,年龄是一个无法避免和无法逆转的生物过程，但是，和性别一样，在某种程度上，年龄也是由社会建构的。,"Ageing is an inevitable and irreversible biological process but, like gender, age is to some extent socially constructed."
6090,在许多社会，不论是什么性别，人老了以后，他或她的等级就上升了。,"In many societies a perso's rank rises as he or she becomes older, regardless of gender."
6091,分类就是把人、事物、概念、关系、力量等划分到不同类别中；人可能是所有生物中最独特的一个，把自己的分类体系施加在环境中的物质现实上，并且依赖这种认知过程所产生的稳定环境进行生活。,"Classification is the activity of assigning people, things, concepts, relationships, forces and so on, to different categories; human beings are perhaps unique among animals for the extent to which they manipulate the physical realities of their environs in terms of the categories they impose upon them—and for the extent to which they depend upon such creative cognitive manipulations for the procuring of a stable environment in which to live."
6091,分类对我们人类思考和认识这个世界、了解自己的生活空间以及其中的活动来说至关重要。,"Classification is essential to our human ability to think about and know the world, and to think about and know our own place and that of our activities within it."
6091,我们将世界进行分类，既会赋予我们力量去行动和认知，同时也会限制我们，因为我们所能知道的、参与的、认知的、想要的、承认是有序的以及为之奋斗的，都由我们所采用的分类框架预先设定了。,"At the same time as our classifying the world empowers us to act and to know, however, it also limits us, because what we can know, what we anticipate, and recognize, and intend, and regard as orderly and work towards, are all in a way pre-given by classificatory schemata which we are employing."
6092,但是追溯欧洲的非殖民化进程，就可以看到，只有一部分分离主义运动获得了成功，从而建立起新的国家，新加坡、孟加拉和厄立特里亚就是其代表。,"Following European decolonisation, only a few such secessionist movements have managed to create new states: Singapore, Bangladesh and Eritrea are leading examples."
6092,实际上，分离常常遭到强烈反对。,
6092,,There is a strong presumption against secession.
6092,非洲国家的政府反对改变殖民时代之后关于国家和边界的安排，尽管这些都是人为的东西，但它们害怕允许分离会开不稳定的先河。,"African governments have been opposed to changes in their post-colonial arrangement of states and frontiers, however artificial these may be, because they understandably fear that permitting secession would set a destabilising precedent."
6093,全球化作为进化论者和后现代人类学家共同提出的主题，人类学家无论在田野调查和参加会议时都会遇到。它已经成为一个普遍而及时的关注点。,"As a theme promoted by both evolutionist and postmodernist anthropology as well as a topic visible to anthropologists whenever they do fieldwork or even attend conferences, globalization is a popular and timely concern."
6093,具有讽刺意味的是，在理论术语中它或许很容易会被视为与最落伍的理论观点传播论相等同。,"The irony is that in theoretical terms it might as easily be seen as most akin to the least trendy of all theoretical perspectives, diffusionism."
6094,然而，在妇女做大量生产性工作的社会中，一夫多妻制可作为一种手段，为家户增添财富。,"Yet in societies where women do most of the productive work, polygyny may serve as a means of generating wealth for a household."
6094,尽管在特定社会极少数婚姻是一夫多妻的，但人们也认为它是恰当的婚姻形式，在世界大多数社会，它甚至还是人们优先选择的婚姻形式。,"Although few marriages in a given society may be polygynous, it is regarded as an appropriate, and even preferred, form of marriage in the majority of the world's societies."
6094,因为有剩余男子的社区不多，所以一妻多夫制，即妇女有几个丈夫的习俗是不常见的。,"Since few communities have a surplus of men, polyandry, or the custom of a woman having several husbands, is uncommon."
6094,几个男人与几个女人相互有性接触权的群婚也是罕见的。,"Also rare is group marriage, in which several men and several women have sexual access to one another."
6094,夫兄弟婚通过规定寡妇与她已故丈夫的兄弟结婚来为妇女提供保障，妻姐妹婚规定鳏夫与他已故妻子的姐妹结婚。,The levirate ensures the security of a woman by providing that a widow marry her husband's brother; the sororate provides that a widower marry his wife's sister.
6095,后一半青春的转型平行于前一半；在西班牙镇咖啡馆消磨时光，“第一个成长（13）的巢”（13 =大麻），吸气体麻醉剂，喝磨香葡萄酒.被警察塞壬中的哭夫人追赶，涂鸦（花衣墨西哥“未来艺术家”）。,"The second half parallels the first in the transformations of youth: hanging out at Spanish Town Cafe, the ""first grown - up (13) hangoul "" (13 = marijuana), sniffing gas, drinking muscatel, chased by the llorona of police sirens, paintin g graffiti (pachuco ""could-be artists"")."
6095,西班牙街区已经不在了，但“你仍然活着，我心灵中孤独的单人囚室的俘虏”。,"The barrio is gone , but ""You live on, captive in the lonely cell blocks of my mind."""
6095,献给克利弗的这首诗一个一个提到美国的奇卡诺区的名字。,"The poem, dedicated to Cleaver, names Chicano barrios across the States."
6095,诗的描述是有力的控，但诗歌带来的是力量：“你使我远离癫狂的饥饿的嘴”，提供了“身份……归属感”，这“对于成年时监禁的日子如此关键',"The poem's description is a powerful indictment, but the poem's result is strength: ""you keep me away from INSANITY'S hungry jaws,"" providing ""identity...a sense of belonging,"" which is ""so essential to adult days of imprisonment."""
6096,要强调社会或文化的一统，就会忽略多样性；要强调稳定性，就会忽略变动。,To emphasize the unity of the society or the culture is to ignore the diversity; to emphasize constancy is to ignore change.
6096,为了简化或概括主要特征，强调这些重点是有必要的，但是人类学家已经发现，与此同时也很有必要增加其他方法，以更好地应对多样性和变动性。,"These characteristic emphases are necessary in order to simplify and summarize major features, but anthropologists have found it necessary to add other approaches better able to cope with diversity and change."
6096,其中一种这样的方法就是源出于功能主义的个案研究，另一种方法则是源出于结构主义的符号分析。,"One such approach is the case study method, growing out of functionalism, and the other, symbolic analysis, growing out of configurationalism."
6097,句法涉及一些原则，短语和句子根据这些原则构成。,Syntax refers to the principles phrases and sentences are built with.
6097,语言的完整形式结构构成语言的语法，它由关于语言的词素和句法的所有观察资料组成。,"The entire formal structure of a language, consisting of all observations about its morphemes and syntax, constitutes its grammar."
6097,人类语言根植于我们从灵长目动物祖先继承来的姿势一呼叫系统。姿势一呼叫系统起到“为”言语“定基调”的作用，为解释语言形式提供合适的框架。,"Human language is embedded in a gesture-call system inherited from our primate ancestors that serves to ""key"" speech, providing the appropriate frame for interpreting linguistic form."
6097,这一系统的姿势成分由用来传递信息的身体运动组成；把这些身体运动做成标记并记录下来的系统叫作声势学。,The gestural component of this system consists of body motions used to convey messages; the system of notating and recording these motions is known as kinesics.
6097,辅助语言代表呼叫成分，它是由包括各种各样音质和发嗓音的语言外声音构成的。,"The call component is represented by paralanguage, consisting of extralinguistic noises involving various voice qualities and vocalizations."
6098,妇女当家的单亲家户既非新事物，也非限于诸如美国那样的工业社会。,Single-parent households headed by women are neither new nor restricted to industrialized societies such as the United States.
6098,在加勒比海国家中，它们广为人知，而且长期以来一直为人们所研究。在那里，男子向来被当作种植园的廉价劳动力加以剥削。,"They have been known and studied for a long time in the countries of the Caribbean basin, where men historically have been exploited as a cheap source of labor on plantations."
6098,在这种条件之下，男子没有权力，薪资微薄。因此，他们充其量若即若离地附属于某一特定的家户。,"Under such conditions, men have no power and few economic rewards; hence they are tenuously attached at best to any particular household."
6098,妇女们把这些因素结合在一起，她们作为维持牛计的食物生产者，为家户提供经济生存的手段。,"These are held together by women, who as producers of subsistence foods provide the means of economic survival for house-holds."
6098,这种类似妇女当家的家户在其他“不发达”国家也变得越来越普遍了，这是因为发展计划不断限制妇女赚取基本生活工资的能力（关于这一点的原因将在第十五章和第十六章加以讨论）。,"Similar female-headed households are becoming increasingly common in other aunderdeveloped countries, too, as development projects increasingly restrict womens ability to earn a living wage (reasons for this are discussed in Chapters 15 and 16)."
6099,另一类概化较少适用于人类的行为而更多适用于人类的思考，更多地受到数学和逻辑而不是自然科学的启发。,Another kind of generalization pertains less to human conduct than to human thought and is inspired more by mathematics and logic than by the natural sciences.
6099,这是一类深受结构主义者喜欢的概化，与其相对的概化则更受进化论者的喜欢。,"This is the sort of generalization favored by the structuralists, in contrast to that favored by the evolutionists."
6099,结构主义考可能无需断言因果联系或功能上的相互联系就可将浩大的民族志事实，概括成少数几条规则或数学公式。,"The structuralist may, without asserting causal connections or functional interrelationships, summarize the vast scope of ethnographic fact as a small number of rules or mathematical formulas."
6100,格栅/群分析法很有趣，它被许多主流人类学之外的社会学家采用。,"Grid/group analysis was an interesting idea, and it remains one for many social scientists outside mainstream anthropology."
6100,但它也是一种还没来得及盛行就已经逝去了的思想（像嬉皮村）。,Yet it may also have been an idea (like hippie communes) whose time had come and gone before it took off.
6100,它保留下来的意义是看看人们是否能在道格拉斯的范式里建立新的研究重点。,It remains to be seen whether some new focus withinher paradigm can be made.
6101,“个体主义”概念超越了我们对我们与社会的联系的认知理解。,The notion of individualism ramifies beyond our perception of our relation to society.
6101,我们已经习惯于将我们自身与自然分开来思考和看待。,We have come to think of ourselves as separate from nature.
6101,我们中的一些人可能会欣赏和喜欢自然——直到我们被困在龙卷风或飓风中，或是被蛇或蜘蛛咬住——但是，现代西方文化总的看法，一直都是将个体与自然对立起来。,"Some of us may admire and enjoy nature – until we are trapped in a tornado or hurricane, or bitten by a snake or spider – but the general tenor of modern Western culture has been to set the individual against nature."
6101,一个人必须与自然奋起抗争，自然是一个危险的敌人——用诗人丁尼生（Tennyson)的话来说就是“一片血淋淋的天地”。,"One must struggle against nature, which is a dangerous enemy–in Tennyson's phrase, ""red in tooth and claw."""
6102,从广义上说，威利斯的主题是，怎样最好地理解资本主义社会中的劳动它是怎样作为文化经验被构建的。,"Willis's subject is, broadly speaking, how best to understand labor in capitalist society — how it is constituted as cultural experience."
6102,就像卡尔˙波拉尼在《大转变》(Polanyi 1944）中所强调的，通过市场规则而将所有人类资源化简为商品，这必然是不完全的和不现实的。,"As Karl Polanyi emphasized in The Great Transformation (1944), the reduction of any human resource to a commodity by market discipline must necessarily be incomplete and a fiction."
6102,需要对各式各样的商品拜物教进行去神秘化，并将劳动理解为一种完全人性的过程。,There is a need to demystify commodity fetishism of various sorts and to understand labor as a fully human process.
6102,对工人阶级的文化研究与社会研究一直是马克思主义传统中自下而上的民族志研究的主要基础，尤其是在英国的马克思主义传统中。,"The cultural and social study of working classes has been the major rationale for bottom-up, ethnographic studies in the Marxist tradition, and particularly in the British Marxist tradition."
6103,现代化进程最好被理解成由四个亚过程组成，其中一个是技术发展。,"The process of modernization may be best understood as consisting of four subprocesses, of which one is technological development."
6103,在现代化的过程中，传统知识和技术让位于主要从工业化的西方借来的科学知识和技术的应用。,"In the course of modernization, traditional knowledge and techniques give way to the application of scientific knowledge and techniques borrowed mainly from the West."
6103,另一个亚过程是农业发展，它意味着农业重点从生存型农业向商品化农业的转变。,"Another subprocess is agricultural development, represented by a shift in emphasis from subsistence farming to commercial farming."
6103,人们不再为自己使用而种植庄稼和饲养牲口了，他们越来越多地转向经济作物的生产，因而也就越来越多地依赖于货帀经济和全球市场来出售农产品和买进商品。,"Instead of raising crops and livestock for their own use, people turn more frequently to the production of cash crops, with greater reliance on a cash economy and on markets for selling farm products and purchasing goods."
6103,第三个亚过程是工业化，它更加强调用物质形式的能量——特别是矿物燃料——来驱动机器。,A third subprocess is industrializationy with a greater emphasis placed on inanimate forms of energy—especially fossil fuels—to power machines.
6104,功能主义和结构主义并不是截然分开的两个思想流派、有着不同的民族志描述的重点。,Functionalism and configurationalism are not so much separate schools of thought as different emphases that guide ethnographicdescription.
6104,英国传统的社会人类学，在展示亲属系统、巫术和魔术、仪式和神话、王位和首领制度运作方式的著作中，强调一种功能主义的描写说明。,"Social anthropology in Britain traditionally has emphasized a functionalist sort of description in masterful monographs that show the workings of kinship systems, of witchcraft and sorcery, ritual and myth, kingship and chieftainship."
6104,美国的文化人类学则稍微更多地强调结构主义方法。,Cultural anthropology in America has emphasized somewhat more the configurationalist approach.
6105,就像前面提到的把社会和文化作为一种自在的实体的那种虚幻的观点一样，共产主义可以说是体现了一种从未存在过的关于精神和行为情形的回顾式的神话。,"As with the aforementioned illusory notions of society and culture as sui generis, communitarianism can be said to represent a backward-looking myth of a situation of cognitive and behavioural commonality that never existed."
6105,在实践中，共产主义往往具有等级性，总是会排除掉那些不归附的人，例如妇女和奴隶、野蛮人、异教徒、犹太人、共产主义者、同性恋者。,"In practice, communitarianism is often hierarchical, and always exclusionary with regard to those who do not belong—women and slaves, savages, pagans, Jews, Communists, homosexuals."
6105,在社会运用过程中，这一思想试图对个体成员的意识实施“殖民”，以便确立一个社会文化群体的中心并确保其完整性（Cohen 1994）。,"In sociological usage, moreover, the ideology represents an attempt to ‘colonize’ the consciousness of individual members so that the latter are pressed into the matrices of perception of socio-cultural groupings and identify withthem completely (cf. Cohen 1994)."
6106,共同利益社团的种类多得令人吃惊。,The diversity of common-interest associations is astonishing.
6106,在美国，它们包栝如此多样的实体：各种各样的女性俱乐部、街头帮派、私人民兵团体、基瓦尼斯倶乐部，扶轮国际“分社”、家长教师联合会、教会和其他宗教组织、政党、工会、环境组织以及像大赦国际那样的人权组织——诸如此类的社团还可以列举出很多。,"In the United States, they include such diverse entities as women's clubs of all sorts，street gangs, private militias, Kiwanis clubs, Rotary clubs, Parent Teacher Associations, religious organizations, political parties, and labor unions—the list could go on and on."
6106,它们的目标可能包括追求友谊、娱乐，宣扬某些价值观念，还有控制、追求或者保卫经济利益。,"Their goals may include the pursuit of friendship, recreation, and promotion of certain values, as well as governing and the pursuit or defense of economic interests."
6106,社团还发挥了保护各种少数民族的歌曲、历史、语言和道德信仰的作用，例如，西非部落联盟就一直在致力于这一目标。,"Associations also serve to preserve traditional songs, history, language, and moral beliefs among various ethnic minorities; the Tribal Unions of West Africa, for example, continue to serve this purpose."
6107,一位富有的世系头人将会为全村举办盛宴，他会因此被认为对神 灵世界拥有更大影响。,A wealthy lineage head would hold feasts for the entire village and thus be seen to have greater influence with the spirit world.
6107,结果，就分裂出这样一个世系，人们认为，通过其祖先这个世系与神灵的关系变得更为“紧密”了。（见图表 6.3)。,"This results in the setting apart of such a lineage, as it comes to be recognized as ‘closer’ to the spirits through its ancestor (as in figure 6.3)."
6107,于是通过环境、经济、亲属和宗教等因素连续的结合，贡老平等制演变为贡萨制。,"Thus the egalitarian gumlao system evolves into a gumsa one through a sequential combination of environmental, economic, kinship, and religious factors."
6108,虽然传统的观点认为，农民是温和的土地耕种者，但正是在这些人中间，再加上畜牧者，战争才变得突出起来——尽管安分守己的农民的确存在。,"Although peaceful farmers exist and despite the traditional view of the farmer as a gentle tiller of the soil, it is among such people, along with pastoralists, warfare becomes prominent."
6108,一个原因可能是：与寻食者相比，食物生产民族的人口增长的可能性要大得多，而前者人口数一般总维持在社会供养能力之内。,"One reason may be that food-producing peoples are far more prone to population growth than are food foragers, whose numbers generally are maintained well below carrying capacity."
6108,这种人口增长如果不加以控制，会导致资源耗竭，对此问题的一个解决办法也许是攫取其他民族的资源。,"This population growth, if unchecked, can lead to resource depletion, one solution to which may be seizure of some other people's resources."
6108,此外，对农耕必需的一块固定土地的忠诚，便得这种社会中成员身份变动比在寻食者社会要小，农民在 当地结婚，而不是远嫁他乡，因此他们没有远距离的亲属关系网。,"In addition, the commitment to a fixed piece of land inherent in farming makes such societies somewhat less fluid in their membership than those of food foragers."
6109,在战后时间，人类学家为和平部队、印第安事务局、世界银行、联合国教科文组织、联合国食品和农产品组织，以及其他机构工作。,"In postwar times, anthropologists have worked for the Peace Corps, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the World Bank, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization, and other agencies."
6109,与过去的殖民地办公室不同，这些机构不是当地社会长期的管理员，而是其技术援助的短期负责人。,"Unlike the colonial offices, these agencies are not long-term administrators of native society but short-term bearers of technical assistance."
6109,人类学家可以帮助将这一援助与当地背景结合到一起。,The anthropologists help marry the assistance to the native context.
6110,尽管如此，到目前为止，自决的想法，尤其是民族自决的想法，还不能说已经寿终正寝了（无论它在军事上胜利与否）。,"Nevertheless, ideas of self-determination in general, or national self-determination in particular, cannot be declared dead and then buried, with or without full military honours."
6110,它已经塑造了我们所生活的世界，解决国家关系中重要而长久存在的问题：国家的形成方式，帝国衰落、分裂的趋势，帝国时代之后的安排，人民掌握政治权力，无国家的人的脆弱感。,"They have shaped the world we inhabit, addressing central and enduring problems of international relations: the ways in which states are formed; the tendency of empires to decline and break up; the nature of post-imperial arrangements; the popular control of political power; and the vulnerability felt by peoples who do not have their own state."
6110,鉴于民族自决原则的缺陷如此之多，因而就很有必要寻找能替代它作为国际秩序之基础的思想。,"However, the flaws of national self-determination as an ordering principle are so numerous that there is a need to explore alternative bases of international order."
6111,,"Concomitant with this trend was the emergence of a special social mechanism of co-ordination of functions and correlation of structures, a mechanism of integration and regulation."
6111,这一政治机构具有两个方面，即世俗方面与宗教方面。这两方面时而密切结合，时而互不相容，但总是共存的。,"This political mechanism had two aspects, secular and ecclesiastic, sometimes closely related, sometimes distinct, but always present."
6111,我们将这一协调、整合和凋节的特殊机构称为国家一教会机构。,"We call this special mechanism of co-ordination, integration and regulation the State-Church."
6111,在从早期的治金吋代直至当代文明社会的进化中，历经了国家与阶级关系的各式形态，这就是我们眼下正要转向的课题。,"The evolution of civil society from the early metallurgical era to the present day, passing through a variety of forms of the state and class relations, is a story that we shall turn to presently."
6111,在这里，我们希望返回到前面接触过的一个论题上去,At this point we wish to return to a matter touched upon earlier.
6112,个人为了从一个地点转向另一个地点，必须知道他们曾在什么地方和将在什么地方。,Individuals must know where they have been and will be to get from one place to another.
6112,他们也需要维持自我连续感，以至于过去的行动与现在和将来的行动联系在一起。,They also need to maintain a sense of self-continuity so that past actions are connected with those in the present and future.
6112,因此，时间定向也是行为环境的一部分。,"Hence, temporal orientation is also part of the behavioral environment."
6112,就如感知到的环境是在文化范围内组织起来的，时间与空间同样如此。,"Just as the perceived environment is organized in cultural terms, so too are time and space."
6112,行为环境的最后方面是规范定向。,A final aspect of the behavioral environment is the normative orientation.
6112,在源头上纯粹是文化的价值、理想和标准，就如树木、河流和山脉一样，是个人行为环境的一部分。,"Values, ideals, and standards, which are purely cultural in origin, are as of an individuals behavioral environment as are trees, rivers, and mountains."
6113,合法性概念，即政治领导人统治的权力概念，也是政治过程的基础。,"Also basic to the political process is the concept of legitimacy, or the right of political leaders to rule."
6113,与暴力一样，合法性是支持政治制度的一种形式；与暴力不同的是，合法性是以特定社会坚持的价值为基础的。,"Like force, legitimacy is a form of support for a political system; unlike force, legitimacy is based on the values a particular society believes most important."
6113,例如，在卡保库人中，托诺维权力的合法性来自他的财富；夏威夷国王以及革命以前的英格兰和法国的国王，据称都拥有进行统治的神圣权力；而非洲西部的达荷美共和国（即现在的贝宁共和国）的首领凭借其年龄获取合法性，因为他总是该国最长寿的男性。,"For example, among the Kapauku the legitimacy of the tonowirs power comes from his wealth; the kings of Hawaii, and of England and France before their revolutions, were thought to have a divine right to rule; and the head of the Dahomey state of West Africa acquires legitimacy through his age, as he is always the oldest living male."
6114,在像因纽特人这样生活环境恶劣的社会中，核心家庭也很盛行。,The nuclear family is also apt to be prominent in societies such as the Inuit that live in harsh environments.
6114,在冬季，因纽特人的丈夫和妻子，连同他们的小孩，在广阔无垠的北极野地上漫游，搜寻食物。,"In the winter the Inuit husband and wife, with their children, roam the vast Arctic wilderness in search of food."
6114,丈夫打猎和建造房屋。,The husband hunts and makes shelters.
6114,妻子烹饪，负责照看孩子，织补衣物。,"The wife cooks, is responsible for the children, and makes the clothing and keeps it in good repair."
6114,她有一份家务活是用牙咬她丈夫的靴子，以使皮革变软，便于他第二天继续打猎。,One of her chores is to chew her husband's boots to soften the leather for the next day so that he can resume his search for game.
6114,没有丈夫，妻子 及其小孩就不能生存，同样，没有妻子，一个男人的生活也是无法想象的。,"The wife and her children could not survive without the husband, and life for a man is unimaginable without a wife."
6115,国民性格研究集中研究现代各国的典型性格。,National character studies have focused on the modal characteristics of modern countries.
6115,因而他们试图确定塑造这种群体人格的儿童养育习俗和教育。,They then have attempted to determine the child-rearing practices and education that shape such a group personality.
6115,第二次世界大战期间的研究者，对外国出生的国民进行访谈并分析其他资料，努力描述国民性格D许多人类学家认为，国民性格理论是以非科学的和过于概括的数据为基础的。,Investigators during World War II interviewed foreign-born nationals and analyzed other sources in an effort to depict national character.Many anthropologists believe national character theories are based on unscientific and over-generalized data.
6115,其他人类学家选择集中研究特定社会提倡的核心价值，同时承认对个人灌输这些核心价值的成功程度可能有相当大的差异。,Others have chosen to focus on the core values promoted in particular societies while recognizing that success in instilling these values in individuals may vary considerably.
6116,奥克兰市最近采纳的关于黑人语的决议引起抗议浪潮，大部分在于两方面的争议问题：（1）有一种误解，以为奥克兰市学校系统想要在学校里讲授黑人英语；（2）可耻的英语变体将被当作有效的交谈方式，某些人对此有一种义愤感。,The furor over Oakland's recently adopted resolution regarding Ebonics is based in large part on two issues: (1) there is a misunderstanding that the Oakland school system wants to teach BE in the schools; and (2) there is a sense of outrage among some that a stigmatized variety of English would be treated as a valid way of talking.
6116,我出席了采纳黑人语决议的地方教育董事会会议，在会上，董事会成员、父母和教师支持决议的所有讨论，这些讨论都围绕着讲授儿童标准英语的重要性而展开的。,"When I attended the school board meeting at which the Ebonics resolution was adopted, all discussion in support of the resolution by board members, parents and teachers was centered around the importance of teaching SE to children."
6116,决议不是关于讲授黑人英语而是关于教标准英语的最佳方式。,This resolution is not about teaching BE but about the best way to teach SE.
6116,董事会所关心的是：儿童已在家里学会了黑人英语——与标准英语有许多差异的语言变体。,"The children whom the board is concerned about have learned BE at home, a linguistic variety that has many differences from SE."
6117,人类学本身就是一个话语。,Anthropology itself is a discourse.
6117,较早的现代人类学派是部分地反映了它们所起源的社会某些部分的利益的话语。,"The older, modern anthropologies are discourses partly representing the interests of the segments of society from which they stem."
6117,但是，比如说，如果把功能主义仅定义为英国殖民运动产生的话语，就太简单化了（参见 Asad 1973 )。,"Yet it would be too simplistic to define functionalism, for example, simply as a discourse produced by the British colonial enterprise (cf. Asad 1973)."
6117,而把人类学视为在其整个历史中有关人类生活条件的－种话语，则会更有意义。这一话语，一方面是在被人类学家观察的那些群体的对话中展开的，另一方面是在人类学家自身之间的对话中展开的。,"Rather, it is more meaningful to view anthropology throughout its history as a discourse on the human condition, played out in a dialogue between those under the scrutiny of anthropologists on the one hand, and the anthropologists themselves on the other."
6118,它并非将缺席的东西召唤出来的某种存在，它是那种既不在场也不缺席的即将到来的东西，因为我们并不将“唤起”理解为在时间和空间上将两种差异联系起来，如唤起以及被唤起的某种东西。,"It is not a presence that calls into being something that was absent; it is acomin g to be of what was neither there present nor absent, for we are not to understand ""evocation"" as linking two differences in time and place, as something that evokes and something else evoked."
6118,唤起是一体的，是一个单一的事件或过程，我们必须抵制语法的诱惑，它会使我们去设想“唤起y”的命题形式必然意味着x和y是不同的实体，它们被第三方而不是被特殊的、称为“唤起”的“过程-实体”所连接。并且，它还会使我们设想，必须在时间上先于y，从而，X必须是y的一个条件或者y是x的一个结果。,"Evocation is a unity, a single event or process, and we must resist the temptation of grammar that would make us think that the propositional form ""x evokes y"" must mean that x and y are different entities linked by a third rather peculiar ""process-entity"" called ""evoke,"" a n d that, moreover, x must precede y in time, and consequently x must be a condition of y or y a result of x."
6119,毫无疑问，这促进北美社会的“永不满足感”和“内在驱力”，在某种程度上说，它促使个人努力工作，到经济需要他们的地方去，这非常符合工业社会和后工业社会的需要。,"Undoubtedly, this value contributes to the ""restlessness"" and adrivenness, of North American society, and to the degree it motivates individuals to work hard and to go where the economy needs them, it fits well with the needs of an industrial society."
6119,因此，中国社会中的个人被牢固地束缚于一个较大的群体上，他们对这一群体负有一生的责任，而北美人除丈夫或妻子外独立于所有其他亲属，甚至婚姻承担的义务也缩小了。,"Thus, while individuals in Chinese society are firmly bound into a larger group they have lifelong obligations to, North Americans are isolated from all other kin save husband or wife, and even here commitment to marriage has lessened."
6119,许多年轻情侣既没有结婚也没有未来婚姻的打算就生活在一起（参见图5.1)。,More couples live together without either marriage or future plans for marriage.
6120,这里很明显存在四种情况（Hunt 1967）。,Four positions obviously suggest themselves (cf. Hunt 1967).
6120,第一，社会与文化领域在一边，而个体心智在另一边，二者分离，各不相同，在分析时也须如此论述。,"In the first, the realms of society and culture on the one hand and individual psyche on the other are separate and distinct, and must be analytically treated as such."
6120,由此很容易想到涂尔干（Durkheim 1966），他一直坚持将社会学与心理学区分开来，因为集体意识的社会事实与心理变量不相关。,"One can recall in this connection Durkheim (1966), and his insistence upon a distantiation of sociology from psychology since the ‘social fact’ of the conscience collective made psychic variables irrelevant."
6120,第二种情况，按照博厄斯及其后继者解释的，可能是第一种情况派生出来的。,"The second position is perhaps a derivative of this, as expounded by Boas and his descendants."
6121,各种各样的继嗣群体——世系群、氏族、联族和半偶族（moieties）——都是解决人类社会普遍面临的许多问题的方便手段：如何保持某些资源的完整性，因资源一旦分割就要遭到破坏；为各项重大任务提供劳动力，因完成这些任务需要的劳动力超过家户所能提供的劳动力储备；使一个独立的本地群体成员能向其他群体中的成员寻求支持和保护。,"Descent groups of various kinds—lineages, clans, phratries, and moieties—are convenient devices for solving a number of problems human societies commonly confront: how to maintain the integrity of resources that cannot be divided without destruction; generating workforces for tasks that require a labor pool larger than households can provide; and allowing members of one sovereign local group to claim support and protection from members of another."
6121,并非所有的社会都有继嗣群体，在很多靠采集食物为生的社会和工业社会，这些问题部分通过亲类群人具有共同血缘活着的亲属一起来解决的。,"Not all societies have descent groups; in many food-foraging and industrial societies, some of these problems often are handled by the kindred, a group of people with a living relative in common."
6121,但是，亲类不像继嗣群体那样延续一代以上，其成员资格也不是得到清楚明白的界定。,"The kindred, however, does not exist in perpetuity, as does the descent group, nor is its membership as clearly and explicitly defined."
6121,因此，它与继嗣群体相比是种较弱的单元。,"Hence, it is generally a weaker unit than the descent group."
6122,该垃圾调研项目另一个饶有兴趣的发现是，当1973年牛肉价格达到最高记录时，家庭浪费的牛肉量也达到最高（不只在图森市如此，在全国其他地方也一样）。,"Another interesting finding of the Garbage Project is that when beef prices reached an all-time high in 1973, so did the amount of beef wasted by households (not just in Tucson, but other parts of the country as well)."
6122,尽管常识引导我们做出正好相反的假定，但是高价和匮乏与浪费更多相关，而不是更少相关。,"Although common sense would lead us to suppose just the opposite, high prices and scarcity correlate with more, rather than less, waste."
6122,显然，这一发现是重要的，因为它们证实，单独依靠常规访谈调查技术形成的关于人类行为的观点可能有严重的错误。同样，它们表明，人们实际所做的不一定与他们认为他们所做的相一致。,"Obviously, such findings are important, for they suggest that ideas about human behavior based on conventional interview-survey techniques alone can be seriously in error."
6122,1987年，垃圾调研项目在美国其他不同地区的垃圾填埋地，开始一项检验发掘项目。,"In 1987, the Garbage Project began a program of test excavations in landfills in various parts of the country."
6123,家庭不仅仅是建构物，也是一种象征。,"Family is not only constructed, but also acts as a metaphor."
6123,“父亲”、“母亲”、“儿子”、“女儿”不是基因所赋予的。,"The titles ""father"", ""mother"", ""son"", ""daughter"" are not genetically given."
6123,它们全都是由历史和社会决定的。,They too are socially and historically determined.
6123,我们看到不同“血缘(blood)”、不同的文化、甚至不同语言的年轻人被组合进非洲的家庭。,"Young people of different ""blood"", of different culture and even of different language can be and often have been integrated into African ""families""."
6123,这样的家庭是认同和忠诚指向的单位，无论是自愿的或者是强迫的，它们通常与族性没有太多的关系。,"Such families are units of identity and adherence, whether voluntary or coerced, and they often have little to do with ethnicity."
6124,由于受美国文化同化的影响较大，他们中的一些人努力使他们自己与老一代成员区别开来，他们认为后者有些过时了。,"Being more assimilated into North American culture, some of them sought to separate themselves somewhat from members of older generations, who were perceived as a bit old-fashioned."
6124,然而，他们却仍然希望维持犹太人家族团结的传统伦理。,Yet they still wished to maintain the traditional Jewish ethic of family solidarity.
6124,因此他们成立了堂表兄弟姐妹俱乐部，这种倶乐部由一群有着共同祖先的第一代堂表兄弟姐妹及其配偶和子女组成。,"The result was the cousins club, which consists of a group of first cousins who share a common ancestry, their spouses, and their descendants."
6124,他们的父母、袓父、外袓父母因其陈旧观念和生活方式都被排除在外。,"Excluded are parents and grandparents of the cousins, with their older views and lifestyles."
6124,两可系继嗣仍然是首要的组织原则，不过，代的原则已将它改变了。,"Ambilineal descent remains the primary organizing principle, but it has been modified by a generational principle."
6124,除此之外，堂表兄弟姐妹俱乐部在很多方面都与家庭圈有相同的组织和运行方式。,"Otherwise, cousins clubs are organized and function in many of the same ways as family circles."
6125,通常，这些回报馈赠（prestation）不会保留确定的账目，因为每个种姓对其他种姓都具有特定的义务。,"Frequently, no exact account was kept of these prestations, since each caste had specified duties toward the others."
6125,在现代印度，按照传统惯例使贾吉摩尼制度发挥作用会很困难。,"In modern India, it can be difficult to make the jajmani system function according to traditional practice."
6125,首先，货币经济使人们有可能和彼此不存在贾吉摩尼关联的人那里购买所有种类的服务和商品——如今这已经得到普及。,"First, the monetary economy has made it possible – and this is now widespread – to buy all kinds of services and commodities from people with whom there is no jajmani relationship."
6125,其次，印度社会的变化已经产生了大量新的职业，而这些职业却没有被贾吉摩尼制度合法化。,"Second, changes in Indian society have created a large number of new occupations which are not legitimated through the jãti system."
6125,第三，印度乡村与资本市场和国家官僚体系的合作减弱了迦提之间的纽带关联，都市化使贾吉摩尼制度变得不切实际。,"Third, the incorporation of Indian villages into the capitalist market and state bureaucracy has weakened the ties between the jãtis.Urbanisation has made the jajmani system impractical."
6126,在巴厘岛，公鸡是一种极其可贵的东西，人们与它们有着密切的关系。,"In Bali, cocks are greatly prized, and men identify strongly with them."
6126,格尔茨分析斗鸡，将其作为巴厘人看待社会现实的一种标志。,Geertz analyzes cock fights as a symbol of the Balinese view of social reality.
6126,巴厘人强调地位和阶层、强调高低等级之间的差别，通过战斗的形式得到了表达；斗鸡仪式提供给巴厘人一种符号化和传达文化价值观的方式。,"Balinese emphasis on status and hierarchy, on distinctions between high and low castes, is expressed in the fights; the ritual of the cockfight provides the Balinese a way of symbolizing and communicating cultural values."
6127,在或多或少限于欧亚大陆的西部、南部和东部边缘范围，经济以集约经营的农业为基础的许多社会，女子结婚时往往随身带着嫁妆（dowry）。,"In a number of societies more or less restricted to the western, southern, and eastern margins of Eurasia, where the economy is based on intensive agriculture, women often bring a dowry with them at marriage."
6127,在美国，一种形式的嫁妆是新娘家支付婚礼费用的习俗。,A form of dowry in the United States is the custom of the bride's family paying the wedding expenses.
6127,实际上，嫁妆是父母财产中结婚女子的那一份，这份财产不是在她父母去世时传给她，而是在她结婚时分给她。,"In effect, a dowry is a womans share of parental property that, instead of passing to her upon her parents' death, is distributed to her at the time of her marriage."
6127,这并不意味着，她保留婚后对这份财产的控制权。,This does not mean she retains control of this property after marriage.
6127,例如，在许多欧洲国家，一个女子的财产完全由其丈夫控制。,"In a number of European countries, for example, a woman's property falls exclusively under her husband's control."
6128,搜集情报（有一个明确的暗中操纵和负面的目标）与精神分析有一些相似：都是从那些有意识地想要拒绝给出的个体那里获取信息。,"Spying, which has an explicitly manipulative and negative objective, bears one resemblance to psychoanalysis: both draw information from individuals that they consciously wish to withhold."
6128,但与捜集情报不同的是，这一操作在精神分析中服务于一个表面上的积极结果，即治愈病人。,"Unlike spying, this manipulation serves, in psychoanalysis, an ostensibly positive end, namely, a cure."
6128,有些民族志学者实际上一直是专业心理分析家，其他人则使用精神分析访谈技术，将其作为田野工作的一部分。,"Some ethnographers have actually been professional psychoanalysts, and others have employed the techniques of the psychoanalytical interview as part of fieldwork."
6129,然而，时过境迁，我们发现今天“间生性”（hybridity）的观念仍旧是活跃和有效的。,"Still, times have changed, and we find that today the notion of hybridity is alive and well."
6129,实际上，间生性已经被认为是后殖民的、全球化的和破碎的认同等等的不可或缺的组成部分（例如Bauman 1995；Haraway 1990），世上的每个人，包括“土著”和文明的仆人，都已经变成了间生物。,"Indeed hybridity is thought to be part-andparcel of the post-colonial, globalized, fragmented identity—and for some (e.g.see Bauman 1995; Haraway 1990), everyone in the world, including both ‘natives’ and civil servants, have become hybrids."
6129,因此那些后殖民传统的作家倾向于将间生性书写成西方文明的产物。,Thus writers within the post-colonialist tradition tend to write as if hybridity is a product of Western civilization.
6130,这些描述不那么套式化，具有相对感，一个原因是，他们都关注文本技巧的无效性（ineffectiveness)——也就是対这些技巧有意识的使用：移情、梦的转译、讲故事、多声音和多视角、突出幽默的颠覆和多个身份/传统/文化的辩证并置，以及对覇权话语的批评。,"One of the reasons for the relative sense that these portraits are less stereotyped is their attention to the ineffectiveness of textual techniques—that is, the self-conscious employment of such devices as transference, dream-translation, talk-story, multiple voices and perspectives, the highlighting of humorous inversions and dialectical juxtaposition of identities/traditions/cultures, and the critique of hegemonic discourses."
6130,在流行术语行话的今天，他们展示了后现代主义知识的文本间性、交互参照和跨语言形态。,"In the fashionable jargon of the day, they illustrate intertextuality, inter-reference, and the interlinguistic modalities of post-modernist knowledge."
6130,在实践的层面，这样的自我意识和高超技巧能重振民族志作品的活力，而后者再一次可以完成人类学的文化批评承诺：让人意识到那些被理所当然地接受下来的方式其实是社会文化的建构，而对此我们可以行使自己的职责。,"On the practical level, such selfconscious and virtuoso technique could contribute to a reinvigorated ethnographic literature, one that can again fulfill the anthropological promise of cultural criticism: of making our taken-for-granted ways recognizable as sociocultural constructions for which we can exercise responsibility."
6131,在一般灵长目动物之中，单配偶交配模式不是常见的。,"Among primates in general, monogamous mating patterns are not common."
6131,虽然某些南美猴的较小种，几个岛居的食叶猕猴种群，以及全部较小的类人猿（长钙猿和合趾猴），终身与异性单个个体交配，但是这些动物与人类都没有密切关系，“单配偶的”灵长目动物甚至也没有显示与我们最近的灵长目动物亲戚或我们自己古代袓先特有的雄性与雌性的解剖学差异程度。,"Although some smaller species of South American monkeys, a few island-dwelling populations of leaf-eating Old World monkeys, and all of the smaller apes (gibbons and siamangs) do mate for life with but one individual of the opposite sex, none of these are closely related to human beings.Nor do monogamous primates ever display the degree of anatomical differences between males and females characteristic of our closest primate relatives or of our own ancient ancestors."
6131,因此，人类是不可能以单配偶交配模式开始其生涯的。,Thus it is not likely the human species began its career as one with monogamous mating patterns.
6132,当代西方社会的许多青少年可能就经历过这种尴尬的情境——当他们和父母外出的时候却与他们的朋友不期而遇。,Most adolescents in contemporary Western societies have presumably experienced this kind of awkward situation when they have unexpectedly met their friends while out with their parents.
6132,正如前文戈夫曼的著作中所例示的那样，角色理论可以是描述社会关系的有力工具，并且它的用处在后文还要进一步展现。,"Role theory, as exemplified above in Goffman's work, can be a powerful tool for describing social relationships, and its usefulness will be shown further later."
6132,但是，我们仍然应该谨记，身份和角色都是从社会生活不间断的进程中所抽象出的理论概念，并且是作为一种客位的术语。,"We should nevertheless keep in mind that statuses and roles are theoretical abstractions from the ongoing process of social life, and are as such etic terms."
6132,比较研究揭示，所有的人类群体都具有自我或人称的概念（Geertz 1983；Mauss 1985 [1938]；Fitzgerald 1993），但是这种概念在重要的方面有所不同。,"Comparative research has indicated that all human groups have a concept of the self or the person (Geertz 1983; Mauss 1985 [1938]; Fitzgerald 1993), but this concept varies in important ways."
6132,在欧洲社会，自我通常被理解为是不可分割的（就像单词“individual”）、完全的、独立自主的——作为一个不受约束的行为者。,"In European societies, the self is usually conceived of as undivided (as in the word ""individual""), integrated and sovereign – as an independent agent."
6132,但是，在许多非西方社会，自我却更多地被看做是个人社会关系的相加总和。,"In many non-Western societies, however, the self may be seen rather as the sum total of the social relationships of the individual."
6133,这种文化观与威利斯的观点很是契合，因为作为特别的文化形式的工人阶级——这位民族志作者的论述对象——纯粹是政治经济学的一种特定世界体系的发明。,"Now this view of culture suits Willis very well, because working classes as distinctive cultural forms—meat for the ethnographer — are pure inventions of a particular world historical system of political economy."
6133,在工业化的西方，阶级文化是界定许多人的生活形式的唯一文化。,"In the industrial West, class culture is the only culture that defines the form of life of many people."
6133,人类学家擅长于研究那些处于发源于西方的世界历史潮流之边缘的人们，他们习惯性地将文化视做一个完整的时空隔绝体，尽管其自身内部也存在着矛盾，但至少可以说它是以其自身的完整性来抵制外界。,"Anthropologists, specialists in the study of those on the margins of world historical trends emanating from the West, are accustomed to staging culture as an integral spatio-temporal isolate, not without its own internal contradictions,but at least with its own integrity against the world, so to speak."
6134,就民族志而言，功能主义和结构主义都例证了整体论。,Functionalism and configurationalism both illustrate holism applied ethnographically.
6134,一个整体社会或一种整体文化被描述成一个单位，作为一种起作用的系统或一个连贯的模式。,"A whole society or a whole culture is depicted as a unity, as a working system or a coherent pattern."
6134,作为描述生活方式的一种方法，这种写照有优点也有缺点。,"As a means of describing a way of life, this kind of portrayal has virtues but also drawbacks."
6134,要强调社会或文化的一统，就会忽略多样性；要强调稳定性，就会忽略变动。,To emphasize the unity of the society or the culture is to ignore the diversity; to emphasize constancy is to ignore change.
6135,在人类历史中，人类起源和进化的故事尤为多产。,Stories of human origins and evolution abound in human history.
6135,每种文化都有其人类创造的神话，而且都会有进化故事出现（当然也有与之竞争的学说，例如神造论）。,"Every culture has its myth of human creation, and the story of evolution is within this genre (as also are competing doctrines, such as Creationism)."
6135,但进化论并不仅仅是一个故事，它是一个科学表达的理论，因此它可以激发人们进行研究。,"But evolutionism is not only a story, it is a theory couched scientifically so that it stimulates research."
6135,植物学家和地质学家与体质人类学家和考古学家通力合作，一起挖掘，加入所谓的跨学科团队工作，构建对未发现的过去的系统整合。,"Botanists and geologists cooperate with physical anthropologists and archeologists as they all swarm around the dig, joining in so-called interdisciplinary teamwork to construct holistic syntheses of a past uncovered."
6136,查尔斯•达尔文（Darwin 1859)拒绝接受拉马克的观点。,Charles Darwin (1859) rejected the Lamarckian view.
6136,他则主张，进化只能通过遗传我们现在所称的遗传特性来实现。,He argued instead that evolution proceeds only through the passing down of what we now call genetic traits.
6136,偶然的突变将产生更大量的变种，而且在各自的环境中最成功地生存下来的那些变种将更有效地繁衍后代。,"Accidental mutation produced greater variety, and the forms which were most successful in their respective environments would reproduce more effciently."
6136,艾尔弗雷德•拉赛尔•华莱士得出了与达尔文相似的结论，达尔文和他一起将进化机制描述为“性选择”（sexual selection)。,"Darwin, along with Alfred Russel Wallace (who came to similar conclusions), described the mechanism of evolution as ‘sexual selection’."
6137,意识的控制所造就的对环境反应的可塑性将会极大增加原始人类的适应能力。,"Engendered by conscious control, a plasticity of environmental response would have greatly increased hominid fitness."
6137,环境中对原始人类来说重要的部分会以它自己的方式联系起来：家庭和朋友，自我之外的陌生人和敌人。,"A significant part of this environment, moreover, for the hominid, would long have concerned others of its own kind: family and friends, strangers and enemies beyond the self."
6137,预测他们的活动，推测他们的行为，这也会带来适应优势。,"Anticipating their movements, predicting their behaviour, would also confer adaptive advantage."
6137,因此近年来人类学的研究也一直关注意识的系统进化和人的社会化（Ingold 1990）。,"Hence, anthropological work has recently concerned the relationship between a phylogenetic evolution of consciousness and human sociation (Ingold 1990)."
6138,从进化过程的观点来看，每个历史事件皆是偶然的，在一定意义上说是不可预测的。,From the point of view of the evolutionary process every histoncal event is an accident and in a sense unpredictable.
6138,我们可以预料将会找到治愈癌症的药方，但不可能预见到谁将发现和将在何时发现它。,"We may predict that a cure for cancer will be found, but to predict who will make the discovery and when is impossible."
6138,欧洲国家在不远的将来会再次卷入一场大战，这是人们确有把握作出的一个预言。技术、经济、政治、军事诸般实力的增长，使得另一场大战不可避免。,"That the nations of Europe will be embroiled again in a great war in the not distant future is as safe a prediction as one could make; the development of technological, economic, political, and military forces makes another war inevitable."
6139,从本质上说，人类学中进化论有四个广义的分支：单线进化、普遍进化、多线进化和新达尔文主义。,"Essentially, there are just four broad strands of evolutionist thinking in anthropology: unilinear, universal, and multilinear evolutionism, plus neo-Darwinism."
6139,前三个理论都属渐进研究方法，他们的标签来自多线进化论倡导者朱利安•斯图尔德（Steward 1955 [1953]: 11-29)。,"The first three have been gradualist approaches, and their labels come from Julian Steward (1955 [1953]: 11–29), a practitioner of multilinear evolutionism."
6139,新达尔文主义则来自不同的与渊源，来自20世纪70年代的社会生物学及其随后更晚近的对象征文化起源的研究。,"Neo-Darwinism comes in different guises, from 1970s sociobiology and its aftermath to more recent approaches to the origin of symbolic culture."
6140,此外，人类学家南希˙桑希尔发现，在129个社会的223样本中，只有57个社会有具体的规则，反对父母与孩子或同胞兄弟姐妹乱伦（原来乱伦禁忌的普遍性不过如此！,"Moreover, anthropologist Nancy Thornhill found that, in a sample of 129 societies, only 57 had specific rules against parent-child or sibling incest (so much for the universality of the incest taboo!)."
6140,）那个数字的两倍，114个社会有明确规则，控制与堂表兄弟姐妹，或者堂表姐妹夫、堂表嫂或弟媳等相关的活动。,"Twice that number, 114, had explicit rules to control activity with cousins, in-laws, or both."
6140,如果避免近亲交配的生物学基础确实在人类中存在，那么显然它的作用决不是完全有效的。,"If indeed a biological basis for inbreeding avoidance exists among humans, it clearly is far from completely effective in its operation."
6140,人们也不理解它的机制。,Nor is its mechanism understood.
6140,而且，它仍留给我们诸如此类的问题：为什么有些社会有明确的乱伦禁忌而其他社会则没有？,"Moreover, it still leaves us with questions such as these: Why do some societies have an explicit taboo while others do not?"
6140,为什么某些社会不仅容忍某些形式的乱伦，而且甚至还鼓励它们？,And why do some societies not only condone certain kinds of incest but also even favor them?
6141,通过禁忌的隔绝作用，那些威胁到世界清晰划定的秩序的污秽，那些将会“污染”其洁净的污秽，被回避了；而某一事物受到污染这一观念将会保护那些受世人尊重的规则与分类不受矛盾的困扰。,"Hedged about with taboo, the dirt which threatens the clear-cut ordering of the world, which would ""pollute"" its cleanliness, is eschewed; while the notion that something is polluted serves to protect cherished principles and categories from contradiction."
6141,惟一的例外是某些特殊的仪式场合。,"The only exceptions are certain extraordinary, ritual situations."
6141,这种污秽表达的无序性既是危险，也是力量。,"For while the disorder which such dirt represents is a threat, it is also recognized as powerful."
6141,既然不受现存的分类和秩序的约束，污秽也预示着新的可能性。,"Unrestricted by existing categories and order, it ushers in new possibilities."
6142,结构主义在展示部分怎样构成整体上类似于功能主义，但是，这一类想象的整合，用前面提到的区分来说更多是“逻辑一意义”，而不是“因果一功能”。,"Configurationalism resembles functionalism in showing how parts form a whole, but the kind of integration envisioned is, to usea distinction noted earlier, more ""logico-meaningful"" than ""causal functional."""
6142,其重点并不是非常多地展示系统怎样正常运作，就像在库拉圈经济中那样，而是揭示隐藏在文化背后的假设前提和从那些前提假设中产生的生活方式。,"The point is not so much to show how the system works, as in the economics of the Kula, as to display the premises behind the culture and the way the warp and woof of life coherently flow from those premises."
6142,本尼迪克特（Ruth Benedict)在《文化模式》（Patterm of Culture)中描述平原印第安人文化的前提假设为“酒神”，普布罗印第安人文化的前提假设则为“日神”。,"Ruth Benedict in Patterns of Culture depicted the premises of Plains Indian culture as ""Dionysian,"" those of the Pueblo Indian as ""Apollonian."""
6143,既要促成男性和女性之间的经济合作，又要同时满足母亲和子女的亲密联系，一个两全其美的办法就是建立包括成年男女两性的居住群体。,An effective way both to facilitate economic cooperation between the sexes and to provide for a close bond between mother and child at the same time is through the establishment of residential groups that include adults of both sexes.
6143,男性和女性角色的不同性质——它们是由不同的文化界定的——要求一个小孩必须要有一个相同性别的成年人作为其学习恰当的成年角色的合适榜样。,"The differing nature of male and female roles, as these are defined by different cultures, requires a child to have an adult of the same sex available to serve as a proper model for the appropriate adult role."
6143,成年男性和女性在同一个居住群体中的存在满足了这一要求。,The presence of adult men and women in the same residential group provides for this.
6143,按照第八章的定义，家庭是由一名女性，她抚养的子女，以及至少一个通过婚姻或血亲关系加入进来的男人所组成的居住群体。,"As defined in Chapter 8, a family is a residential group composed of a woman, her dependent children, and at least one man joined through marriage or consanguineal (""blood"") relationship."
6143,同样(参见第八章），由于性别角色是由文化界定的，所以另一个女性也能够扮演这个男人的角色。,"Again (see Chapter 8), because gender roles are culturally defined, the man may in some cases be a female."
6144,书写的本质，已经被暗示出来了，就是赋予经验以意义：从当下后退一步，仔细观察一个给定的时刻，并将其与正在进行的文本中的其他时刻相联结。,"The essence of writing, it has been suggested, is the practice of giving meaning to experience: of stepping back from the present, scrutinizing a given moment and connecting it to others in an ongoing text."
6144,书写是已被删除的经验，或者是元经验。,"Writing is experience-once-removed, or meta-experience."
6144,经验自身是没有条理和意义的，就像存在主义主张的，真正的经验主义的“自在的存在”是“荒谬的”（Lyman 1984）。,"For experience in and of itself is incoherent and meaningless; as Existentialism has it, the truly empirical ‘being-in-itself’ is ‘absurd’ (cf. Lyman 1984)."
6145,后面一种做法在某些大学校园的适用人群更为普遍，特别是对注册学生数量庞大的课程，如果大部分班级成员做得更好的话，就宣告了某些学生的失败，无论他们实际上做得有多好。,"The latter practice, widely used, especially for heavily enrolled courses, on some college campuses, condemns some students to failure, irrespective of how well they actually do, if most of the class does better."
6145,这使学生投入到与彼此竞争的状态之中，因为他们很快就明白，其他班级成员越是没有他们自己做得好，他们得到体面成绩的机会就越大。,"This puts students in competition with one another, for they soon learn that their chances for a decent grade depend, as much as anything, on other class members not doing well."
6145,如果奖学金很高，那么他们就会千方百计为同学下绊子，防止他们也同样出色。,"If the stakes are high, students may devote considerable effort to placing obstacles in the way of classmates so that they are prevented from doing too well."
6145,因此，在美国社会，当一个人长大后，不论他如何看待这个现象，他们都已得到一条明确的信息：成功在某种程度上以别人受损为代价。,"Thus, by the time individuals have grown up in U.S. society, regardless of what they may think about it, they have received a clear message: Success comes at someone else expense."
6146,很多文化生产者都被一个普遍性的问题困扰过——这个问题也许在戏剧中比在小说中出现得更为频繁：是完全与现实主义传统决裂呢，还是尝试着去扩展它。,The general problem which has exercised many producers—perhaps more often in plays than in novels—is whether to break with the realist tradition altogether or to try to extend it.
6146,我认为我们有理由考虑，那些被资产阶级形式所排斥的特定领域现在可以在多大程度上被引进到小说中来……这给传统的形式加入了极度的复杂性。,I think there is a case for seeing how far certain areas which the bourgeois form typically excluded could now be integrated in the novel....
6146,因为就我看来，传统形式以往的确是依赖于一种可知的共同体现念的，而现在我们所面临的事实是：它再也不能被称为一个共同体，也不再能以先前的方式被知晓。,"That has produced extreme complications for the traditional form because it did depend, in my view, on the idea of a knowable community, and now we are faced with the fact that this cannot be called a community and is not knowable in former ways."
6146,其结果便是一种极度的形式危机。,The result is an extreme crisis of form.
6147,英裔美国人使用的爱斯基摩制，强调核心家庭的地位，它把所有其他属于同一辈分的亲属都混入少数笼统的、一般未加分化的范畴之中。,"The Eskimo system, used by Anglo Americans, emphasizes the nuclear family and merges all other relatives in a given generation into a few large, generally undifferentiated categories."
6147,在易洛魁制中，父亲及其兄弟共用同一个称呼，而母亲及其姐妹则共用另一个称呼。,"In the Iroquois system, a single term is used for a father and his brother and another term for a mother and her sister."
6147,平表兄弟姐妹等同于兄弟和姐妹，但却区别于交表兄弟姐妹。,Parallel cousins are equated with brothers and sisters but distinguished from cross cousins.
6147,奥马哈制和克劳制中也一样，但有一点不同，它们把交表兄弟姐妹等同于不同辈分的亲属。,"The same is true in the Omaha and Crow systems, except they equate cross cousins with relatives of other generations."
6147,相对而言，比较少见的苏丹制或描述制，对有的姑姨婶、叔伯舅、堂表兄弟姐妹以及亲兄弟姐妹都区别对待。,"The relatively rare Sudanese or descriptive system treats all aunts, uncles, cousins, and siblings as different from one another."
6148,世纪转折时新的人类学主张拥有自己学术空间的必要性，只有这样才能捍卫真理和客观性。,"The brand new science of anthropology was faced at the turn of the century with the necessity of claiming its own intellectual space, over which it could be the guardian of truth and objectivity."
6148,它需要生产自己的研究对象（Fabian 1983)。,It needed to produce its own object (cf. Fabian 1983).
6148,正是马凌诺夫斯基提出的“土著观点”为现代的民族志写作确立了标准、规则和典范。,"It was Malinowski, cited above as the promoter of ‘the native point of view’, who set the standards, the rules and norms, for modern ethnographic writing."
6149,一个普遍的假定是，主位观察是错误的，而客位观察是正确的。,"It is a common assumption that emic perspectives are wrong, whereas the etic perspectives are correct."
6149,这是一种令人遗憾的建构问题的方式。,This is an unfortunate way of framing the issue.
6149,问题不在于正确的是“本地人”还是“科学家”，而在于社会科学家有其专业的兴趣，而他们追求的那种洞察力常常与田野点本地人的兴趣是不一致的。有很多种同样正确的方式去描述一种社会和文化的系统：你的兴趣决定你的选择。一个关于主位-客位的区别的更深误解是，主位的观念是“具体的”而客位的观念是“抽象的”。这也许是事实，但并非天生正确。,"The point is not whether the ""natives"" or the ""scientists"" are correct, but rather that social scientists have specialised interests and that the kinds of insight they aim at are frequently not identical with the interests of their hosts in the field."
6149,正如格尔茨（Geertz 1983）提醒我们的，许多被研究的人民使用高度抽象的或“远离经验的（experience-distant）”概念，如“上帝”、“魔法”、“抵押利息”或“因果报应”。,
6149,问题：错译改1：一个普遍的假定是，主位观察是错误的，而客位观察是正确的。,
6149,这是一种令人遗憾的建构问题的方式。问题不在于正确的是“本地人”还是“科学家”，而在于社会科学家有其专业的兴趣，而他们追求的那种洞察力常常与田野点本地人的兴趣是不一致的。有很多种同样正确的方式去描述一种社会和文化的系统：你的兴趣决定你的选择。,There are a number of equally correct ways of describing a cultural and social system; one's choice must depend on one's interests.
6149,一个关于主位-客位的区别的更深误解是，主位的观念是“具体的”而客位的观念是“抽象的”。,"A further misunderstanding regarding the emic–etic distinction amounts to the idea that emic notions are ""concrete"" whereas etic notions are ""abstract""."
6149,这也许是事实，但并非天生正确。正如格尔茨（Geertz 1983）提醒我们的，许多被研究的民族使用高度抽象的或“远离经验的（experience-distant）”概念，如“上帝”、“魔法”、“抵押利息”或“因果报应”。,"As Geertz (1983) reminds us, many of the studied peoples use highly abstract, or ""experience-distant"", concepts such as ""God"", ""witchcraft"", ""mortgage interest"" or ""karma""."
6150,为廓清思想起见，花费些时间再次强调一下以上区别的实质所在，也许是有所裨益的。,"Even at the cost of repetition, it might be well, for the sake of clarity, to re-emphasize the nature of the distinctions just made."
6150,实际上，每个事件都有4维特性，并在一个4维的空间一时间连续体中占有其位置。,"Actually, each event has a four-dimensional character and has its place in a four-dimensional, space-time continuum."
6150,例如，雨量是宇宙进化过程中的一个事件，而我们也可以如是地理解它。,"Thus the raindrop is an event in the process of cosmic evolution, and we may view it as such."
6150,但是，我们还可以从另外的向度出发去考察它，即从纯粹时间或纯粹非时间的向度（在这个范围内，我们只虑及在雨量、地球和云雾等的空间关系的变动）上上考察它。,"But we may also view it in other contexts: in a purely temporal context, or in a wholly non-temporal context (in which we consider only the alteration in spatial relationships between the raindrop, the earth, the clouds, etc.)."
6150,这些向度自然是我们自己创造的手段。,"These contexts are, of course, devices of our own making."
6150,它们是我们任意择定，据以认识和思考现实的着眼点，好似我们从事科学活动的各类方式和渠道。,"They are arbitrarily selected points of view from which we regard and consider reality; they are the forms, the channels, so to speak, within which we science."
6151,18世纪吉贝蒂斯塔·维柯在《新科学》中首次指出在对口号的研究与对文化形式和效果的研究之间存在着系统性关联，但是直到最近的一些思想家，如哲学家奥斯汀（J.L. Austin)和批评家肯尼斯·伯克（Kenneth Burke)才促使人类学家开始重视言语权力对他人的影响。,"While it was in the eighteenth century that Giambattista Vico's Scienza Nuova first propounded a systematic link between the study of rhetoric and the study of cultural forms and effects, it is more recent thinkers such as philosopher J.L. Austin and critic Kenneth Burke who have inspired an anthropological focus on the power of speech to affect others."
6151,奥斯汀（Austin l971，1975)认为，言语应该具有意义、力量和效果。,"For Austin (1971, 1975), speech should be appreciated as having meaning, force and effect."
6151,特别是言语行动最重要的组成部分“表述方式”，不仅包含对社会世界的描述（“陈述”），而且也赋予其形式和内容。,"In particular, an important range of speech-acts, performative utterances', do not merely describe the social world (""declarative"") but give it form and content too."
6151,言语具有“以言行事的力量” (illocutionary force)促成社会事件，言语作为社会行动的机制会产生显著的社会效应。,"Here is speech with the ""illocutionary force"" to create social happenings, speech as an instrument of social action with significant social consequences."
6152,例如在政治语境中，红色又有别的含义。英国劳动党政客的徽章是红色的，以此与保守党（蓝色）和自由民主党（黄色）区分；与无政府主义者（黑色）相反，共产主义革命 者的旗帜是红色的。,"In a political context, for example, red means something else: Labour as opposed to (blue) Conservative or (yellow) Liberal Democrat on British politicians’ rosettes; or Communist as opposed to (black) Anarchist, in flags carried by revolutionaries."
6152,（我也许应该补充说明，这里的“选择项”与第一章中库恩的用法不同；正如索绪尔所提醒的，词汇的意思是从语境中产生的。）,"(I should perhaps add that the usage of the term ‘paradigm’ in this paragraph is different from the Kuhnian usage explained in chapter 1; as Saussurians remind us, words also take their meanings from context.)"
6153,尽管人们通常认为，大公司对外部市场力1做出的反应是非个人化的，但事实上它们是受控于强有力的经济精英，这些精英直接从这些公司的运作中获益。,"Though typically thought of as responding impersonally to outside market forces, large corporations are in fact controlled by powerful economic elites who benefit directly from their operations."
6153,例如，在1994年，仅仅10个人就指挥着北美的37个公司，其联合资产达2万亿美元，相当于很多国家的政府总资产（参见图16.2），并占美国所有“营利”型产业法人资产总值的10%。,"For example, in 1994, just 10 individuals helped direct 37 North American companies whose combined assets of $2 trillion rival those of many governments, and this represented nearly 10% of all corporate assets in the United States <sfor profit5' businesses."
6153,但是，世界上最大的个人股东和最有权势的公司董事，却并不像政治领袖那样出名（仅447位个人拥有1.1万亿美元，相当于全世界下层52%的人的收入总和）。,"Yet, the world's largest in¬dividual stockholders and most powerful directors, unlike political leaders, are known to few people."
6153,因此，大多数人甚至都不能说出五个最大的跨国公司的名字来。,"For that matter, most people cannot even name the five largest multinational corporations."
6154,这种关于家的认识，也同社会生活中固有的运动相抵触，因为身份认同的变动是社会生活的本质之一。,"Such an understanding of home is also apposite for coming to terms with the movement inherent in social life, for charting the intrinsic migrancy of identity."
6154,从过去到现在，个体不断地在家之间迁移，或者在同时期多个的家之间迁移。,"Increasingly, individuals are seen as moving between homes, erstwhile to current, or as moving between multiple present homes."
6154,准确地说，跨国主义的论题隐含着在迁移和家这两个概念之间巨大的转变：人不仅可以待在家里进行迁移，而目迁移也能成为人最终的家园。,"More precisely, the thesis of transnationalism implies a radical change in the conceptualization of relations between movement and home: not only can one be at home in movement, but that movement can be one's very home."
6155,生活在同一家户中的扩大家庭，曾经是、现在也仍然是亚利桑那州霍皮印第安人的重要社会单位理想的状态是，由一名老年妇女作为一户之主，她的已婚女儿及其丈夫、子女和她住在一块。,"Extended families living together in single households were and often still are important social units among the Hopi Indians of Arizona.Ideally, the household head was an old woman; her married daughters, their husbands, and their children lived with her."
6155,该家户中的女性拥有土地，但耕种是男人们（通常是她们的丈夫）的事。,"The household women owned land, but the men (usually their husbands) tilled it."
6155,"当需要额外帮助的时候，比方说在收获季节，其他的男性亲戚或者朋友，或者当地的宗教组织所指派的人，就组成工作团队,把艰苦的劳动化为喜庆场合。","When extra help was needed during the harvest, for example, other male relatives, friends, or persons local religious organizations designated formed work groups and turned the hard work into a festive occasion."
6155,妇女们则一起从事家务劳动，如食物加工或制作陶器等。,"The women performed household tasks, such as processing food or making pottery, together."
6156,因为劳动分工非常简单，也许每个家户各管各的事情有好处。,"Since the division of labour is rather simple, it might be thought an advantage for each household to run its own business independently."
6156,但是，让雅诺马马人大规模地团结在一起有更加充分的理由。,"However, there are sound reasons for the Yanomamö to stick together in larger groups."
6156,首先，有必须集体完成的任务，比如狩猎和典礼。,"First, there are necessary tasks which have to be done collectively, such as hunting and rituals."
6156,其次，雅诺马马人定期地卷入与邻村人的世仇中，很自然，当他们经常面对这种情形时，人数众多既更加有力量也会更加安全。,"Second, the Yanomamö are periodically involved in feuds with their neighbours, and naturally there is both strength and security in numbers when they are regularly faced with this kind of situation."
6156,雅诺马马人好战到什么程度，在人类学家中间引起了激烈的争论（Lizot 1994）；当前的描述主要基于沙尼翁（Napoleon Chagnon）的引起争议却很透彻的研究。,"Just how warlike the Yanomamö are, is a matter of intense dispute among anthropologists (Lizot 1994); the present description is chiefly based on Napoleon Chagnon's controversial, but very thorough research."
6156,世仇的一个主要原因是对女人的猎取，在战斗中取得成功的村子因此会得以壮大。,One of the main reasons for feuding is the quest for women.Villages which are successful in military terms thus tend to grow.
6156,当雅诺马马人的村子达到一定的规模时，它会分裂，一个或几个家系会搬出去，然后在别处建立自己的夏波诺。,"When the Yanomamö village has reached a certain size, however, it is Small Places， Large Issuest as one or several lineages moves out and builds its own shabono elsewhere."
6157,这些职务都不是世袭的；他们要通过出色的人品和在与他人对权力的角逐中获胜才能获得。因为劳动分工非常简单，也许每个家户各管各的事情有好处。,"Neither of these offices is hereditary; they are achieved through outstanding personal qualities and through successfully competing for power with others.Since the division of labour is rather simple, it might be thought an advantage for each household to run its own business independently."
6157,但是，让雅诺马马人大规模地团结在一起有更加充分的理由。,"However, there are sound reasons for the Yanomamö to stick together in larger groups."
6157,首先，有必须集体完成的任务，比如狩猎和典礼。,"First, there are necessary tasks which have to be done collectively, such as hunting and rituals."
6157,其次，雅诺马马人定期地卷入与邻村人的世仇中，很自然，当他们经常面对这种情形时，人数众多既更加有力量也会更加安全。,"Second, the Yanomamö are periodically involved in feuds with their neighbours, and naturally there is both strength and security in numbers when they are regularly faced with this kind of situation."
6158,许多相关女性认为这是一种进步。,Many of the women concerned perceive this as an improvement.
6158,这一观点也适用于在巴基斯坦和印度这样的国家以及欧洲的移民中间，包办婚姻制度所要应对的挑战。,The same could be said of the challenges posed to the institution of arranged marriages in countries such as Pakistan and India and among immigrants in Europe.
6158,这些人口中有一部分人，尤其是中产阶级，年轻的男人和女人不再愿意被他们的家族群体拿来交换，他们参与了资本主义的劳动力市场，从而在经济上独立于家庭。他们实际上可以基于个人选择而结婚，而不是成为以家庭为基础的交换系统的一部分。,"In some segments of these populations, particularly in the middle classes, young men and women are no longer willing to be exchanged by their kin groups.Insofar as they are economically independent of their families because of participation in the capitalist labour market, they may actually marry on the basis of individual choice rather than being part of a family-based system of exchange."
6158,虽然这当然是与评价从维生经济到资本主义的转变中的道德和政治因素有关——而这种变化对于许多人来说，不仅是非洲人，当然都是灾难性的——最初的人类学的任务在于仔细规划这些变化产生的社会和文化后果。,"Although it may certainly be relevant to evaluate the moral and political aspects of a transition from a subsistence economy to capitalism – and the change has certainly been disastrous to many, not least Africans – the initial anthropological task lies in mapping out the social and cultural consequences of the changes."
6159,天地初开，地球被创造出来。,The earth is created.
6159,无机的力相互碰撞，然后结合产生生命。,"Inorganic forces collide, then combine to produce life."
6159,从最基本的生命进化到动物，从动物进化到哺乳动物，再从哺乳动物进化到类人猿。,"From elemental life evolve animals; from animals, mammals; and from mammals, primates."
6159,早期类人猿的自然栖息地——树——被用来练习抓握和立体视觉，后者使得人类祖先有可能去操控环境创造文化。,"The natural habitat of the early primates – trees – selects for grasping hands and stereoscopic vision, which equip the ancestors of humans to manipulate the environment to create culture."
6159,从树上下到地上，这些祖先进化成两腿站立，释放双手使用工具。,"Coming down from the trees, these ancestors evolve a two-legged stance, freeing the hands to use tools."
6159,使用工具反过来也释放了嘴的功能，不再仅仅是用于撕咬。,The use of tools in turn frees the mouth for functions other than grasping and tearing.
6160,就像在对普遍性的追求中那样，一个人可能会将这些研究划分成两类，一类集中于想法，一类集中于行为。,"As in the search for universals, one may divide these studies into those focusing on conduct and those focusing on thought."
6160,一个人也可能会在类型学、法律和数学公式间进行区别。,"One may also distinguish between typologies, laws, and mathematical formulations."
6160,类形学认可并定义特征群；随着一个人考察世界上的社会，一个人会看到，在发现特征 X的时候，也发现了特征Y；凡是在找到A的地方，也能找到B。一个共变特质的集合，就是一个“类型”。,"Typologies simply recognize and define clusters of traits; that is, as one surveys the societies of the world, one sees that where trait X is found, so also is trait Y, and where A is found, so also is B. A cluster of covarying traits is a ""type""."
6161,因而，“吉那”这个概念把人类学家所谓的财产、居住地、社会权利和义务，以及政治等集合在一个简单的家族关系术语中。只有男人和他们的孩子才是家系的成员。,"The concept of ginna thus groups what anthropologists see as property, place of residence, social rights and duties, and politics, in a single kinship term.Only men and their children are members of the lineage."
6161,妻子/母亲属于另外的不同中心的家系。,The wives/mothers belong to other lineages which are centred elsewhere.
6161,婚姻通常由两位父亲组织起来，他们用这种方式加强了友谊的非正式纽带。,"Marriage is usually organised by the two fathers, who strengthen informal ties of friendship in this way."
6161,多贡人在家系的层次上是异族婚配的。,The Dogon are exogamous at the lineage level.
6161,离婚也会发生：这时候，因为父系原则包含了所有的事情，父亲和他的家系有权要回他们的子女。,"Divorce does occur; as the patrilineal principle is all-encompassing, the father and his lineage are entitled to keep the children when this happens."
6162,文化和理性的增长被认为属于同一进程。,The growth of culture and of rationality were thought to belong to the same process.
6162,换句话说，随着时间的推移，人在智力、精神和审美方面变得更有“教养”。,"In other words, human beings became more ""cultivated"" as they progressed over time intellectually, spiritually and aesthetically."
6162,米歇尔·德·塞都（Michel de Certeau 1994:103)提出，这种模式把文化当作“有教养”的人的基本特征（其他人则被称为“传统的”），含有深刻的政治意味，通过统治者的运用成为一项十分有效的工具，引入优势道德规范，为他们自己赋权。,"De Certeau (1994:103) notes that such a model, which proclaims culture as a defining feature of ""cultivated"" human beings (other people have something called ""tradition""), can have a strong political agenda, and in the hands of empires it has served a rather useful tool for introducing elitist norms wherever they imposed power."
6163,迈克尔·奥克肖特（Michael Oakeshott 1962）认为，交谈就是人类文化所要实现的，也是人类社会固有的特征。,"For Michael Oakeshott (1962), conversation is what human cultures accomplish and what human societies inherit."
6163,交谈是代表不同的习惯和方式的个体的声音的汇集。,Conversation is a meeting of individual voices speaking in different idiom or mode.
6163,科学、诗歌、实践行动以及历史都是各种不同的讲述形式。,"Science, poetry, practical activity and history are such modes of speech, different universes of discourse."
6164,从历史上讲，家系一般更为单薄，作为比宗族更小型的群体而存在。,"Thus lineages are generally historically more shallow, and as a consequence smaller, groups than clans."
6164,在许多社会，包括特罗布里恩德群岛和斯瓦特河谷，一些家系被认为是偶尔结成了联盟而变成宗族——就像家族群体。,"In many societies, including the Trobriand Islands and Swat valley, several lineages considered to be related occasionally form alliances and so appear as clans – as kin groupings at a higher systemic level."
6164,人类学家建立了很多有关不同种类的宗族组织概念，但是我们应该记住，这些事我们自己的观念而不是被调查者的观念。,"Anthropologists have developed concepts about several kinds of clan organisation, but we should keep in mind that these notions are our own and not those of the informants."
6164,一种流传甚广的形式是圆锥型宗族，围绕一个集权领导团体的有层次的等级制度，每一个层次都有一个公认的领导者，通常是家系中最年长的男人，并且，在更高的层次上，作为一个整体的宗族还有一位首领。,"One widespread form is the conical clan, which is hierarchically ordered with a centralised leadership.There is one recognised leader, usually the oldest man of the lineage, at each level, and the clan as a whole has a chief at a higher level."
6165,在亚马逊人中，很难发现集体占有土地的群体，社区老人也很难约束其他人。,"It was as difficult to find corporate land-holding groups among Amazonian people, as the elders who might rule them."
6165,不存在男人群体间交换女人的联姻关系。,There were no groups of men forming ties of alliance through the exchange of their women.
6165,相反，婚姻纽带在亚马逊人的社会结构中是非常突出的，而且更倾向于与胞族而非继嗣的法则相联系。,"Instead, ties of marriage, which were highly salient to Amazonian constructs of sociality, were more likely to be linked to a principle of cognation than descent."
6166,但我们的良知具有社会文化根源，它是超有机体的文化力量作用于个人有机体的产物。,But our conscience has a sociocultural origin; it is the operation of supra-individual cultural forces upon the individual organism.
6166,良知无非是对作用于我们的社会文化力量的经验和意识。,Conscience is merely our experience and our awareness of the operation of certain sociocultural forces upon us.
6166,是非曲直是具有社会文化根源的事物，它们导源于社会制度，而不是个人的生物机体。,"Right and wrong are matters of sociocultural genesis; they are originated by social systems, not by individual biological organisms."
6166,对共同福利有害或被人们认为有害的行为是坏的，而促进共同福利的行为则是好的。,"Behavior that is injurious, or thought to be harmful, to the general welfare is wrong; behavior that promotes the general welfare is good."
6167,他们的父母、袓父、外袓父母因其陈旧观念和生活方式都被排除在外。,"Excluded are parents and grandparents of the cousins, with their older views and lifestyles."
6167,两可系继嗣仍然是首要的组织原则，不过，代的原则已将它改变了。,"Ambilineal descent remains the primary organizing principle, but it has been modified by a generational principle."
6167,除此之外，堂表兄弟姐妹俱乐部在很多方面都与家庭圈有相同的组织和运行方式。,"Otherwise, cousins clubs are organized and function in many of the same ways as family circles."
6168,对实现世界政治统一的抵制力量，在某种程度上似乎被跨国公司的兴起抵消了。,"The world's resistance to political integration seems to be offset, at least partially, by the rise of multinational corporations."
6168,因为这些公司跨越了国界，它们是推进全球整合的力量，尽管有各种政治差异把人们分开。,"Because these cut across the boundaries berween states, they are a force for global unity despite the political differences that divide people."
6168,人类学家非常熟悉这种情形，就像下面这段对祖尼印第安人整合机制的描述那样：四五个不同层面的系统相互交织，因而维持了整个社会的统一性，如果这些不同层面相互融合的话，这种统一性很快就会消失，因而很有可能带来隔离和分裂宗族、兄弟互助会、祭司群体、地下大会堂，在某种意义上还有赌博团伙，都是分化机构。,"Situations such as this are well known to anthropologists, as illustrated by this description of Zuni Indian integrative mechanisms: segregation and fission.The clans, the fraternities, the priesthoods, the kivas, in a measure the gaming parties, are ail dividing agencies."
6168,如果它们相互一致的话，社会结构的裂缝就会很深；通过彼此相互交织，它们制造出各种分支，这些分支造成了一种几乎不可思议的复杂性，但却绝不会导致这个民族实体的分裂。,"If they coincided, the rifts in the social structure would be deep; by countering each other they cause segmentations which produce an almost marvelous complexity, but can never break apart the national entity."
6169,“精神一肉体”的问题与活力论同机械论的争论有关。,"The ""Mind-Body"" problem is of one piece with the Vitalism-Mechanism controversy."
6169,从来没有人能“证明”活力论是错误的，但科学家们和许多哲学家们都认为，应把活力论与作陈腐的、畸形的尤其是贫瘠的理论加以否定的时刻已经来临。,"No one has ever ""disproved"" the theory of Vitalism, but scientists, and many philosophers, are agreed that the time has come when it should be ignored as obsolete, outgrown and, above all, sterile."
6169,这并不是说，机械论哲学就是真理（即是 大写字母的“真理”），而活力论哲学则是谬误；而是说机械论一向是富于成效的，活力论则是不结果实的花朵。,"It is not that the philosophy of Mechanism is True (with a capital T) and that of Vitalism False.It is that Mechanism has been fruitful, productive; Vitalism barren and sterile."
6170,尽管男性的活动被认为比女性的活动更具有声望，但妇女作为生活的支撑者而得到所有人的明确承认和感激。,"Although masculine activities were considered more prestigious than those of women, the latter were explicitly acknowledged by all as the sustainers of life."
6170,而且，妇女是“长屋”（从母居扩大家庭的住所）的家长，继嗣和继承经由女性传递，仪式生活也以女性活动为中心。,"Moreover, women headed the long-houses (dwellings matrilocal extended families occupied), descent and inheritance passed through women，and ceremonial life centered on women's activities."
6170,尽管男子掌握家户之外的所有领导位置，并享有村庄、部落和六族联盟议会中的所有领导位置，但是他们就职却必须由本氏族的妇女提名，而且妇女对他们还有否决权。,"Although men held all leadership positions outside households, on the councils of the villages, tribes, and the league of Five Nations, the women of their lineages nominated them for these positions and held veto power over them."
6170,这样，男性领导权与女性权威均衡。,"Thus, male leadership was balanced by female authority."
6171,从这个印度乡村的社会流动性的概略图中，我们可以看到，有三种等级范畴，各自独立地发挥着部分功能：经济系统、种姓制度和公共行政体系。,"From this sketch of social mobility in an Indian village, we see that there are three scales of rank, functioning partly independently of each other: the economic system, the caste system and public administration."
6171,在各自的体系内部，不同资源风险难料，但是它们全都有权力的分化，通过不同的准则被合法化，并且一部分是不能比较的。,"Different resources are at stake within the respective systems, but all of them entail power differentiation, are legitimated through different principles and are partly incommensurable."
6171,比斯帕拉的婆罗门并不认可潘姓人通过公共行政获得声望的提升；不过，由于在地方政府的攀升，潘姓成员的人变得能够对婆罗门施加某些权力。,"The Brahmins of Bisipara did not recognise the Pan rise to prestige through public administration; however, through climbing in local government, members of the Pan caste became able to exert some power over Brahmins."
6171,还应该注意到，事实证明将经济权力转换成仪式洁净度是有可能的同时，将（公共部门的）政治权力转换成同样的声望是不可能的。,"It should also be noted that while it proved possible to convert economic power into ritual purity, it is not possible to convert political power (in the public sector) into similar prestige."
6171,这似乎是由于贾吉摩尼制度的作用，它联合了经济和仪式的因素，却并没有包括政府部门在内。,"This seems to be caused by the workings of the jajmani system, which combines economic and ritual factors but does not include the state sector."
6172,流言蜚语本质上是一个内在的沟通过程：通过它，个体在一起检验并讨论他们共同生活于其中的规则和习俗。,Gossip is essentially a metacommunicative process: an activity through which individuals examine and discuss together the rules and conventions by which they commonly live.
6172,此外，由于规则在运用中具有相对性和模糊性，这种解释永远都不是最终的解释和合意。,"Moreover, since rules are relative and ambiguous in their application, such interpretation is never final or consensual."
6172,因此，流言蜚语每时每刻都在瓦解、评价、重组日常世界。,"Hence, gossip at once disassembles, evaluates and reconstitutes the everyday world."
6173,正如科科所显示的，一些妇女被官方的美“力”的意识形态所困住，而数十万妇女掉进了硅胶隆胸的陷阱。,"As Coco shows, some women get caught in the official beaLity ideology, and in the case of siliconegel breast implants some hundreds of thousands of women have been ensnared."
6173,"但是，谁受骗以及何时受骗,对理解权力生态学是重要的。妇女接受隆胸手术的平均年龄是36岁，并且通常有两个孩子。","But who gets caught and when is important to an understanding of the ecology of power The average age of a woman having breast implantation is 36 years, and she has an average of two children."
6174,有文献表明，在一起养育的人相互不太有性吸引力，但是“熟悉酿成轻视”的论点可能简单地以结果代替原因。,"It has been documented that human beings raised together have less sexual attraction for one another, but by itself this ""familiarity breeds contempt"" argument simply may substitute the result for the cause."
6174,乱伦禁忌保证一直有密切接触的儿童与其父母避免相互视为性对象。,"The incest taboo ensures that children and their parents, who are constantly in intimate contact, avoid regarding one another as sexual objects."
6174,"除此之外,如果存在对乱伦的本能恐惧，那么我们就会面临很大的困难：解释违犯乱伦禁忌决不是罕见的行为，就像在北美社会发生的那样（在美国10%—14%的18岁以下的儿童涉及乱伦关系），或者解释制度化的乱伦情况，例如，秘鲁估计有印加帝国的首领必须娶他自己的姐妹为妻。","Besides this, if an instinctive horror of incest exists, we would be hard pressed to account for the far from rare violations of the incest taboo, such as occur in North American society (an estimated 10%-14% of children under 18 years of age in the United States have been involved in incestuous relations), or for cases of institutionalized incest, such as requiring the head of the Inca empire in Peru to marry his own sister."
6175,另一个深受欢迎的声明是，所有的人类群体都有乱伦禁忌，所以禁止特定亲族中的婚姻。,Another favorite claim is that all human groups have an incest taboo: a prohibition against marriage among certain classes of relatives.
6175,最后这一声明具有教育意义。,This last claim is instructive in pointing to the kinds of qualifications one must introduce when hazarding generalizations about humankind.
6175,然而，实际上，乱伦禁忌在哪类亲属之间禁止通婚上也是各不相同。,"The incest taboo, for example, varies in terms of which classes of relatives are prohibited mates."
6175,父母和孩子之间以及兄弟姐妹之间的婚姻被广泛禁止，但是表亲婚姻在某些社会不仅是允许的，而且更受喜欢甚或被明文规定下来。,"Mating and marriage between parents and children and among siblings are prohibited widely, but mating among close cousins is not only permitted but preferred or prescribed in certain societies and prohibited in others."
6175,例如，在皇室和精英阶层中，表亲婚姻非常常见，但是，人类学家最感兴趣的风俗是所谓的“母方交表婚”。,"Among the royalty and elite, for example, marriage of cousins is common, but the most interesting custom for anthropologists is that known as ""matrilateral cross-cousin marriage."""
6176,哈金在那些日常的、常识性的和无须运用精确理由的推理，与更为专门化的领域内那些需要精确理由的推理之间作了区别。,"Hacking distinguishes between everyday, commonsensical reasoning that does not need to apply any elaborate set of reasons and those more specialized domains that do."
6176,在这些专门化的领域中以及与它们相关的、具有历史和文化差异性的风格中，同时存在着一种文化和历史的多元件。,There is both a cultural and a historical plurality of these specialized domains and of historically and culturally diverse styles associated with them.
6176,通过对推理、方法和客体的历史风格的多样性的接受，哈金得出结论认为，思想家们频繁地纠正事物、解决问题、确立真理。,"From the acceptance of a diversity of historical styles of reasoning, of methods, and objects, Hacking draws the conclusion that thinkers frequently got things right, solved problems, and established truths."
6176,但是，他指出，这并不意味着我们应当追求一种统一的波普尔式的真理王国，而是像保罗˙费耶阿本德(Paul Feyerabend)那样，我们应尽可能开放地让我们的选择接受探询。问题：表达不通顺改1：我们应尽可能地让我们的选择公开接受质询。,"But, he argues, this does not imply that we should search for a unified Popperian realm of the true; rather, a la Paul Feyerabend, we should keep our options in inquiry as open as possible."
6177,矛盾（和两面性或虚伪一样）可推动有意图的社会效果：取悦选民，迷惑敌人，善待客人，维系友谊，以及侮辱、煽动、误导、神秘化其他人或自己。,"Then again, contradictoriness (as duplicity or hypocrisy) can be employed as a vehicle for all manner of purposive social gain: pleasing an electorate, confusing an enemy, being polite to a guest, keeping in with a friend, insulting, provoking, misleading, mystifying another or oneself."
6177,矛盾的较为文学化的用法会混淆信仰和主张，这种矛盾并不总是不言自明的。,"While between the more and less deliberate uses of contradictions are beliefs and assertions which might be described as vague or fuzzy, such that contradictoriness is not always so self-evident."
6177,沃尔夫勒姆（Wolfram 1985: 72-3）提出，人可以正视等级差异，在清晰和模糊、自证和混淆矛盾之间，个体关系的复杂性可以通过他或她矛盾的表达加以充分分析。,"One can envisage a graded scale, Wolfram suggests (1985:72–3), between blatant and nonblatant, self-evident and fuzzy contradictions, such that the complexity of an individual’s relationship with his or her contradictory representations of self and world is given full analytical measure."
6178,"翁（Ong 1967,1977)以及其他人，对感觉在不同的文化和不同的时代是如何划分等级的事实进行了研究。","Ong (1967, 1977), among others, has studied ways in which the senses are hierarchically ordered in different cultures and epochs."
6178,他认为在西方文字文化中，视觉压倒了声音和触觉、嗅觉、味觉，成为真理的凭据。,"He argues that the truth of vision in Western, literate cultures has predominated over the evidences of sound and interlocution, of touch, smell, and taste."
6178,（玛丽˙普拉特注意到，游记中对气味极为出色的捕捉，在民族志中实际上阙如。,"(Mary Pratt has observed that references to odor, very prominent in travel writing, are virtually absent from ethnographies.)"
6178,）人类学调査中占据优势的方法，是参与观察、数据收集、文化描述，所有这些都预先假定了一个外部立足点——看、对象化，或者更近—点，“阅读”一个给定的现实。约翰尼斯˙费边（Fabian 1983)用翁的作品来批评民族志，他探讨了把文化事实认定为观察到的事情——而不是，比如说听到的、在对话中想象出来的，或转录下来的事情一一的后果。,"The predominant metaphors in anthropological research have been participant-observation, data collection, and cultural description, all of which presuppose a standpoint outside—looking at, objectifying, or, somewhat closer, ""reading,"" a given reality."
6178,接着弗朗西丝˙耶茨（Yates 1960）指出，西方的分类想象本质上是极为视觉至上的，把文化组织得仿佛它们是记忆的剧场，或空间化的阵列。,
6179,描述语言学记录和解释一种语言在其历史上某一特定时期的特点。,Descriptive linguistics registers and explains the features of a language at a particular time in its history.
6179,历史语言学研究同一语言的早期和晚期形式之间的关系。,Historical linguistics investigates relationships between earlier and later forms of the same language.
6179,历史语言学家主要关心的是，辨别在语言趋异过程中语言发生变化背后的力量。,A major concern of historical linguists is to identify the forces behind the changes that have occurred in languages in the course of linguistic divergence.
6179,历史语言学家也提供一种手段，可大体追溯某些民族的迁徙、入侵和接触。,"Historical linguistics also provides a means of roughly dating certain human migrations, invasions, and contacts with other people."
6179,民族语言学研究语言，因为语言与社会、文化的其他部分以及人类行为有关。,"Ethnolinguistics deals with language as it relates to society, the rest of culture, and human behavior."
6180,所有同一性别和同一辈分的亲属都使用同一个称谓。,All relatives of the same generation and sex are referred to by the same term.
6180,英裔美国人使用的爱斯基摩制，强调核心家庭的地位，它把所有其他属于同一辈分的亲属都混入少数笼统的、一般未加分化的范畴之中。,"The Eskimo system, used by Anglo Americans, emphasizes the nuclear family and merges all other relatives in a given generation into a few large, generally undifferentiated categories."
6180,在易洛魁制中，父亲及其兄弟共用同一个称呼，而母亲及其姐妹则共用另一个称呼。,"In the Iroquois system, a single term is used for a father and his brother and another term for a mother and her sister."
6180,平表兄弟姐妹等同于兄弟和姐妹，但却区别于交表兄弟姐妹。,Parallel cousins are equated with brothers and sisters but distinguished from cross cousins.
6180,奥马哈制和克劳制中也一样，但有一点不同，它们把交表兄弟姐妹等同于不同辈分的亲属。,"The same is true in the Omaha and Crow systems, except they equate cross cousins with relatives of other generations."
6180,相对而言，比较少见的苏丹制或描述制，对所有的姑姨婶、叔伯舅、堂表兄弟姐妹以及亲兄弟姐妹都区别对待。,"The relatively rare Sudanese or descriptive system treats all aunts, uncles, cousins, and sib¬lings as different from one another."
6181,在巴西的印第安人日上，总会发生某种死亡仪式。,"As always, on Indian Day in Brazil, a kind of macabre ritual takes place."
6181,"大众媒体谈起原住民“不可避免的灭绝”来,就好像他们是一个正在消失的物种一样。","The mass media talk about the ""inevitable extinction"" of indigenous peoples as if they were a disappearing species."
6181,生态学家和人类学家一再申明：对于地球的未来生存而言，社会的多样性是至关重要的，而原住民也是必要的。,Ecologists and anthropologists reaffirm the vitality of socio-diversity and the necessity of indigenous peoples for the future survival of the planet.
6181,需要改变的，是巴西人关于印第安人和一般少数民族的意识，而非印第安人本身——他们不只是一个曾经伟大的、过去的幸存者或“残留者”，而且完全有能力为他们自己的未来创造可行的发展模式。,"Brazilian consciousness, in relation to Indians and minorities in general, needs to change, not the Indians who have shown that they are not merely ""survivors"" or ""remnants"" of a once great past, but fully capable of forging viable models for their future."
6182,"尽管在贝都因人社会中官方贬低这些诗歌,但它们在人们的日常生活中却发挥着至关重要的作用。","Despite this official devaluation in the male-dominated society of the Bedouins, however, they play a vital part in peoples's daily lives."
6182,个人如果用“短歌”来发表言论和表达感情，那么即使这些言论和感情违反了道德体系，他们也能得到豁免具有悖论意味的是，由于那些唱歌者只和与自己关系亲密的人分享这些“不道德”的情感，并用非个人的传统曲式隐蔽地表达这些情感，这证明他们有一定的控制力，因此也实际上提升了他们的道德声望。,"In their little songs, individuals are shielded from the consequences of making statements and expressing sentiments that contravene the moral system.Paradoxically, by sharing these ""immoral"" sentiments only with intimates and veiling them in impersonal traditional formulas, those who recite rhem demonstrate they have a certain control, which actually enhances their moral standing.As is often true of folklore in general, the a little songs of the Awlad AIi provide a sanctioned outlet for otherwise taboo thoughts or opinions."
6182,就像一般的民俗一样，奥拉德阿利人的“短歌”为那些原本属于禁忌的思想或 观点提供了文化方面恰当的发泄途径。,
6183,倡导从最广义上理解民族科学的先驱是查尔斯•弗雷克 (Charles Frake)。他撰写了一系列关于生态系统、疾病的解释、法律 观念，乃至如何进入一个房子，如何在苏巴南（Subanum)、亚坎 (Yakan)和其他菲律宾文化地区讨要饮料的著作，从中探求了文化的神秘性和世俗性（参见例如Fmke 1980)。,"The foremost proponent of ethnoscience in its broadest sense, Charles Frake, has explored both the esoteric and the mundane in his works on ecological systems, interpretations of illness, concepts of law, how to enter a house, and how to ask for a drink in the Subanum, Yakan, and other cultures of the Philippines (see, e.g., Frake 1980)."
6183,正如这些例子所展示的，弗雷克的民族科学及说明了社会行为，也对民族科学话语的静态范畴进行了说明。,"As these examples show, Frake’s ethnoscience takes social action as well as the static categories of ethnoscientific discourse into account."
6184,虽然民族志的田野工作是民族学的基础，但它不是民族学家的唯一工作。,"Although ethnographic fieldwork is basic to ethnology, it is not the sole occupation of the ethnologist."
6184,民族志的性质大致是描述性的，它为（有较多理论志向的）民族学家提供基础数据，然后民族学家就可能利用这些数据，通过把一种文化的某个特殊方面与其他文化中的相同方面做比较而对它加以研究。,"Largely descriptive in nature, ethnography provides the basic data the ethnologist (who is more theoretically oriented) then may use to study one particular aspect of a culture by comparing it with that same aspect in others."
6184,人类学家始终如一地做这种跨文化比较，这也是该学科的另一个标志。,"Anthropologists constantly make such cross-cultural comparisons, and this is another hallmark of the discipline."
6184,当你比较人们从事于北美人视为“家务”的时间，通过跨文化比较就可能产生对你自己的信念和实践的令人感兴趣的深刻见解。,"Interesting insights into our own practices may come from cross-cultural comparisons, as when one compares the time people devote to what we consider housework."
6185,在考古学界，瑞典学者奥斯卡•蒙特柳斯在19世纪80、90年代，完善了欧洲新石器时代和青铜时代的类型学。,"In archaeology, Swedish writer Oscar Montelius, in the 1880s and 1890s, refined the typology of the European Neolithic and Bronze Ages."
6185,他指出，遍布欧洲的地区变体和细节的细微发展可以被说明是由于传播而不是因为进化 (参见Trigger 1989: 155 -61)。,"He argued that regional variations and specific small developments across Europe could be accounted for by diffusion, rather than by evolution (see Trigger 1989: 155–61)."
6185,在民族学中，事情更加微妙，但是回顾一下历史很重要。摩尔根认为亲属称谓主要依赖于迁移和传播，泰勒也经常谈到传播，并将文化描述为具有“黏附力”（adhesions) 的，或者说文化要素经常在一起被发现。,"In ethnology, things were more subtle, but it is important to recall that Morgan’s thinking about kinship terminologies depended heavily on both migration and diffusion, and Tylor often spoke of diffusion and described cultures as having ‘adhesions’, or elements of culture usually found together."
6186,因为考古学家一般专门研究过去的文化，因此民族学家（ethnologist），或社会文化人类学家，专门研究现在的文化。,"While the archaeologist has traditionally concentrated on past cultures, the ethnologist, or socio-cultural anthropologist, concentrates on present cultures."
6186,与考古学家专注于研究物质实物以了解人的行为不同，民族学家专门研究人们的观念和实践，他们看到它们、经验到它们，甚至与他们将要了解的文化中的那些人讨论这些观念和实践。,"And unlike the archaeologist, who focuses on the study of material objects to learn about human behavior, the ethnologist concentrates on the study of human behavior as it can be seen, experienced, and even discussed with those whose culture is to be understood."
6186,民族学家研究的根基是民族志（ethnography）。,Fundamental to the ethnologist approach is descriptive ethnography.
6186,只要有可能，民族学家就设法生活在他正研究的那些人之中而成为民族志学家。,"Whenever possible, the ethnologist becomes ethnographer by going to live among the people under study."
6187,虽然民族志的田野工作是民族学的基础，但它不是民族学家的唯一工作。,"Although ethnographic fieldwork is basic to ethnology, it is not the sole occupation of the ethnologist."
6187,民族志的性质大致是描述性的，它为（有较多理论志向的）民族学家提供基础数据，然后民族学家就可能利用这些数据，通过把一种文化的某个特殊方面与其他文化中的相同方面做比较而对它加以研究。,"Largely descriptive in nature, ethnography provides the basic data the ethnologist (who is more theoretically oriented) then may use to study one particular aspect of a culture by comparing it with that same aspect in others."
6187,人类学家始终如一地做这种跨文化比较，这也是该学科的另一个标志。,"Anthropologists constantly make such cross-cultural comparisons, and this is another hallmark of the discipline."
6187,当你比较人们从事于北美人视为“家务”的时间，通过跨文化比较就可能产生对你自己的信念和实践的令人感兴趣的深刻见解。,"Interesting insights into our own practices may come from cross-cultural comparisons, as when one compares the time people devote to what we consider housework."
6187,"在美国，普遍的信念是，家用设备消费用品的产出日益增长导致家务持续减少,相应的结果是闲暇时间增加。","In North American society, a widespread belief is that the ever-increasing output of household appliance consumer goods has resulted in a steady reduction in housework, with a consequent increase in leisure time."
6188,矛盾内在于社会文化环境，其现象学方面也开始受到当代民族志的重视（Moore 1987；Ewing 1990；Rapport 1993a，1997c）。,"The contradictoriness inherent within socio-cultural milieux, and its phenomenological appreciation, has also begun to be emphasized in contemporary ethnography (Moore 1987; Ewing 1990; Rapport 1993a, 1997c)."
6188,出现了对矛盾中的人群之间和人群内部的思想、信仰和行为的描述。,"Here is a recounting of contradictory thoughts, beliefs and behaviours both between people and within people."
6188,个体被看作是依附于结构并保持自己多样化的观点，由于各种因素、关系、价值观念、道德理念、渴望和期待等的不同产生矛盾。,"Individuals are seen apt to construct and maintain a diversity of perspectives for themselves, each contradictory in terms of the elements, relationships, values, norms, desires, expectations and so on of all the others."
6189,村委会、多贡人的贺贡或雅诺马马人的头领所发挥的作用，常常包括调停不同利益的家族团体之间的关系。,"The role of the village council and hogon of the Dogon, or the headman of the Yanomamö, often consists of mediating between kin groups with opposing interests."
6189,不过，他们也负责制定“外交政策”。,"However, they are also responsible for foreign policy."
6189,村子以外没有合法的权威，每个村子成为独立的政治单元。,"There is no legitimate authority outside of the village, and each village is thus an independent political unit."
6189,对于村民来说，村子就是宇宙的中心。,"To the villagers, the village is the centre of the universe."
6189,家庭、生计、童年回忆、身体防御和将来都在于此。,"Family, livelihood, childhood memories, physical protection and future all lie there."
6189,（我们应该记住，这里的时态是民族志的现在时。事实上，今天的多贡人和雅诺马马人不可避免都会受到国家和世界资本主义的影响。）,(Here we should keep in mind that the tense is the ethnographic present. Neither the Dogon nor the Yanomamö are today unaffected by the state and world capitalism.)
6190,欧洲中心主义的话语，诞生于对等级体系全面的支配性的编造之中，成为其人性观念的至高意识。,"The Eurocentric discourse, born within a hegemonic and totalizing rhetoric of hierarchy, is deeply exclusive in its view of humanity."
6190,它只允许把征服者单独看待，相反，亚马逊土著人的民族中心主义观念其实可理解为建立在平等的基础上，其对相异性的表述更多的是与自身对人性的分类相容的。,"It allows might to the conquerors alone.In contrast, the ethnocentrism of indigenous Amazonian discourse can best be understood as being based upon a rhetoric of equality, and its expressions of alterity are much more inclusive in its categorization of humanity."
6190,此时，并不只给自己赋予权力。,Here power does not accrue to self alone.
6191,这表明在实践中，主观判断仍将是比较正确的，而且欲取得国家地位，在多数情况下，其代价仍将是冲突和流血。,"That suggests that, in practice, might will continue to be the better part of right, and the price of statehood will continue, in most cases, to be conflict and bloodshed."
6191,这样一个结论与亚当·罗伯茨（Adam Roberts)对民族自决的整体概念所做的剖析不谋而合，而该剖析是细心、多疑的，但并非说是专横的。,"Such a conclusion fits well with Adam Roberts's careful and sceptical, not to say magisterial, dissection of the whole concept of national self-determination."
6191,罗伯茨反对任何过于整齐划一和系统安排民族与国家之间关系的企图。,Roberts rightly warns against any attempt to be too tidy or systematic in organising the relationship between nations and states.
6192,事实上，我即将论证，它是作为一种写作，尤其是作为文本化的过程被添造进民族志的构思和实践中的。,"Indeed, I shall argue in a moment that it is built into the conception and practice of ethnography as a process of writing, specifically of textualization."
6192,每一种将自己设想成“让文化变成写作”的描述或解释，从口头上东拉西扯的经验（“本地人”，的田野工作者的）发展到这种经验的完成版本（民族志文本），都在制定着“抢救”的结构。,"Every description or interpretation that conceives itself as ""bringing a culture into writing,""moving from oral-discursive experience (the ""native's,"" the fieldworker's) to a written version of that experience (the ethnographic text) is enacting the structure of ""salvage."""
6192,从民族志过程被视为铭写（而不是，例如抄写或对话）的角度看，表述将继续制定一种有效的、有问题的、寓言性的结构。,"To the extent that the ethnographic process is seen as inscription (rather than, for example as transcription, or dialogue) the representation will continue to enact a potent, and questionable, allegorical structure."
6193,在1931年，埃文思-普里查德又进行了一次尝试，发现人们甚至比上次更加充满敌意。,In 1931 Evans-Pritchard tries again and finds people even more hostile than before.
6193,然而他又乐得有一个被接受的时期：“我终于开始感觉到自己是这个社区的一个成员，而人们也是这样接受我的，(第13页）当他受到一场疟疾的侵害的时候，他的牧歌式的插曲又一次突然中断了。,"He nonetheless again enjoys a period of acceptance: ""I at last began to feel myself a member of the community and to be accepted as such"" (13).Once again his pastoral interlude ends abruptly when he falls to an attack of malaria."
6193,他在1935年和1936年的远征调査各自持续了七周左右，都是因为严重的疾病而不得不停止下来。,"His 1935 and 1936 expeditions each last about seven weeks, and both draw to a halt because of serious illness."
6193,作为叙述者的埃文思-普里查德把他自己这个田野工作者描述成在最严峻的环境里能够平和地表现自己的精神的男子。,Evans-Pritchard the narrator depicts himself the fieldworker as a man endowed with calm presence of mind under the most arduous conditions.
6193,他不用假设说话，还会取笑这个田野工作者。,He speaks without presumption and pokes fun at the fieldworker.
6193,问题：表达不符汉语习惯改1：比上次敌意更强。,
6193,然而他又经历了一段被接受的时期,
6194,石刻刀——有像凿子—样刀口的工具——虽然是由穆斯捷工具制造者较早发明的，但是在旧石器时代晚期却是常用工具。,"The burin — a stone tool with chisel-like edges—although invented earlier by Mousterian tool-makers, came into common use in the Upper Paleolithic."
6194,石刻刀提供了雕刻骨头和鹿角的出色手段，把骨头和鹿角加工成为诸如鱼钩和鱼叉那样的工具。,"The burin provided an excellent means of carving bone and antler, used for tools such as fishhooks and harpoons."
6194,梭镖投射器是一种在顶端装上钩状物用来投射梭镙的木制器具。,"The atlatl, which consisted of a piece of wood with a groove in it for holding and throwing a spear, also appeared at this time."
6194,借助梭镖投射器，猎人增加了梭镖发射后的力量弓箭可以说超出了这种梭镖投射器。,"With the atlatl, hunters increased the force behind the spear throw.The bow and arrow went even beyond this."
6194,弓弦增加了箭枝的发射力量，能使它射得比梭镖更远，且具有更大的效力，甚至在借助于梭镖投射器发射梭镖时也是这样。,"The bowstring increased the force on the arrow, enabling it to travel farther and with greater effectiveness than a spear thrown with an atlatl."
6195,虽然这种活动可能强化个体之间的社会联系，但性接触权的竞争也有破坏性，因此，任何社会都有控制性接触的规则。,"Although such activity may reinforce social bonds between men and women, competition for sexual access also can be disruptive, so every society has rules that govern such access."
6195,乱伦禁忌几乎是普遍的，它禁止父母与其子女之间的性关系，通常也禁止同胞兄弟姐妹之间的性关系。长期以来，人类学家一直对乱伦禁忌有兴趣，但是还没有提出对禁忌的真正令人信服的解释。,"The near universality of the incest taboo, which forbids sexual relations between parents and their children, and usually between siblings, long has interested anthropologists, but a truly convincing explanation of the taboo has yet to be advanced."
6195,与乱伦有关的是内婚制和外婚制的习俗。,Related to incest are the practices of endogamy and exogamy.
6195,内婚制是在一群人内部结婚；外婚制是在群体外结婚。,Endogamy is marriage within a group of individuals; exogamy is marriage outside the group.
6195,如果群体限于直系家庭，那么几乎所有社会都禁止内婚制而实行外婚制。,"If the group is limited to the immediate family, almost all societies can be said to prohibit endogamy and practice exogamy."
6196,尽管有所差异，在实证主义和阐释模型之间还是有很多相同之处。,"Despite their differences, the positivist and interpretive models have much in common."
6196,两者都是经验主义地运作——观察世界上发生的事情——而不是仅仅通过内省。,Both work empirically – observing events in the world – rather than solely through introspection.
6196,两者都是系统化地进行推断，而不是限制自己对文艺或诗艺的召唤。,Both systematize and generalize rather than confine themselves to literary or poetic evocation.
6196,两者都包括主观性和客观性，毕竟是分析员在做分析；那里不存在独立于分析员的数据。,"Both entail subjectivity as well as objectivity because, after all, it is the analyst who does analysis; there exists no body of data independent of the analyst."
6196,最后，两者都是缜密的和精确的。,"Finally, both can be meticulous and precise."
6197,的确，对许多人来说，这好象根本没有作出说明，在较早的年代里，依据恒星与行星自身而不是神灵的意志和怪想来解释这些星球的运动，似乎是空洞无物的。,"To many, no doubt, this will seem like no explanation at all.In an earlier day it may have seemed empty to explain the behavior of stars and planets in terms of stars and planets instead of the will and whim of spiritual beings."
6197,但是在今天的物理学和生物学中，用非泛灵论与非拟人论术语来说明事件，巳经完全确立起来。,But the explanation of events in non-animistic and non-anthropomorphic terms is now well established in the physical and biological sciences.
6197,唯独在社会科学中，仍然保存了不少拟人论的痕迹。,We still retain more than a vestige of anthropomorphism in the social sciences.
6198,在一些社会中，年龄等级又分为年龄组（Uge sets)(有时被称为年龄级）。,"In some societies, age grades are subdivided into age sets."
6198,一个年龄组是一群加入同一个年龄等级，并一起经历该等级的人。,An age set is a group of persons initiated into an age grade who move through the system together.
6198,例如，在东非的蒂里基人中，由在15年期间被归入一个年龄组而加入一个年龄等级的那些人构成年龄群体年龄组与年龄等级不同，它不会在经过一定的年数之后就停止存在：一个年龄组的成员通常在他们的一生尚中彼此都保持密切的联系，或者至少在其一生大部分时间如此。,"For example, among the Tiriki of East Africa, the age group consisting of those initiated into an age grade for a 15-year period amounts to an age set.Age sets, unlike age grades, do not cease to exist after a specified number of years; the members of an age set usually remain closely associated throughout their lives, or at least through much of their lives."
6199,答案看来存在于农业革命所确立的社会经济系统与技术系统的关系之中。,The answer seems to lie in the relationship between socio- economic system and technological system established by the Agricultural Revolution.
6199,如我们已指出的，每一社会系统皆依赖和取决于技术系统。,"As we have noted, every social system rests upon and is determined by a technological system."
6199,但每一技术系统都在社会系统发挥功能，因此又受社会系统的制约。,But every technological system functions within a social system and is therefore conditioned by it.
6199,为农业革命所创立的社会系统作用于技术过程，以便最终“容纳它”，并且实际上进而使整个文化进步陷于迟滞。这就是农业技术如何陷于迟滞的情状。,"The social system created by the Agricultural Revolution affected the technological process so as eventually to ""contain it"" and to bring further progress in culture as a whole virtually to a standstill.This is how it was done."
6200,奴隶制下的性堕落将被忘记，婚姻受到鼓励，家庭生活受到赞美。,"The sexual depravities of slavery would be forgotten, marriages encouraged,family life celebrated."
6200,整齐而粉饰一新的村舍将变成幸福和孝行的场所。,
6200,男人就像男人一样行为，独立、承认劳动神圣、管教妻子待在家里和照顾孩子。,
6200,真正的自由建立在对房屋的所有权上，它可以阻止贪婪的种植园主榨取额外的租金或非人地对待佃户。,
6200,问题：错译改1：奴隶制下的性堕落将被忘记，婚姻受到鼓励，家庭生活受到赞美。,
6200,整齐而粉饰一新的村舍将变成幸福和孝行的场所。,Neat white-washed cottages would become places of happiness and nurseries of piety.
6200,人们敦促男人像男人一样做事，独立、承认劳动神圣、命令妻子待在家里和照顾孩子。,"Men were urged to act as men, to be independent, to recognise the dignity of labour, to command their wives to stay at home and look after the children."
6200,真正的自由建立在对房屋的所有权上，它可以阻止贪婪的种植园主榨取额外的租金或非人地对待佃户。,"Real freedom depended on the ownership of houses, which prevented prying planters from charging exorbitant rents or treating tenants in unmanly ways."
6201,其中，因为田野调查，而且因为对于非欧洲社会的定位，人类学贡献了重要的洞见，比如，它认为“现代性”和“传统”并不是相互排斥的，而这与马克斯·韦伯和其他早期现代性理论家所持的观点正相反。,"Because of fieldwork, and because of its orientation towards non-European societies, anthropology has contributed important insights to the effect that ""modernity"" and ""tradition"" are not mutually exclusive, contrary to what Max Weber and other early theorists of modernity held."
6201,现代政治、为工资工作和现代化政府可以很好地与祖先崇拜和家系组织并存，尽管在如此复杂的社会中，一定会有各种紧张和矛盾存在。,"Modern politics, wagework and a modern state may well exist side by side with ancestral cults and lineage organisation, although there are bound to be tensions and contradictions within such complex societies."
6201,它还说明了，生活在“现代”社会中的人可以保留重要的“传统”特征，例如，裙带关系和道德排他主义、社区层面上的社会内聚力和从处女生子到巫术等各种宗教信仰。,"It has also been shown that people who live in ""modern"" societies can retain important ""traditional"" characteristics, such as, for example, nepotism and moral particularism, social cohesion at the community level and a wide range of religious beliefs ranging from virgin birth to sorcery."
6201,与此同时，毫无疑问的是，现代化带来了无可挽回的社会和文化变化。,"At the same time, there is no doubt that modernisation entails irreversible social and cultural change."
6202,就如在特罗布里恩德岛民中那样，在许多人类社会中的婚姻都是由某种类型的经济交换肯定下来的。,"As among the Trobriand Islanders, marriages in many human societies are formalized by some sort of economic exchange."
6202,在特罗布里恩德人中，就如前面所述，它采取了礼物交换的形式。,"Among the Trobrianders, this takes the form of a gift exchange, as just described."
6202,更常见的是聘礼，有时也叫彩礼。,
6202,,"Far more common is bride-price, sometimes called bride wealth."
6203,此外，还有失业者、罪犯、流浪者等组成的流氓无产阶级，同时，还存在一个贵族阶级，其成员依靠财产的利息生活。,"In addition, there are lumpenproletariats of unemployed, criminals, vagrants, etc., as well as an aristocracy whose members live off the interest from property."
6203,毫无疑问，即使是在那些强调平等的社会里，人们之间也存在着系统的等级差异。,There are doubtless great systematic rank differences between people even in societies where equality is emphasised.
6203,实际上，阶级差异倾向于被一代一代地复制下去，所以孩子们会继承其父母的阶级身份，尽管一直都存在着一定的社会流动性。,"In practice, class differences tend to be reproduced over the generations, so that children take on their parents' class membership, although there is always a certain social mobility."
6203,不论这些差异是否必然地与拥有生产手段相联系，从系统的视角和以行动者为中心的视角来说，它们都是极其重要的。,"Whether or not such differences are necessarily connected with ownership of means of production, they are very important from a systemic as well as an actor-centred perspective."
6203,但是，应该注意到，大部分社会科学家所支持的一种有关不平等的思考方式都与马克思主义相反，他们不把经济财产作为优先的解释变量。,"It should nevertheless be noted that the majority of social scientists support a way of thinking about inequality which, contrary to Marxism, does not give priority to economic property as an explanatory variable."
6204,斯科特拉普人居住在芬兰北部地区，传统上靠打渔和饲养驯鹿为生。,"The Skolt Lapps, whose homeland is in northern Finland, traditionally supported themselves by fishing and herding reindeer."
6204,尽管他们在某些物质产品上要依靠外部世界，但当地拥有对他们的系统至关重要的资源，所有的人实际上都可利用这些资源。,"Although they depended on the outside world for certain material goods, the resources crucial for their system were found locally and were for all practical purposes available to all."
6204,关键性的资源每个人都可以得到，在人与人之间几乎不存在社会和经济分化。,"No one was denied access to critical resources, and little social and economic differentiation existed among the people."
6204,他们的社会基本上是平等社会。,Theirs was basically an egalitarian society.
6204,放牧驯鹿对于斯科特拉普人是特别重要的。,Of particular importance to the Skolt Lapps was reindeer herding.
6204,的确，鹿群管理対于他们把自己定义为一个民族是至关重要的。,"Indeed, herd management is central to their definition of themselves as a people."
6205,在历史上，妇女很少担任重要的政治领导职位，而当她们担任的时候，有时因为缺少合格男子承担这一职位。,"Historically women rarely have held important positions of political leadership, and when they have, it sometimes has been for lack of a qualified man to hold the position."
6205,然而，在一些社会中，妇女一直以来都与男子享有政治上的平等，例如，在纽约州的易洛魁部落就是这样。,"Nonetheless, in a number of societies, women have enjoyed political equality with men, as among the Iroquoian tribes of New York State."
6205,在他们那里，妇女很乐意让男子拥有职权，因为她们不仅有权任命他们，而且也有权把他们撤掉。,"In these tribes, all men held office at the pleasure of women, who not only appointed them but could remove them as well."
6205,在尼日利 亚中西部的伊格博人中，妇女和男子各拥有一个行政等级制度，这两个制度相互平行和制衡。,"Among the Igbo of midwestern Nigeria, women held positions in an administrative hierarchy that paralleled and balanced that of the men."
6205,在集权化的政治制度下，妇女最易于从属于男子，当国象把控制强加在男女平等的社会之上的时候，这种性别关系就会发生改变，即男人统治女人。,"Under centralized political systems, women are most apt to be subordinate to men, and when states impose their control on societies marked by sexual egalitarianism, the relationship changes so that men dominate women."
6206,在群体内发生的交换一般采取泛化互惠或平衡互惠的形式。,Exchanges that occur within a group of people generally take the form of generalized or balanced reciprocity.
6206,当交换在两个群体之间进行时，就可能有敌对和竞争的倾向。因此，这类交换可能采取消极互惠的形式，除非人们做好某种安排，确保交换大致接近于平衡。,"When they occur between two groups, at least a potential for hostility and competition is apt to exist.Therefore, such exchanges may well take the form of negative reciprocity, unless some sort of arrangement has been made to ensure at least an approach to balance."
6206,物物交换是消极互惠的一种形式，通过这种交换，一个群体的稀缺物品与另一个群体的合意物品相交换。,"Barter is one form of negative reciprocity, involving the exchange of scarce items from one group for desirable goods from another group."
6206,交换时要计算相对价值，尽管双方外表上满不在乎，与一个群体内部交换更加平衡的性质相比，精明的交换更是惯例。,"Relative value is calculated, and despite an outward show of indifference, sharp trading is more the rule, when compared to the more balanced nature of exchanges within a group."
6207,由于通过民族志学方法可以获取丰富的知识，它有时被誉为是一个发现意义和洞见的极好方式。,"Owing to the richness of learning acquired through the ethnographic method, it is sometimes touted as an excellent way to discover meanings and gain insights."
6207,不过作为一种核实（或反驳）理论的方式它也受到质疑，因为它所抽样的仅是一个大群体中的一小部分。,"It is also doubted as a way of verifying (or refuting) theories, because it samples only a small segment of a population."
6207,一燕不成夏，对一个小群体的详细分析不会证明一个普遍原则。,"A swallow does not make a summer, and detailed analysis of a small group does not prove a universal principle."
6207,不过，一个详细的研究可以强有力地质疑普遍原则的宣称，并有可能创造性地提出洞见，丰富这一理论。,"A detailed study can, however, forcefully call into question claims of universal theory and can creatively suggest insights to enrich such theory."
6208,有不少学者时常认为，19世纪早期是人类学史上相对沉闷的年代。,It is often said that the early nineteenth century was an era of little interest to historians of anthropology.
6208,那些视18世纪启蒙运动为我们时代的科学之晨曦的人们将19世纪早期看作是一种倒退。,Those who might point to the eighteenth-century Enlightenment as the dawn of our science regard the early nineteenth century as a step backwards.
6208,那些认为学科始于19世纪晚期的人们则认为19世纪前半期是人类学基本原则尚未被广泛接受的时期。,Those who would begin in the late nineteenth century regard the earlier part of that century as an age before anthropology’s basic principles came to be accepted.
6209,毫不意外，作为一名女性主义者，斯特拉森批判了与上述故事相一致的人类学的社会性概念，其中社会被隐喻性地划分为男性的领域。,"It is hardly surprising that Strathern, as feminist, critiques anthropological perceptions of sociality when they coincide with the above story of society.In it society is seen as a domain that is metaphorically categorized as male."
6209,社会被看作是可调节范围更大的社会性；它等同于男人的公共领域，聚集起全体男人为社会负责。,"Society is understood as a wider regulating sociality; it is equated with the public domain of men, who form together a collectivity of men responsible for society."
6209,这与女人的个性化的、家庭的行为形成了鲜明的对比，后者被看作男人的、乃至整个社会的“难题”，它们威胁和冲击了全体男性之间的团结（cf.,"This is to be contrasted to women’s individuating, domestic activities which are viewed as ‘the problem’ for men, and thus for society at large, in that they threaten and impinge upon the solidarity of the collectivity of males (cf."
6209,"Pateman （1989: 641））,此人评述说，卢梭式的社会契约只是针对男人的，女人不但被排除在外，而且被看作是对运行良好的社会的持续威胁）。","Pateman (1989:641) who observes that the Rousseau-esque social contract is for men only, with women being seen not just as excluded from it but a continual danger to society’s orderly running)."
6210,这意味着破坏人们的身份认同，即对他们是谁以及他们如何看待自己加以破坏。,"This means destroying people's identities, who they are and how they perceive themselves."
6210,强奸在这样一个战略中是一个潜在的武器。,Rape can be a potent weapon in such a strategy.17
6210,瑞纳塔·萨利科（Renata Salecl）将这一论点推进一步，指出战争的目的是破坏整个民族幻想的结构。民族神话的形成与某些作为民族存在象征的神圣的领土有关。,"Renata Salecl pushes this argument further and suggests that the aim of war is to destroy the fantasy structure of a whole population.National myths are constructed about certain territories which become sacred, symbolic of the nation's existence."
6210,对民族幻想的破坏通过对身体的真实伤害来实现。,The destruction of the fantasy of the nation occurs through inflicting real injuries on bodies.
6211,由于亲类的结构是双边的，所以除同胞兄弟姐妹之外，一个亲类对任意两个人来说，从来不会是相同的。,"Because of its bilateral structure, a kindred is never the same for any two persons except siblings (brothers and sisters)."
6211,因此，没有哪两个人（除同胞兄弟姐妹之外）属于同一个亲类。,"Thus, no two people (except siblings) belong to the same kindred."
6211,例如，“自我”的父亲这一方的第一代堂表兄弟姐妹的亲类，不仅包括父亲的姐妹（或兄弟），就像“自我”的亲类也包括她们（他们）一样，还包括父亲姐妹（或兄弟）的配偶，以及与这些配偶有血缘关系的亲戚。,"The kindred of ego's first cousin on the father's side, for example, includes not only the father's sister (or brother)，as does ego's, but the father's sister's (or brother's) spouse, as well as consanguineai relatives of the latter."
6211,至于“自我”父母的亲类，它们从直系向上可以延伸到祖父母外祖父母，向旁系可以延伸到远得连“自我”都不认识的堂表兄弟姐妹。同样，“自我”的叔伯舅姑姨们的亲类也是如此。,"As for the kindreds of ego's parents, these range from grandparents lineally to cousins too distant laterally for ego to know, and the same is true of ego's aunts and uncles."
6212,是什么方面使得亲属制度如此重要？,What is it about kinship that makes it so important?
6212,简单的回答是，正是在许多社会中，亲属制度是单个的最重要的社会制度。,The simple answer is that in very many societies kinship is the single most important social institution.
6212,在许多例子中，家族照顾了人的生计、职业、婚姻、防护和社会身份。,"The kin group, in many cases, takes care of one's livelihood, one's career, one's marriage, one's protection and one's social identity."
6212,第四章首次探讨亲属制度重要性，并且简要指出了在亲属制度系统和社会组织的其他方面之间有一种密切的相互关系。,"Chapter 4 offered a first glimpse of the importance of kinship, and indicated that there is a close interrelationship between the kinship system and other aspects of social organisation."
6212,在某些例子中，人类学家对亲属制度系统的描绘可能实际上和社会组织并存，因为社会的成员及其大部分活动，可能首要地是根据亲属制度原则而被组织起来的。,"In some cases, what anthropologists delineate as the kinship system may indeed be coexistent with social organisation, since the members of society, and most of their activities, may first and foremost be organised along kinship principles."
6213,失范是一种真实的威胁，因为候选人是第一次能够从外部去观察他们自己和社会，并且也许会对此进行批评的反思。,"Anomie is a real threat, as the candidates are for the first time able to see themselves and society from the outside, and perhaps reflect critically on it."
6213,或许，如今现代社会中具有代表性的被拉长的青春期，可以被理解为一个漫长的过渡仪式。,"Perhaps, indeed, the extended adolescence typical of contemporary modern societies may fruitfully be seen as a very long rite of passage."
6213,迄今为止，社会人的发展一直被描述为一种个人和社会之间的互动。,"So far, the development of the social person has been described as an interplay between individual and society."
6213,我们现在更深入了一步，转向了大众的社会组织，着眼于谁和什么人一起做什么事，以及社会是如何随着时间维持（和变化）的。,"We now move a step further and turn towards the social organisation of communities, looking at who does what with whom, and how societies are maintained (and change) through time."
6214,酋邦(chiedoms)是两个或多个地方群体在单个统治者——酋长——之下借以组织起来的区域政治机构，酋长在人们的等级体系中列首位。,A chiefdom is a regional polity in which two or more local groups are organized under a single ruling individual—the chief—who is at the head of a ranked hierarchy of people.
6214,一个个体与酋长关系的亲密程度决定他或她在这种政治机构中的地位。,An individuaPs status in such a polity is determined by his or her closeness of relationship to the chief.
6214,那些与酋长最亲密的人在官方地位等级中居高位，而且那些处于较低等级者对他们毕恭毕敬。,Those closest are officially superior and receive deferential treatment from those in lower ranks.
6214,酋长的职务通常是终生的，而且往往是世袭的，由一个男子传给他自己的儿子或者他姐妹的儿子，这取决于继嗣是根据父系的还是根据母系而定。,"The office of the chief is usually hereditary, passing from a man to his own or his sister's son, depending on whether descent is reckoned patrilineally or matrilineally."
6214,与队群和部里的头人不同，酋长一般是真正的掌权者，在任何时候，在任何事务上，他的权威能够把他的人民团结起来。,"Unlike the headmen in bands and lineages, the chief is generally a true authority figure, and his authority serves to unite his people in all affairs and at all times."
6215,"德里达认为把全部文本作为分析单位是荒谬的（例如 Derrida 1976[1967];1978[1967]), 在这一点上他的思想与结构主义产生分歧。","Derrida (e.g., 1976 [1967]; 1978 [1967]) broke with structuralism in an attempt to expose what he saw as the fallacy of any analysis which accepts the totality of a text as a unit of analysis."
6215,他声称任何文本都离不开矛盾。,"Any text, he argues, will entail contradictions."
6215,索绪尔的“差异”（后索绪尔结构主义者用来说明有区分的特征或二元对抗）观念被转化成一个复杂的概念，其中既有“差异”（来自法语的différence，即“差异”) ，又有“服从”（来自法语的différance [sic]，是德里达为这一现象杜撰的新词）的意思。,"The Saussurian notion of ‘difference’ (referred to by post-Saussurian structuralists in terms of distinctive features or binary oppositions) is transformed into a complex concept where meaning is both ‘different’ (through différence, ‘difference’) and ‘deferred’ (through différance [sic], Derrida’s neologism for this phenomenon)."
6216,下面一点很快就变得明显：没有一个“完整的”第一时间知识大全，没有人——最不可能的是来访的民族志学者——能够了解这一知识，除非通过一系列偶然的、饱含权力关系、结局开放的遭遇。,"It soon becomes apparent that there is no ""complete"" corpus of First-Time knowledge, that no one—least of all the visiting ethnographer — can know this lore except through an open-ended series of contingent, power-laden encounters."
6216,“人们公认不同的萨拉马卡历史学家有不同版本的历史，而听者为自己拼凑起关于某一事件的他暂时愿意接受的版本”（Price 1983:28)。,"""It is accepted that different Saramaka historians will have different versions, and it is up to the listener to piece together for himself the version of an event that he, for the time being, accepts"" (28)."
6216,尽管普赖斯，一个小心谨慎的田野工作者和历史学家，带着写作的武器，聚拢了一个其内容超过任何个人所知或所说的文本，这一文本“仍然只代表了萨拉马卡人集体保存的关于第一时间知识的冰山一角”(Price 1983：25）。,"Though Price, the scrupulous fieldworker and historian, armed with writing, has gathered a text that surpasses in extent what individuals know or tell, it still ""represents only the tip of the iceberg that Saramakas collectively preserve about First-Time"" (25)."
6217,,"If the world is conceived of as having certain classes of being, then this is because society has such classes (houses, lineages, status groups, say)."
6217,如果社会按照空间和时间划分，那是因为社会存在这些划分（例如住所、年度节庆、同龄人）。,"If the world is conceived of in terms of divisions of space and time, then this is because society has such divisions (between habitations, between annual festivities, between agegrades)."
6217,如果社会针对一定的关系和一定的力量划分成某些部分，那也是因为社会中固有这些关系和力量（例如等级、因果、权力和权威）。,"And if the world is conceived of as party or prey to certain relations and certain forces, then this is because society is home to relations and forces too (hierarchy, cause-and-effect, power and authority)."
6217,对于涂尔干和莫斯来说，社会就是逻辑分类的一个基本典范，并且这一分类体系（例如科学）正逐渐从社会现实、社会功能和社会需要中分离出来。,"For Durkheim and Mauss, in sum, society was the elemental model for logical classification, and only gradually did such schemata come to dissociate themselves (for example, science) from social realities, social functions and social needs."
6218,他提出相对论的问题是是否只有一个世界，但普遍性行为的问题在哲学上是不同的。,"Essentially, he says that the problem of relativism is whether there is only one world, whereas the problem of universals is philosophically different."
6218,而且，对普遍性行为的研究本身也不是一种普遍的行为，而是具有文化特殊性的（例如，不是所有民族都进行这种研究，但是这本书的读者也许在进行这种研究）。,"Moreover, the search for universals is itself not a universal but is culturally specific (it is found not among all peoples, but, for example, among the sort of people who might read this book)."
6218,但是这一研究可以影响所有的人，而且这种影响（今天的理论家称之为“全球化”）已经在发挥作用。,"Yet such a search is accessible to all human beings, and its diffusion (present-day theorists would say ‘globalization’) is taking place."
6219,其中，因为田野调查，而且因为对于非欧洲社会的定位，人类学贡献了重要的洞见，比如，它认为“现代性”和“传统”并不是相互排斥的，而这与马克斯·韦伯和其他早期现代性理论家所持的观点正相反。,"Because of fieldwork, and because of its orientation towards non-European societies, anthropology has contributed important insights to the effect that ""modernity"" and ""tradition"" are not mutually exclusive, contrary to what Max Weber and other early theorists of modernity held."
6219,现代政治、为工资工作和现代化政府可以很好地与祖先崇拜和家系组织并存，尽管在如此复杂的社会中，一定会有各种紧张和矛盾存在。,"Modern politics, wagework and a modern state may well exist side by side with ancestral cults and lineage organisation, although there are bound to be tensions and contradictions within such complex societies."
6219,它还说明了，生活在“现代”社会中的人可以保留重要的“传统”特征，例如，裙带关系和道德排他主义、社区层面上的社会内聚力和从处女生子到巫术等各种宗教信仰。,"It has also been shown that people who live in ""modern"" societies can retain important ""traditional"" characteristics, such as, for example, nepotism and moral particularism, social cohesion at the community level and a wide range of religious beliefs ranging from virgin birth to sorcery."
6219,与此同时，毫无疑问的是，现代化带来了无可挽回的社会和文化变化。,"At the same time, there is no doubt that modernisation entails irreversible social and cultural change."
6220,她是低格栅值，因为她的群体是平等的、民主的。,She is in a low-grid situation because her group is egalitarian and democratic.
6220,与艾丽斯不同，她还是高群值，是一个受团体多种限制的人。,"Unlike Alice, she is also in a high-group situation, one full of group-oriented constraints."
6220,艾丽斯属于许多社团。,Alice belongs to lots of different societies.
6220,德博拉只属于她的团队性很强的系。,Deborah only belongs to her strongly group-oriented department.
6220,像卡洛斯一样，她花许多时间参与系里的活动，无论这个群体（她的系）想做什么，其中的每个人都会去做。,"Like Carlos, she spends lots of time in departmental activities, and whatever the group (her department) all want to do, everyone does."
6221,典型人格概念尽管有许多可取之处，但是它作为研究群体人格的一种手段仍然显出一些困难。,"While having much to recommend it, the concept of modal personality as a means of dealing with group personality nevertheless presents certain difficulties."
6221,其中一个困难是测量技术的复杂性，它难于在田野里实施。,"One of these is the complexity of the measurement techniques, which may be difficult to implement in the field."
6221,因为，其一，必须有关于主题的适当的代表性样本。,"For one, an adequate representative sample of subjects is necessary."
6221,这一问题在这里有两重性：要确保样本有真正的代表性，以及要有必要时间和人员来实施测验、进行访谈等等，所有这些都可能是漫长的过程。,"The problem here is twofold: making sure the sample is genuinely representative and having the time and personnel necessary to administer the tests, conduct interviews, and so on, all of which can be lengthy proceedings."
6221,而且测验本身也构成了问题，因为在一种文化背景中设计出来的测验可能不适合于另一种文化背景。,"Also, the tests themselves constitute a problem, for those devised for one cultural setting may not be appropriate for another."
6222,如果角色分析所提供的工具是普遍适用的——放之四海而皆准——它们也仅只是提供了一个起始点，如果目标是理解各种社会和文化系统的差异和雷同的话。,If the tools provided by role analysis are universally applicable – can be useful in the study of any society – they provide a mere starting-point if the goal is an understanding of differences as well as similarities between social and cultural systems.
6222,人类学家常常认为某些民族的人缺少私人角色（或我们也可以说，个人身份）的观念。,"It has often been argued by anthropologists that some peoples lack a concept of the private persona (or, as we might put it, of personal identity)."
6222,可以肯定地说，人格的公共方面和私人方面在不同的社会里有很大的差异。,"At the very least, it is certain that the relationship between private and public aspects of personhood varies greatly between societies."
6222,即使在文化相对同质的各个西欧和北美的社会，都有着重要的不同，许多欧洲人被北美人对陌生人谈及他们的私生活时的轻松自如所震惊。,"Even in the comparatively culturally homogeneous Western European and North American societies, there are important variations.Many Europeans are shocked at the ease with which North Americans may speak about their private lives to strangers."
6222,如果我们更深入地探究，会发现差异更加深刻。,"If we move further afield, the differences become more profound."
6223,在理解现在所称的“全球化”这一进程中，什么是人类学潜在的或可能的角色？,"What is anthropology's potential role in understanding the processes now called ""globalization""?"
6223,在19世纪晚期及20世纪早期，极少有其他学科关注第一世界之外的人类生活。,"In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, very few other disciplines were concerned with human life outside of the first world."
6223,尽管在这一时期殖民主义是一个进取的或者也可说是富有攻击性的政治与经济力量，但对殖民地人们的学术研究则主要落到一个学科身上，即人类学。,"Although colonialism was an aggressive political and economic force during this period, academic study of the people in the colonies fell primarily to one discipline, anthropology."
6223,现在，当其他学术领域发现了一个相互连接的地球这一思想来进行研究并从中获益时，人类学对非西方文化研究的独一无二的所有权也就受到了挑战。,"Now, when other academic fieldsfindthe idea of an interconnected globe to hold promise for study and profit, anthropology's unique claim on the study of non-Western cultures is challenged."
6224,人类学作为一个整体（即包括生物人类学也包括文化人类学）保持着对两个相当不同的问题的长期关注：人性的理解和文化多样性的研究。,Anthropology as a whole (including biological as well as cultural anthropology) retains a long-standing concern with two quite different problems: the understanding of human nature and the study of cultural diversity.
6224,在18 世纪的启蒙运动中，人性的理解是主要的兴趣。,In the eighteenth-century Enlightenment the former was the main interest.
6224,19 世纪，随着人类学特有的发展，文化多样性在多元起源论者手中变得凸现起来。,"With the development of anthropology proper, in the nineteenth century, cultural diversity became prominent in the hands of the polygenists."
6225,这样的“现实主义”简直就是可悲的。,"""Realism"" of this sort is simply pathetic."
6225,事实上这根本不是现实主义，而是人类中心主义，除了依据作为原始动力的人以外，就无力解释一系列事件。,"As a matter of fact, it is not realism at all but anthropocentrism, an inability to interpret a chain of events except in terms of man as the prime mover."
6225,当然，只有人才能修饰自己的仪表，当然，文化也并不是随心所欲和飘泊不定的游魂，当然，只有人才紧钟表的发条、制造汽车和建筑摩天大楼，等等。,"Of course it is people who enamel their fingernails; of course culture is not a disembodied soul going its way of its own sweet will; to he sure, it is people who wind clocks, manufacture automobiles, build skyscrapers."
6226,在同时期的美国，田野民族志和认知人类学的研究是通过人类普遍行为模式、语言模式和文化特有的语义结构的研究而发展起来的。它完全可以与其他国家的“ 结构主义” 相媲美。,"Meanwhile in the United States, studies in ethnoscience and cognitive anthropology developed through interests in human universals, linguistic models, and culture-specific semantic structures which parallel ‘structuralism’ proper in other countries."
6226,列维－斯特劳斯自己曾经常赞美我们大家都普遍认为是游离在结构主义传统之外的美国学者，因为这些美国学者为他的理论做出了贡献。,"Le ́vi- Strauss himself has frequently praised Americans outside the structuralist tradition as we usually think of it, for their contributions towards his own theories."
6227,在她们重新融入社会之前，桑德联盟中有经验的妇女会教她们作为未来子女的抚养者如何履行道德责任和实际职责，一旦培训结束，这些行过成年礼的女孩也会成为桑德联盟的一分子。,"Until their incorporation back into society, they are trained in the moral and practical responsibilities of potential childbearers by experienced women in the Sande association, an organization the initiates will belong to once their training has ended."
6227,不过，这一培训也不完全严酷无情，因为有唱歌、跳舞和讲故事相伴。而且这些行成年礼的女孩吃得也很好。,"This training is not all harsh, however, for it is accompanied by a good deal of singing, dancing, and storytelling, and the initiates are very well fed."
6227,"这样,她们会对身为女人形成一种积极的看法，强烈地感受到姐妹情谊。","Thus, they acquire both a positive image of womanhood and a strong sense of sisterhood."
6227,一旦培训结束，她们就会用树叶泡水制成的药物进行一次仪式性的洗涤，去掉在幽闭期间庇护她们的巫术防护。,"Once their training is complete, a medicine made by brewing leaves in water is used for a ritual washing, removing the magical protection that has shielded them during the period of their confinement."
6228,同时，我们必须承认，一定程度的和谐在任何合适地发挥功能的文化中都是必要的，我们不应该假定完全的和谐是必须的。,"While we must recognize that a degree of harmony is necessary in any properly functioning culture, we should not assume complete harmony is required."
6228,因为没有两个个体以恰好同样的方式经历濡化的过程，没有两个个体以正好同样的方式感知他们的文化，因而在任何文化中总存在某种变化的潜力。所以我们倒是应该说说文化的黏合应力。,"Because no two individuals experience the enculturation process in precisely the same way, no two individuals perceive their culture in exactly the same way, so always some potential for change exists in any culture.We should speak, instead, of a strain to consistency in culture."
6228,只要各个部分是合理地黏合的，那么文化就会充分合理地运行。,"So long as the parts are reasonably consistent, a culture will operate reasonably well."
6228,然而，如果黏合应力失效，那么文化危机的情境就会接踵而至。,"If, however, that strain to consistency breaks down, a situation of cultural crisis ensues."
6229,比如，苏丹的定居的福尔人（Fur）和游牧的巴格拉人（Baggara）之间的关系，有一种经济上的互补。,"In the relationship between the sedentary Fur and the nomadic Baggara in the Sudan, for example, there is an economic complementarity."
6229,他们在商品交换上是相互依靠的，并且在生态领域上互补。,They are mutually dependent on commodity exchange and occupy complementary ecological niches.
6229,如同贡纳·哈兰德（Gunnar Haaland 1969）曾经说过的，通过交换生活方式，福尔人可以变成巴格拉人，如同利奇（Leach 1954）曾表明的，克钦人也可以变成掸人（Shan）；但是在这个过程中，区分不同群体的种族边界仍然保持不变。,"As Gunnar Haaland (1969) has shown, Fur may become Baggara by changing their way of life, just as Leach (1954) showed that Kachin could become Shan; but the ethnic boundary separating the groups remains untouched in the process."
6230,由于涂尔干对社会秩序的认识受到19世纪自然科学动态平衡和强调能量守恒的观点的支持，同时受到认可的还有人类社会生活中矛盾的普遍性，以及后爱因斯坦时代所强调的熵和秩序的基点，它与感觉和感知的一致性（Bateson 1951：246ff.）。,"Inasmuch as Durkheimian notions of social order were in sympathy with nineteenth-century natural-scientific notions of homeostasis and an emphasis on the conservation of energy, an appreciation of the ubiquity of contradictoriness in human social life coincides with a post-Einsteinian emphasis on the contingency of order, its pertaining to perception and perspective, and on entropy (cf. Bateson 1951:246ff.)."
6230,目前另一种更具反思性的人类学观点涉及人类建构的秩序的含义及随之而来的不确定性；这些建构出来的秩序是特定的多样的，且会变化。,"There is now a far more reflexive anthropological appreciation of the implicatedness of human beings in the order they construe and the uncertainty this gives onto; constructions are situated and diverse, and constructions change."
6230,即使人会为他们自己和他们的世界寻求意义和秩序，他们的生活依然是无法预测的，和其他人一样，甚至是一样的杂乱（Abrahams 1990；Prigogine 1989）。,"Even as human beings seek meaning and order in themselves and their world, their lives remain unpredictable—to themselves as to others—even chaotically so (cf. Abrahams 1990; Prigogine 1989)."
6231,这不仅仅是一个空间运动问题而且也是个时间问题：第一代移民和他那不说乌尔都语的孙辈对于“穆斯林印度人”身份的定义是截然不同的。,"This is not only a question of spatial movement but also of time: what defines the ""Muslim Indian"" identity is rather different for a firstgeneration immigrant and for his grandson who does not speak Urdu."
6231,我们在此面对的是过渡身份。,
6231,,We are confronted here with transitional identities.
6231,这并不一定意味着，我们在朝着完全融入“主导性”群体前进，而意味着我们不能将定义相对明确的“少数者群体”概念作为我们分析的基础。,"This does not necessarily imply that we are heading towards full integration into the ""dominant"" group, but that we cannot base our analysis on relatively well defined ""minority groups""."
6232,巴恩斯建议叫做社会关系网络的正是这种关系系统。,It is this kind of system of relations that Barnes proposed calling social networks.
6232,这里应该注意到，关系网通常没有边界和清楚的内部组织，因为任何人都认为他或她自己是这个关系网的中心。巴恩斯进一步认为，小型社区和大范围社会之间最重要的区别之一是，前者的社会关系网比后者的社会关系网更加稠密。,"Here it should be noted that networks often have no boundaries and no clear internal organisation, since any person may consider him- or herself the centre of the network.Barnes further holds that one of the most important differences between small communities and large-scale societies is the fact that the networks are more dense in the former than in the latter."
6232,当大都市里的两个人第一次会面时，他们很难发现双方有一些共同的熟人；小型社会中则相反，“每个人”都以不同的方式相互认识——通过家族关系、普通朋友、邻居、共同的学校经历、职业生涯和/或婚姻关系。,"When two people meet for the first time in a large-scale urban society, it is quite rare for them to discover that they have many common acquaintances; in small-scale societies, on the contrary, ""everybody"" knows each other in many different ways – through kinship, common friends and neighbours, shared school experiences, professional life and/or intermarriage."
6233,人类学对分类的研究始于涂尔干一莫斯的论文，其中认为分类的源泉是社会群体，分类的目的是社会化群体成员并使之凝聚，分类的结果是将共同的集体生活世界对象化。,"Anthropological work on classification began with the Durkheim—Mauss thesis which posited the sources of classification as being the social group, the purposes of classification as being the socialization and integration of group members, and the consequence of classification as being the objectification of a collective life-world which all share."
6233,这里设想在社会群体、它的语言世界和语言的含义之间存在一一对应的关系：语言成为单一的连续的分类框架（Berger and Luckmann 1969: 66）。,"Here was an imaging of a one-to-one relationship between a social group, its language-world, and that language's meanings: language as determinant of a single and consistent classificatory schema (cf. Berger and Luckmann 1969:66)."
6233,一直提倡的是更宽容的看待分类体系、语言、群体成员、世界观和行为之间的关系和各种潜在的可能性。,"What has been argued for since is a freer appreciation of the relations and the potential among system of classification, language, group membership, world-view and behaviour."
6234,从术语的字面意思看，他们的科学是他们的常识、他们的共同意思。,"Their science is, in the literal meaning of the term, their commonsense, their common meaning."
6234,从这个常识移到更广泛的公众“常识”，这再次涉及一个翻译行为。,"To move from this common sense to the ""common sense"" of the wider public involves again an act of translation."
6234,在社会人类学或者一般而言的社会学的情况，在这个层次上并不是非常不同的。,"The situation of social anthropology, or sociology in general, is not at this level so very different."
6234,区别在于这个事实，即社会学的现象被进行客观研究，只是在一定程度上才将它们的主现含义考虑进来，被研究的人们潜在地能够分享社会学家对他们的社会学意识。,The difference lies in the fact that sociological phenomena are objectively studied only to the extent that their subjective meaning is taken into account and that the people studied are potentially capable of sharing the sociological consciousness that the sociologist has of them.
6234,(Pocock 1961:88；着重号是我加的）,(1961:88—89; emphasis added)
6235,大多数生物学家关心共同点。,Most biologists focus on the similarities.
6235,在把人当做文化产物进行研究的时候，情况会更加复杂。,"In the study of humans as cultural beings, the situation is more complicated."
6235,当然，人类学家必然会考虑那些所有人都有的共同点，因为我们已达成共识，所有人都是文化生物以及都与社会习俗有所联系。,"Certainly, anthropology necessarily deals with something all humans havein common, since we have already established that all humans are cultural creatures and relate to social conventions."
6235,另一方面，许多人类学家也致力于解释个体差异和那些具有唯一性的独特社会。,"On the other hand, many anthropologists have also been concerned with accounting for individual variations and with the uniqueness of particular societies."
6236,社会学和社会心理学就是把握这类超个人决定因素的科学技术结构。,Sociology and social psychology were the organizations of scientific techniques to grapple with this class of meta-individual determinants.
6236,在这些科学的组织结构中，人们曾假设决定人类行为的诸范畴现在已被穷尽了。,In the organization of these sciences it was assumed that the categories of determinants of human behavior had now been exhausted.
6236,天文学和地球物理学将注重无机性决定因素，解剖学、生理学利心理学将围绕个人决定因素进行研究，而社会学即关于社会的科学将探讨超个人的决定因素。还有什么其它的决定因素需加以探讨吗？,"Astronomy and terrestrial physics would take care of the inanimate determinants; anatomy, physiology, and psychology would encompass the individual determinants; and sociology, the science of society, would deal with the supraindividual determinants: what other determinants were there to be reckoned with?"
6237,民主国家是社会有机体，它的生活是由整合和管理机构调节的，这种机构在其正式领域里表现为国家，而在其非制度化或至少是法律以外的领域中则是“政治机器。,"A democratic nation is a social organism.Its life is regulated by a mechanism of integration and control that is the State in its formal aspects and the ""political machine"" in its non-institutionalized or at least extra-legal aspect."
6237,”这一机构协调该政体的各个部分与过程，并且建立与其它国家的各种关系。,"This mechanism coordinates the various segments and processes of the body politic, and negotiates relations with other nations."
6237,这样，国家生活就是由一个相对较小的部分来调控的。,The life of the nation is thus regulated and controlled by a relatively small segment.
6237,选举也不过成为要选民们对那些并非由他们亲自提出，而且多半不知其姓名的候选人说声“是”或“不是”而已。,"The electorate is permitted to say ""yes"" or ""no"" with reference to a number of candidates whom they have had no hand in choosing, and of whom, for the most part, they have never heard."
6238,1989年社会主义的瓦解对戈德利埃在近年背离结构主义毫无影响，而且他完全清楚，马克思主义作为他所说的元理论已经死亡，虽然他仍然在某些与权力和屈服相关的特定马克思主义观点当中看到了潜能。,"The collapse of socialism in 1989 has done nothing to encourage Godelier to retreat from structuralism in recent years, and he fully recognizes that Marxism as what he calls a meta-theory is dead, though he continues to see potential in particular Marxist insights relating to power and subjection."
6238,相反，泰雷、梅阿索、雷伊等人看来始终更接近主流的马克思主义。,"By contrast, Terray, Meillassoux, Rey, and so on have always seemed closer to mainstream Marxism."
6238,不过，他们也同样感到，必须要对马克思主义的正统信条进行调整以适应为前资本主义社会找到某种充分的马克思主义式的解释这一要求。,"They too, however, feel compelled to adjust Marxist orthodoxy to the demands of finding some sort of adequate Marxist interpretation for precapitalist societies."
6239,印度尼西亚是湿的，而摩洛哥是干的。,"Indonesia is wet, and Morocco is dry."
6239,以这一对比作为出发点，格尔茨探讨了一个摩洛哥地区和一个印度尼西亚（巴厘岛的）地区的社会组织的不同之处。,"With this contrast as a starting-point, Geertz discusses differences of social organisation in a Moroccan and an Indonesian (Balinese) locality."
6239,首先，明显的一点是，两个社会中的农民必须种植不同的农作物。,"First, it is obvious that farmers in the two societies must grow different crops."
6239,格尔茨所研究的摩洛哥地区种植小麦和橄榄；巴厘岛用灌溉水田种水稻。,The Moroccans studied by Geertz cultivate wheat and olives; the Balinese grow rice in irrigated paddies.
6239,在摩洛哥，水是一种稀缺而昂贵的资源，但在巴厘岛，水却是免费而丰富的。,"Water is a scarce and costly resource in Morocco, while it is free and abundant in Bali."
6240,第一个层次，”功能”表示一种制度对另一种制度的影响，就是说，是社会制度之间的关系。,"At the first, ‘function’ denotes the effects of an institution on other institutions, that is, the relation between social institutions."
6240,这个层次类似于拉德克利夫－布朗著作中所说的制度。,This level is similar to that in Radcliffe-Brown’s work.
6240,第二个层次牵扯到以社区成员阐释的观点理解制度。,The second involves the understanding of an institution in terms defined by members of the community.
6241,社会科学术语中的一些常见词语，如社会习俗（social convention）、互动（interaction）、社团（corporations）和部门（categories），都是高度抽象的比较概念。,"Common words in social science jargon, such as social convention, interaction, corporations and categories are highly abstract comparative concepts."
6241,在跨文化比较中，它们都是很有用的，但它们在本国（或本民族）词汇中只占很稀少的一部分。,"They are useful in cross-cultural comparison, but they only very rarely form part of the native (or emic) vocabulary."
6241,对于另一些被用来描述人类不同类型的社会关系的那些概念来说，这一点也是正确的。,"This also holds true for an additional, useful group of concepts which have been developed to describe the various kinds of social relationships engaged in by humans."
6241,首先，社会的所有成员都对其他成员具有一定的权利和义务，而很少有两个人会具有完全同样的权利和义务。,"First, all members of society have certain rights and duties in relation to other members, and there are hardly two individuals who have exactly the same rights and duties."
6242,在某种程度上，族群性和阶级是可以比较的，因为两种现象都与权力差异和在公共空间的竞争有关。,"Ethnicity and class are to some extent comparable, since both phenomena are related to power discrepancies and competition in public space."
6242,相反，跨越族群性和阶级的分割线的性别在一种简单的意义上与两者都不相关，但它在众多社会情境中都很重要。,"Gender, on the contrary, cuts across both ethnicity and class and is not related to either of them in a simple way, yet it is important in a multitude of social situations."
6242,因此，并不是地位决定了在阶级、性别和族群性之间，哪个身份是最“根本的”。,"This is not the place, therefore, to decide which status is the most ""fundamental"" out of class, gender and ethnicity."
6243,而且，对于多数印度人来说，一种囊括所有印度教徒的共同的集体身份的想法也远非那么明显：种姓和重要的语言学区别在划分印度教徒的同时也团结了他们。和平等主义的欧洲社会不同，印度社会因为等级制度和差异而繁荣，印度教原教旨主义强调的却是相似性。从意识形态上看，印度教原教旨主义类似于欧洲的民族主义和其他地方的身份政治。它的一些特点，也可以在其他环境中鉴别出来一从斐济到南斯拉夫一如下，括号中的例子大部分是说明。,"Also, the idea of a shared collective identity encompassing all Hindus is far from obvious to most Indians; both caste and important linguistic distinctions have divided Hindus as much as uniting them."
6243,外部边界被过度传达，内部差异被传达不足。,
6243,（在印度教原教旨主义的例子中，有含义的他人是穆斯林——不论在印度还是在巴基斯坦。,
6243,）问题：翻译不准确贴切改1：而且，对于多数印度人来说，一种囊括所有印度教徒的共同的集体身份的想法也远非那么明显：种姓和重要的语言学区别在划分印度教徒的同时也团结了他们。,
6243,和平等主义的欧洲社会不同，印度社会因为等级制度和差异而繁荣，印度教原教旨主义强调的却是相似性。,"Unlike egalitarian European societies, Indian society has thrived on hierarchy and difference.Hindutva nevertheless emphasises similarity."
6243,从意识形态上看，印度教原教旨主义类似于欧洲的民族主义和其他地方的身份政治。,"Ideologically, hindutva is reminiscent of both European nationalisms and identity politics elsewhere."
6243,它的一些特点，也可以在其他环境中鉴别出来一从斐济到南斯拉夫一如下，括号中的例子大部分是说明。,"Some of its features, which can be identified in many other settings as well – from Fiji to Yugoslavia – are as follows."
6243,外部边界被过度传达，内部差异传达不足。,The external boundary is overcommunicated; internal differences are undercommunicated.
6243,（在印度教原教旨主义的例子中，举足轻重的他人是穆斯林——不论在印度还是在巴基斯坦。）,"(In the case of hindutva, the significant others are Muslims – both Indian and Pakistani.)"
6244,形态学关心语言中声音组合的最小意义单位——词素。句法涉及一些原则，短语和句子根据这些原则构成。,Syntax refers to the principles phrases and sentences are built with.
6244,语言的完整形式结构构成语言的语法，它由关于语言的词素和句法的所有观察资料组成。,"The entire formal structure of a language, consisting of all observations about its morphemes and syntax, constitutes its grammar."
6244,人类语言根植于我们从灵长目动物祖先继承来的姿势一呼叫系统。姿势一呼叫系统起到“为”言语“定基调”的作用，为解释语言形式提供合适的框架。,"Human language is embedded in a gesture-call system inherited from our primate ancestors that serves to ""key"" speech，providing the appropriate frame for interpreting linguistic form."
6244,这一系统的姿势成分由用来传递信息的身体运动组成；把这些身体运动做成标记并记录下来的系统叫作声势学。,The gestural component of this system consists of body motions used to convey messages; the system of notating and recording these motions is known as kinesics.
6244,辅助语言代表呼叫成分，它是由包括各种各样音质和发嗓音的语言外声音构成的。,"The call component is represented by paralanguage, consisting of extralinguistic noises involving various voice qualities and vocalizations."
6245,但“文化”也是其他学科的研究领域，包括：社会学、民俗研究、文学批评。,"But then ""culture"" is the province of other academic disciplines besides: sociology, folklore, literary criticism."
6245,人类学研究的不同点，在格尔茨看来，在于其操作化的方式；人类学家所做的，首先也最重要的，是民族志。,"What distinguishes anthropological study, for Geertz, is the way that it is operationalized; what anthropologists do, first and foremost, is ethnography."
6245,民族志可以被看作是一种“记录”文化的特殊方式，一种特别的“浓重”的写作。,"And ethnography can be understood as a particular way of ""inscribing"" culture, as a special kind of ‘thick’ writing."
6245,人类学的分析，一言以蔽之，就是在深描中冒险。,"What anthropological analysis amounts to, in a word, is a venture in thick description."
6246,生态学部分从物质环境和统治结构开始（第一章），再转向作为乡村生活基础的家庭（第二、三章），并以较长的篇幅描述转场放牧作结（第四、五、六、七章）。,"The ecology begins with the physical environment and structures of domination (chapter 1), moves on to the household as the foundation of village life (chapters 2 and 3), and concludes with an extended portrait of transhumant pastoralism (chapters 4, 5, 6, and 7)."
6246,勒华拉杜里让由克莱格家族所代表的以家庭为形式的乡村生活对抗浓缩在皮埃尔˙莫里这个人身上的山上放牧生活。,"Le Roy Ladurie opposes village life in households, exemplified by the Clergues, to shepherd life in the hills, epitomized in the person of Pierre Maury."
6246,（后者以下面要讨论的一种异常的方式，受到了比前者既更广泛也更理想化的处理。,"(The latter, in an anomalous manner discussed below, receives both more extensive and more idealized treatment than the former.)"
6246,）组织得比较松散的考古学部分则是以体态语开始，以神话结束。,The more loosely organized archeology begins with body language and ends with myth.
6246,在这两者之间，勒华拉杜里常常以令人心痒的调子讨论性、性欲、生命周期（婚姻、孩童时期、死亡）、时间和空间、巫术、宗教、道德，以及另外的世界。,"In between Le Roy Ladurie discusses, often in titillating tones, sex, libido, the life cycle (marriage, childhood, death), time and space, magic, religion, morality, and the other world."
6246,叙述者从头到尾都在用斜体的引文点缀他的正文—这些引文说起来似乎是那些农民自由的、直接的说话，仿佛某人一边就在村子里旁听，一边用言辞把它们呈现在这里。,"Throughout, the narrator punctuates his text with italicized citations, the purportedly free direct speech of the peasants, verbally presented as if one were eavesdropping in the village itself."
6247,可是，卡特林的视觉井不牢靠。,"Catlin's vision is not, however, secure."
6247,与今天的社会科学家不同，后者的理论(且不论其价值）为他们的民族志提供了可信性，而卡特林的可信性最终取决于他的描述的力量。,"Unlike today's social scientists whose theories (regardless of their merit) serve their ethnographic credibility, Catlin's credibility has ultimately to rest on the power of his descriptions."
6247,正如他的画作并非特别可信一样，其散文也是如此。,"Just as his painting is not particularly believable, nor is his prose."
6247,它自己否定了自己。,It undermines itself.
6247,他的目的是现实主义的，而他的文风却是浪漫主义的。,"His intention is realistic, but his style is romantic."
6247,通过隐喻，常常是毫无节制的隐喻、惊叹（ecphonesis)、混乱地使用称呼、夸张法、动人之辞（pathopoeia)、欲言又避而不谈（apoplanesis)、打断、延迟、主观主义——这只道出了他文体策略中的一小部分——卡特林努力给他的描述赋予一种强制的真实性，但正是这些策略颠覆了他的意图。,"Through metaphor, often extravagant metaphor, ecphonesis, the promiscuous use of the vocative, hyperbole, pathopoeia, apoplanesis, interruption, suspense, subjectivism—to name only a few of his stylistic strategies—Catlin tries to give to his descriptions a compelling veracity, but it is precisely these strategies that subvert his intention."
6247,现实主义要求文体上的节制。,Realism demands stylistic sobriety.
6247,而对于卡特林来说，这种节制却会妨碍他的可信性所依赖的生动叙述。,For Catlin such sobriety precludes the hypotyposis upon which his credibility rests.
6248,他们的观点源于一种缺失感：现代社会缺乏传统意义上的家，这种家具有固定性和物理上的中心，具有绝对的价值观点和统一的实体。,"Their ideas derive from a sense of loss: that in the modern world there has been lost a traditional home of fixity and physical centredness, of absolute values and a unified reality."
6248,如今这种“原初”社会文化环境被连根拔起，后来的也不能成为真正意义上的家。,"Now uprooted from this first and ‘original’ socio-cultural milieu, no succeeding one becomes truly home."
6248,个体穿行于多重的生活世界，却未能找到一个家。,Individuals are in transit between a plurality of life-worlds but come to be at home in none.
6249,正是人类社会有可能为了他们的生存而破坏生态环境这一事实应该证明，我们远非被我们的生态系统所决定，也远非完美地适应了生态系统。,"The very fact that it is possible for human societies to undermine the ecological conditions for their own survival ought to prove that we are far from determined by, and perfectly adapted to, our ecosystem."
6249,但是，这一事实也可提醒我们，提醒我们在社会和环境之间存在着一种持续而必要的相互交换。,"However, this fact also serves as a reminder that there is a continuous, and necessary, mutual exchange between society and environment."
6249,有些社会已经被证明相当稳定，因为他们复制了一种不会采用不可挽回的方式改变环境的技术——那些方式要求技术革新或是剧烈的社会变迁。,Some societies have proven remarkably stable in that they have reproduced a technology which did not alter their environment irreversibly in ways requiring technical innovation or dramatic social change.
6249,穆布提的俾格米人在前面的章节里已经讨论过，另一个例子是新几内亚高地的园艺种植社会。,The Mbuti pygmies have been discussed in an earlier chapter; another example might be the horticultural societies of highland New Guinea.
6249,最近的考古学发现似乎显示，在几千年以前就已在那里出现了几乎与今天的主导技术相同的技术。,Recent archaeological findings seem to indicate that roughly the same kind of technology which is dominant today was present there thousands of years ago.
6250,戴尔·海姆斯（Dell Hymes 1981）关于美洲土著人神话叙事中诗歌的研究为理解日常诗歌做出了相当大的突破性贡献。,The writings of Dell Hymes (1981) on the poetics of the mythic narration of Native Americans are a ground-breaking endeavour for the enterprise of understanding everyday poetics.
6250,他揭示了北美土著人叙事中十分精致的诗歌，一种人类学过去从未认识也未想到的诗歌形式（“原始人”不可能有诗歌！）。,"He unfolds the well-elaborated poetics of Native North American narrations, a poetical form neither recognized nor expected by anthropology in the past (""primitives"" cannot have poetics!)."
6250,他坦率地把自己的方法称为“结构主义”，不过实际上仅仅从法国结构主义那里借用了一些形式主义的东西。,"His methodology is one that he frankly labels as ""structuralist"", but it is a formalism that only hints at a precedent of French hue."
6251,列维-斯特劳斯认为（1961: 386）我们自己的民族中心主义是与某种实际存在的或仪式上的食人习俗的道德基础相关的。,Lévi-Strauss comments (1961:386) on our own ethnocentrism in being appalled on moral grounds by either actual or ritual cannibalism.
6251,谴责食人行为，意味着某种身体复活的观念，与身体在物质上被解体相对应。,"To condemn cannibalist practices implies for instance a belief in bodily resurrection, which would be compromised with the material destruction of the corpse."
6251,这作为一种宗教性的信仰和那些仪式性的食人行为所依据的信仰如出一辙。,This would be a religious belief of the same order as those in which ritualized cannibalism is practised.
6252,艾伦斯参阅了大量人类学研究，却没有发现一例可靠的目击食人族的说明。,"Arens, referring to a mass of anthropological research, could not find a single reliable eye-witness account of cannibalism."
6252,他指出，许多民族编造故事说他们的相邻部落是食人族，这也许可以说明认为食人族真实存在的看法如此普遍。,"He points out that many peoples tell stories to the effect that the neighbouring tribe are cannibals, which may explain why the belief in cannibalism is so widespread."
6252,他宣布，事实上，食人禁忌可能和乱伦禁忌一样普遍。如果艾伦斯至少是部分正确的，食人族就应该与分类法相关，但不是食物分类法。,"Actually, he intimates that a rule against cannibalism may be as universal as the incest taboo.If Arens is at least partly right, cannibalism has to do with classification, but not classification of food."
6253,虽然食肉动物经常分享食物，但在非人类的灵长成年动物中分享食物的例子很少，这些例子多半包括雄性黑猩猩合作狩猎，然后通常与成年雌性和幼年黑猩猩分享猎获物。,"Although carnivorous animals often share food, the few examples of food sharing among nonhuman primate adults all involve groups of male chimpanzees cooperating in a hunt and later sharing the spoils, frequently with adult females as well as juveniles."
6253,这表明食物分享和分工的起源，与偶尔吃陶转变到经常吃肉的食物习性的转变有关，这似乎是在大约250万年前随最早的人类成员产生而发生的。,This suggests that the origins of food sharing and the division of labor are related to a shift in food habits from infrequent to more frequent meat eating.This change seems to have occurred with the appearance of the earliest members of the genus Homo some 2.5 million years ago.
6253,寻食经济的最后的显著特点是，营地作为日常活动中心和食物分享实际发生地的重要性。,A final distinctive feature of the food-foraging economy is the importance of the camp as the center of daily activity and the place where food sharing actually occurs.
6254,虽然食肉动物经常分享食物，但在非人类的灵长成年动物中分享食物的例子很少，这些例子多半包括雄性黑猩猩合作狩猎，然后通常与成年雌性和幼年黑猩猩分享猎获物。,"Although carnivorous animals often share food, the few examples of food sharing among nonhuman primate adults all involve groups of male chimpanzees cooperating in a hunt and later sharing the spoils, frequently with adult females as well as juveniles."

6254,寻食经济的最后的显著特点是，营地作为日常活动中心和食物分享实际发生地的重要性。,A final distinctive feature of the food-foraging economy is the importance of the camp as the center of daily activity and the place where food sharing actually occurs.
6255,让我们想象一下恩加人氏族成员所面对的难题。,Let us imagine the problems faced by the members of an Enga clan.
6255,他们一直试图依靠小量集约经营的耕地维持适当的生计。,They are trying to make an adequate subsistence from small amounts intensely utilized land.
6255,他们周围是敌人的世界，敌人准备把他们从土地上赶出去，而且一见到弱点就乘机抓住它。,Surrounding them is a world of enemies ready to drive them from their land and seize it at the first sign of weakness.
6255,"他们必须采取各种措施以努力挫败这种外部威胁：（1）通过维持巨大的统一群体，他们在人数上显示力量,令别人害怕而不敢攻击他们。（2）通过合作积累食物和财富，在庆典上慷慨赠送，作为宴会的伙伴，他们引人注目；（3）因为强大和富裕，他们以防御为目的的同盟变得引人注目，使他们的邻居要么是朋友，要么是在人数上更多的敌人。","They must attempt to neutralize this external threat by several means: (1) by maintaining a large, unified group, they show strength in numbers, making others afraid to attack them; (2) by collaborating in the accumulation of food and wealth to be generously given away at ceremonies, they make themselves attractive as feasting partners; and (3) by being strong and wealthy, they become attractive as allies for defensive purposes, turning their neighbors either into friends or into outnumbered enemies."
6256,大多数单一民族国家都有一种官方的民族语言，有些国家甚至禁止在公共场合使用其他语言。在其他社会中，政治当局也对暴力和税收具有垄断权力。,"Most nation-states have an official national language; some have even banned the use of other languages in public.In other societies too, the political authorities have monopolies on violence and taxation."
6256,对于单一民族国家来说这方面的特别之处在于它所代表的权力的无比集中。,What is peculiar to the nation-state in this regard is the enormous concentration of power it represents.
6256,如果我们将现代战争与雅诺马马人的世仇相比，我们会清晰地看到差别所在。,"If we compare a modern war with a feud among the Yanomamö, we see the difference clearly."
6256,当以同样的方式包含了庞大数目的人（通常是几百万）的民族主义的抽象社区与以亲属制度为整合基础的社会（在雅诺马马人中，上限是几百人）相比，现代国家在许多情况下都能被看成是社会组织的其他形式的无比放大。,"In the same way as the abstract community of nationalism encompasses an incredible number of people (usually many millions) compared to societies integrated on the basis of kinship (among the Yanomamö, there is an upper limit of a few hundred people), the modern state may in many cases be seen as an enormous enlargement of other forms of social organisation."
6257,简单说，人类学不能，就算它希望，达致一个对亲属关系的普遍定义。,"In short, anthropology cannot, even if it wished, arrive at a universal definition of kinship."
6257,这窘境当然部分是由语言造成的，几乎全部的人类学的重要分析术语都没有高度抽象化，而是继续背负着西方思想与实践的复杂的历史抱负。,Part of the dilemma is of course linguistic insofar as most of the important analytic terms of anthropology have not only been highly abstract but also continued to carry the complex historical baggage of Western thought and practice.
6257,比如，社会、社区、家庭、亲属关系、继嗣、世系、或者结构、功能、系统在使用中都存在风险，很可能回避了其他民族对自己的社会行为的理解——而这正是人类学存在的任务和理由。,"Terms such as society, community, family, kinship, descent, lineage, or structure, function, system are to be used at the peril of totally eluding another people’s understanding of what they are doing socially—which is the very raison d’être of the anthropological task."
6258,阿兹特克人由半神的国王统治。国王由贵族、祭司和世系群首领组成的政务委员会从王家世系的候选人中选出。,"The Aztecs were governed by a semidivine king, whom a council of nobles, priests, and leaders chose from among candidates of royal lineage."
6258,虽然国王是专制君主，但是政务委员会委员在国家事务方面向他提供建议。,"Although the king was an absolute monarch, the councilors advised him on affairs of state."
6258,大置的政府宫员监督各项职责，如维护税收制度和法院、掌管政府库藏，以及指挥军事训练等等。,"A vast number of government officials oversaw various functions, such as maintenance of the tax system and the courts of justice, management of government storehouses, and control of military training."
6258,典型的阿兹特克城市呈矩形，反映了土地在各世系群中分配的方式。,The typical Aztec city was rectangular and reflected the way the land was divided among the lineages.
6258,在城中央有一个大广场，建有神庙和城市统治者的居所。,In the center was a large plaza containing the temple and the house of the city's ruler.
6259,对经济学家来说，市场交换（Market exchange）牵涉到按供需力量确定价格的物品和服务的买卖。,"To an economist, market exchange has to do with the buying and selling of goods and services, with prices set by the powers of supply and demand."
6259,虽然忠诚和价值不应起作用，但是它们却经常起作用。,"Loyalties and values are not supposed to play a role, but they often do."
6259,在什么地方从事买卖基本上是无关紧要的，因此，我们必须把市场交换与市场地点区别开来。,"Just where the buying and selling takes place is largely irrelevant, so we must distinguish between market exchange and the marketplace."
6259,虽然我们的某些市场交易的确在某个具体指定的地点进行——例如，许多棉花交易是在新奥尔良棉花交易所进行的——对北美人来说，交易的双方完全可能不在大陆的同一边进行物品买卖。,"Although some modern market transactions do occur in a specific identifiable location—much of the trade in cotton, for example, happens in the New Orleans Cotton Exchange—it is also quite possible for North Americans to buy or sell goods without ever being on the same side of the continent as the other party."
6260,这种狩猎的最复杂的例子是在倭黑猩猩狩猎时发生的；一旦潜在的猎物偏离其团队，三个或更多的成年倭黑猩猩就小心翼翼地占据自己的位置，封锁猎物的逃跑之路，同时另一个爬向被捕食的动物加以捕杀。在捕杀猎物后，大部分在场的倭黑猩猩都得到一份肉食，或者在机会来临时抓取一片肉，或者坐着乞求得到一片肉。,"The most sophisticated examples of this occur when hunting baboons; once a potential victim has been partially isolated from its troop, three or more adults will carefully position themselves to block off escape routes while another climbs toward the prey for the kill."
6260,不管肉类的营养价值怎样，狩猎不只是为了日常饮食的目的，而且也是出于政治的和社会群体内性关系的原因。,
6260,肉食的赠送有助于巩固雄性之间的联盟，而肉食的分享也诱发肿胀的、易接受的雌性接受性交行为。,"Once a kill has been made, the meat is shared in a strategic way to support male allies and females."
6260,其实，如果雌性在场的话，雄性会更敏捷地狩猎，而且受孕期的雌性乞讨肉食会更为成功。,"Modern-day chimps may be recent meat eaters; living at the edge of the savanna, they may be just starting to use a food source human ancestors tapped in similar circumstances millions of years earlier."
6261,民族志通过与相近和早先的话语形成鲜明对照来进行自我定义，这种策略使它很难把自己当作一种写作方式来解释与审视。,This strategy of defining itself by contrast to adjacent and antecedent discourses limits ethnography's ability to explain or examine itself as a kind of writing.
6261,民族志通过与其他写作体裁的对立来确立自身的合法地位，做法如此过火以致遮蔽了这一事实：它本身的话语方式通常源于这些别类体栽，而且如今也仍然与之共享。,"To the extent that it legitimates itself by opposition to other kinds of writing, ethnography blinds itself to the fact that its own discursive practices were often inherited from these other genres and are still shared with them today."
6261,虽然偶尔还有人将民族志视为一种中立的、无修辞话语的典范，认为它对异文化观实的描述是“精确地按其本原”而未经我们自身价值观和诠释模式的过滤。,"At times one still hears expressed as an ideal for ethnography a neutral, tropeless discourse that would render other realities ""exactly as they are,"" not filtered through our own values and interpretive schema."
6261,不过，这种错误的路径基本上巳不再被遵循，我们可以说民族志也如其他任何一种话语形式一样受修辞的雕琢。,"For the most part, however, that wild goose is no longer being chased, and it is possible to suggest that ethnographic writing is as trope-governed as any other discursive formation."
6262,他们的定义很明确:“广义地说，我们用体现这一术语指身体内部和贯穿身体的某些社会价值和控制的支柱……”（1998: 237)。,"Their definition is quite straightforward: ‘In the broadest sense, we take the term embodiment to refer to the anchoring of certain social values and dispositions in and through the body . . .’ (1998: 237)."
6262,其他人利用这一概念探寻权力和性别，甚至物种。,"Others have utilized the concept to explore aspects not only of power and gender, but even species."
6262,因此，对于唐娜•哈拉维（Dorma Haraway)来说（Harawayl988; 1991)，性别和女权主义都与体现有关，但体现还同时具有个体性和集体性，后者就某种意义来说，身体用来定义集体性，比如所有女性的（或原始的)身体。,"Thus for Donna Haraway (1988; 1991), both gender and feminism are about embodiment, while embodiment is further both individual and collective, the latter in the sense that it defined the collectivity, for example, of all female human (or primate) bodies."
6263,1962年，当我在苏腊巴亚做田野调査时，数百万当地居民中，约有7.5万人是叫化子。,"In 1962, when I was doing fieldwork in Surabaya, an estimated 75,000 of its million inhabitants were beggars."
6263,多数人都营养不良，仅靠西方人所吃食物的1/3来维持生活。,"Most people were undernourished, living on a third the food Westerners eat."
6263,通货膨胀来势凶猛，难以控制；价格每月都会上涨三倍，每月工资仅够应付几天的生活。,"Inflation had run away; prices were tripling monthly, and monthly wages were enough for only a few days of each month."
6263,我妻子和我所寄居的那户人家，住在一个靠近铁道的简陋棚屋中，仅仅是勉强维持生活。,"The family with whom my wife and I were living, in a shantytown near the railroad tracks, were surviving but barely."
6263,在那里，很难获得药物，通信时断时续；运输，等于就是一场冒险。,"Medicine was difficult to obtain; communications were uncertain; transportation, an adventure."
6264,马林诺夫斯基的学生乔莫•肯尼亚塔后来成为肯尼亚第一任总统，在他关于肯尼亚人民的田野民族志著作中加入了反思性的评论（Kenyatta 1938)，但大多数马林诺夫斯基和博厄斯的追随者对此避而不谈。,"Malinowski’s student Jomo Kenyatta, later the firrst president of Kenya, included reflexive comment in his ethnography of his own people (Kenyatta 1938), but most of the Malinowskians and the Boasians steered clear."
6264,列维-斯特劳斯在《忧郁的热带》中加入大量自传（Lévi-Strauss 1976 [1955])，虽然他也把田野民族志和理论评述与之分开。,"Lévi-Strauss included much autobiography in Tristes Tropiques (1976 [1955]), though he too separated this from both his ethnographic and his theoretical commentaries."
6264,大多数后现代主义者最根本的不同是他们主张反思本身是田野民族志，或至少是它的中心部分，而且田野民族志至少是人类学理论本身的重要部分（参见Rabinow 1977)。,"What makes the efforts of most post-modern writers fundamentally different is their assertion that reflexivity itself is ethnography, or at least a central part of it, and that ethnography is at least the major part of anthropological theory itself (see Rabinow 1977)."
6265,争端基本上以两种方式加以解决。,"Basically, disputes are settled in either of two ways."
6265,其一，争端双方可以通过争论和妥协而自愿达成彼此都满意的一份协议。,"First, disputing parties may, via argument and compromise, voluntarily arrive at a mutually satisfactory agreement."
6265,这种解决形式被称为谈判，或者，如果这个过程得到无偏见的第三方的帮助，则被叫作调解（mediation）。,"This form of settlement is referred to as negotiation or, if it involves an unbiased third party's assistance, mediation."
6265,在队群和部落中，第三方的调解人没有强制权力，因此不能强迫争端双方服从这种决定，但作为得到极大个人尊重的人来说，调解人经常可以借助这些判断来影响和解。,"In bands and tribes a third-party mediator has no coercive power and thus cannot force disputants to abide by such a decision, but as a person who commands great personal respect, the mediator frequently may effect a settlement through these judgments."
6266,调适的单位包括有机体和环境。,The unit of adaptation includes both organisms and the environment.
6266,有机体，包括人类，作为人类种群成员而存在；反过来，种群必须具有应付环境变异和变化的灵活性。,"Organisms exist as members of populations; populations, in turn, must have the flexibility to cope with variability and change within the environment."
6266,用生物学的术语说，这意味着种群中不同的有机体有某种程度的不同遗传资质。,"In biological terms, this means different organisms within the population have somewhat differing genetic endowments."
6266,从文化方面说，这意味着在个人的技艺、知识和人格之间产生差异。有机体和环境形成相互作用的系统。,"In cultural terms, it means variation occurs among individual skills, knowledge, and personalities.Organisms and environments form interacting systems."
6266,人们从事农耕和捕鱼或许是同样容易的，但我们不期望在北极圈北部找到农夫或者在撒哈拉沙漠发现为生计而捕鱼的人。,"People might as easily be farmers as fisher-folk, but we do not expect to find farmers north of the Arctic Circle or people who fish for a living in the Sahara Desert."
6267,"在日本,猕猴学会吃甘薯前先把它们洗干净，它们知道这样做的好处，并把它传给下一代。","In Japan, macaques that learned the advantages of washing sweet potatoes before eating them passed the practice on to the next generation."
6267,而且通常它就是那样做的；令人感兴趣的是，在任何特定的灵长目动物物种内，一个种群的文化通常不同于其他种群的文化，就如在人类中那样。,"And so it goes; it is interesting that within any given primate species, the culture of one population often differs from that of others, just as it does among humans."
6267,除此之外，我们也已发现，在囚笼里和在野外，一般地说，灵长目动物，特殊而言，猿猴，都“一般具有接近人的智力，包括以再现的方式利用声音、对他人目的和目标的充分的意识、参与策略性欺骗的能力，以及与人交流和相互交流的能力。”,"Beyond this, we have discovered both in captivity and in the wild that primates in general and apes in particular ""possess a near-human intelligence generally, including the use of sounds in representational ways, a rich awareness of the aims and objectives of others, the ability to engage in tactical deception, and the ability to use symbols in communication with humans and each other."""
6268,“无家可归”者的人类学就是我们，在自己的立场上，传达这样一种信息：我们也是地方的，我们自己的解决方法常常也是奇异的。,"An anthropology for ‘the unhomely’ would be where we, on our side, transmit the message that we too are local, and often bizarre in our solutions."
6268,对于他们自己，土著通常不需要这样的规劝，而我们就更不需要了。,"Indigenous peoples usually do not need this particular lesson about themselves, and certainly not about us."
6268,他们通常很适应共享知识的观念，但出于各种理由，对同化的观念就不那么热心。,"They are usually very comfortable with the idea of shared knowledges, but for obvious reasons not so keen on the idea of assimilation."
6268,他们从一开始就没有我们那种对知识的霸权观念，而且对差异更加宽容，也往往比我们更为开放。,"They from the start, not having our hegemonic ideas about knowledge and being more tolerant about difference, are usually much more open than we."
6269,图腾系统和社会中的宗族以两种互补的方式从符号层次上更深入地被联系了起来，也就是隐喻（metaphor)和转喻（metonymy)。,"The system of totems and the clans in society are further connected symbolically in two complementary ways, through metaphor and metonymy."
6269,隐喻是代表了另一种事物的符号，就像德布人的牛奶树代表了女人的多产（第十四章）。,"A metaphor is a symbol which stands for something else, in the way the milk tree among the Ndembu stands for fertility among women (Chapter 14)."
6269,而转喻更多的是用部分象征地表达整体。,A metonym is rather a part which symbolically expresses a whole.
6270,现在，让我们来总结，母系的和父系的继承系统之间的主要不同点。,Let us now sum up the central differences between matrilineal and patrilineal systems of descent.
6270,这两种系统在政治上通常都由男人支配。,Both kinds of systems are usually dominated politically by men.
6270,遗产，特别是土地权利，常常跟随男人。,"Inheritance, particularly land rights, often follows men."
6270,在父系社会，这些权利由父亲传递给孩子（往往是父传子）；在母系社会，往往由母亲的兄弟传给女儿的儿子。,"In patrilineal societies, such rights are transmitted from father to child (frequently from father to son); in matrilineal societies, they are transmitted from mother's brother to daughter's son."
6270,群体成员的归属以同样的方式变化。,Ascription of group membership varies along the same lines.
6270,在母系社会，自己与其母亲、母亲的母亲、母亲的兄弟、母亲的兄弟的孩子们，等等，是同一家族群体的成员。,"In a matrilineal society, ego will be a member of the same kin group as his or her mother, mother's mother, mother's brother, mother's brother's children, etc."
6270,在父系社会，你和你的父亲、父亲的父亲、父亲的兄弟、父亲的兄弟的孩子们，等等，属于同一群体。,"; in a patrilineal society, one belongs to the same group as one's father, father's father, father's brother, father's brother's children, etc."
6270,在父系系统，男人的妻子确保群体的延续性；在母系系统，由男人的姐妹们确保这一点。,"In patrilineal systems, the wives of the men ensure the continuity of the group; in matrilineal systems, the men's sisters do it."
6271,特别是，杜鲁门喜欢讨论过去四百年的变迁，而潘恩的核心主旨是比较E.M.弗斯特和萨尔曼·鲁什蒂耶（Salman Rushdie)的可能成为人类学表述的作品。,"In particular, Drummond is happy to talk in terms of four centuries of change, while Paine's central motif is a comparison of could-be anthropological representations between E.M.Forster and Salman Rushdie."
6271,要从历史角度出发进行论证是比较困难的，而且倾向于成为某种宏大历史的简化论，传统教条下的常规的人类学就是这样的 (从“固定到迁移”就像从“机械团结到有机团结” 从“社区到联盟”、 从“具体思想到抽象思想”、从“等级制到个体主义”）。,"The historical argument would seem to be the harder one to make, and would also seem prone to the kinds of grand-historical reductionism which characterized conventional anthropology in its traditional dispensation (from ""fixity to movement"" as from ""mechanical solidarity to organic"", from ""community to association"", from ""concrete thought to abstract"", from ""hierarchy to individualism"")."
6271,当然，关于频繁的全球迁移的历史学和考古学还是概括了当前莽撞情形的独特性。,"Certainly, the history and archaeology of frequent and global movement make generalizations about the uniqueness of the present foolhardy."
6272,他提出，我们的祖先发现不同家族间通婚的优点是创造友谊的纽带。,"Our ancestors, he suggested, discovered the advantage of intermarriage to create bonds of friendship."
6272,法国人类学家克劳德˙列维-斯特劳斯对这一理念作了详细的阐述。,Claude Levi-Strauss elaborated on this premise.
6272,"他把外婚制看作是区别早期原人生活与智人生活的根据。早期原人生活在隔离的同族婚配群体之中,而智人则生活在有累积文化支持的社会中。",He saw exogamy as the basis of a distinction between early hominine life in isolated endogamous groups and the life of Homo sapiens in a supportive society with an accumulating culture.
6272,婚姻联系确立并加强了与其他群体的联盟，使共享文化成为可能。,"Alliances with other groups, established and strengthened by marriage ties, make possible a sharing of culture."
6272,根据列维-斯特劳斯的研究工作，人类学家耶胡迪˙科恩提出，外婚制是促进群体间贸易的重要手段，因此它确保获得用其他方式得不到的必需物品以及资源。,"Building on Levi Strauss work, anthropologist Yehudi Cohen suggests exogamy was an important means of promoting trade between groups, thereby ensuring access to needed goods and resources not otherwise available."
6273,族群归属只是20世纪晚期更一般的文化动力学模式的一个领域或一个样本。,"Ethnicity is merely one domain, or one exemplar, of a more general pattern of cultural dynamics in the late twentieth century."
6273,少数族群的自传写作相应于当代关于文本性、知识和文化的理论，是后者的镜子和例证。,"Ethnic autobiographical writing parallels, mirrors, and exemplifies contemporary theories of textuality, of knowledge, and of culture."
6273,两种写作形式都提示了文化批评的强有力样式。,Both forms of writing suggest powerful modes of cultural criticism.
6273,它们是后现代的，这在于它们采用了如下一系列技法：双重焦点或视点互换，多重现实的并置，文本间性和交互参照，通过家族相似进行比较。,"They are post - modernin their deployment of a series of techniques: bifocality or reciprocity of perspectives, juxtapositioning of multiple realities, intertextuality and inter-referentiality, and comparison through families of resemblance."
6273,在当今文化间的对话和冲突的可能性都在不断增加的时代，民族志写作可能会从既处理族群归属又处理文本性、知识和文化的作家那里获得教益。,"Insofar as the present age is one of increasing potentialities for dialogue, as well as conflict, among cultures, lessons for writing ethnography may be taken from writers both on ethnicity and on textuality, knowledge, and culture."
6274,福楼拜对圣像研究和文献学的引证远远不是丰富想象力的、无甚价值的产物，在他对圣者心中的幻觉听作的看似千变万化的渲染中，这些引证实际上是中规中矩的。,"Far from being the idle products of a fertile imagination, Flaubert's references to iconography and philology in his seemingly phantasmagoric renderings of the saint's hallucinations were exact."
6274,福柯向我们展示了，福楼拜是如何终其一生回归到这一体验和写作的展现，并用它来作为一种苦行的训练：训练自己来反抗由它制造出的、萦绕在作家世界中的魔鬼。,"Foucault shows us how Flaubert returned throughout his life to this staging of experience and writing, and used it as an ascetic exercise both to produce and to keep at bay the demons that haunt a writer's world."
6274,于是，意料之中地，作为作家的福楼拜在身后留下了《布瓦与佩舒舍》（Bouvard el Pécuchet）这部卷帙浩繁而又平庸的文集。,It was no accident that Flaubert ended his life as a writer with that monstrous collection of commonplaces Bouvard et Pécuchet.
6274,《布瓦与佩舒舍》是对其他文本的忠实的注解，它可以被读解为一种将文本性（textuality)彻底驯化为一项自足的排列与分类练习的过程，这是一种图书馆的幻想。,"A constant commentary on other texts, Bouvard el Pécuchet can be read as a thorough domestication of textuality into a self-contained exercise of arranging and cataloguing: the fantasia of the library."
6275,虽然文化变迀是下一章才要加以讨论的主题，但如果一点也不提及复兴运动，那么任何対宗教的人类学考察都是不完整的。,"Although the subject of culture change is taken up in a later chapter, no anthropological consideration of religion is complete without some mention of revitalization movements."
6275,1931年，在（太平洋）所罗门群岛上的布卡人，突然兴起了一场本地人的宗教运动，运动的先知预言道，不久会有一场洪水吞没所有的白人。,"In 1931, at Buka in the Solomon Islands, a native religious cult suddenly emerged, its prophets predicting a deluge would soon engulf all Whites."
6275,之后，会有一艘满载着西方工业品的船来到。,This would be followed by the arrival of a ship laden with European goods.
6275,信奉者得建造一个家庭储藏室来储存这些物品，并准备好驱逐殖民地的警察。,The believers were to construct a storehouse for the goods and to prepare themselves to repulse the colonial police.
6275,因为这艘船只有在当地人把他们自己的供给用完之后才会到来，所以他们就停止在田地里劳作了。,"Because the ship would arrive only after the natives had used up all their own supplies, they ceased working in the fields."
6275,尽管这次运动的领导人被捕了，但崇拜持续了好几年。,"Although the cult leaders were arrested, the movement continued for some years."
6276,他作为一个理论家的创意可能会被质疑——可能的理论家先驱包括哲学家保罗·里克尔（Paul Ricoeur），格尔茨认可他的影响力，同时还有普里査德和马林诺夫斯基——但格尔茨作为一个写作者所具有的创意却不容置疑，而且他可能是当代人类学家中最出色的作家。,"While his originality as a theorist can be questioned (possible precursors include the philosopher Paul Ricœur, whose influence Geertz acknowledges, as well as Evans-Pritchard and Malinowski himself), his originality as a writer is beyond doubt, and Geertz ranks as perhaps the finest writer of contemporary anthropology."
6276,世纪之交，和他一起成为文化相对论的首要倡议者的还有他的同时代人萨林斯。格尔茨还出版了一些涉及不同话题的重要著作（从莫斯的交换理论到社会学和库克船长的死，参见第十五章），他不断强调符号王国的独立性，从而认定文化变迁不能借助于物质环境或人的生物性来解释。,"His contemporary Sahlins is, along with Geertz, the foremost proponent of cultural relativism around the turn of the millennium, and he has published a number of important books on various subjects (from Mauss's theory of exchange to sociobiology and the death of Captain Cook, see Chapter 15), consistently stressing the autonomy of the symbolic realm, thus arguing that cultural variation cannot be explained by recourse to material conditions or inborn biological properties of humans."
6277,人类另一种可能的选择是朝着文化多元主义一“即在一个社会中存在不止一种文化”——的方向发展文化多元主义要实现，就必须抛弃固执、偏见和种族主义。,"Another alternative is for humanity to move in the direction of cultural pluralism, where more than one culture exists in a society.To work, cultural pluralism must reject bigotry, bias, and racism."
6277,一些人类学家坚持认为，多元主义的安排是达成世界平衡与和平的唯一可行措施。,Some anthropologists maintain that pluralistic arrangements are the only feasible means of achieving global equilibrium and peace.
6277,与文化多元主义相关的一个问题是种族中心主义。,A problem associated with cultural pluralism is ethno- centrism.
6277,它常常在“国家建设”的名义下使一个群体得以把控制强加于其他群体通常的结果是长期、暴力和血腥的政治动乱，包括种族屠杀。,"All too often，in the name of ""nation building"", it has led one group to impose its control on others.Common consequences are prolonged violent and bloody political upheavals, including genocide."
6278,虽然马林诺夫斯基成功地建立了一支伟大的学术队伍，但他建立广义理论的努力却令人失望。,"Although Malinowski succeeded in building up a great following, his major venture into grand theory failed."
6278,他的“七项基本需求及其文化反应”的理论从未普遍流行。,His theory of ‘seven basic needs and their cultural responses’ never caught on.
6278,拉德克利夫－布朗的理论探索遭遇要稍好些，特别是他强调社会结构和提倡比较研究得到广泛接受。,Radcliffe-Brown’s theoretical ventures fared better: especially his emphasis on social structure and his encouragement of comparison.
6279,所有这些都意味着，在完全现实的意义上说，文化具有超有机体的特性。,"All of this means that culture has, in a very real sense, an extra-somatic character."
6279,尽管只有通过人类有机体才使文化的产生成为可能，但它一经出现并开始发展以后，就具有了它自身的生命。,"Although made possible only by the organisms of human beings, once in existence and under way it has a life of its own."
6279,它的行为是由自身法则而不是由人类有机体的法则所决定的。,"Its behavior is determined by its own laws, not by the laws of human organisms."
6279,对文化过程只有从文化的科学即文化学出发加以解释，而不能从心理学上解释。,"The culture process is to be explained in terms of the science of culture, of culturology, not in terms of psychology."
6280,显然，并非北美社会所有成员都会感到这种厌恶，否则乱伦发生率就不会那么高了（尤其是在父女之间）。但问题在于，对错误行为的任何遏制手段不是百分之百有效的。,"Obviously, not all members of North American society feel this disgust, or such a high incidence of incest would not occur, especially between fathers and daughters, but, then, no deterrent to misbehavior is ever 100% effective."
6280,文化控制根植于我們的意识之中，依赖于对超自然惩罚的恐惧——例如，袓先之灵破坏狩猎——和鹿法复仇之类的遏制手段。,"Cultural controls are built in, or internalized, and rely on such deterrents as fear of supernatural punishment—ancestral ghosts sabotaging the hunting, for example—and magical retaliation."
6280,"就像虔诚的基督教徒因为害怕下地狱而避免犯罪一样，一个人知道，如果他或她做错了事, 即使整个社区都不知晓，也会受到某种惩罚。","Like the devout Christian who avoids sinning for fear of hell, the individual expects some sort of punishment, even though no one in the community may be aware of the wrongdoing."
6281,每个部落组成一些斗士团体，而威望则来自狩猎和战斗技能。,"Each nation was organized into a number of warrior societies, and prestige came from hunting and fighting skills."
6281,他们的村落一般安排成独特的圆形样式。,Their camps typically were arranged in a distinctive circular pattern.
6281,许多宗教仪式，如太阳舞，是在整个平原地区都实行的有时地理区域在气候和地貌是不同的，因此，新的发现往往不是从一个群体传播到另一个群体。,"Many religious rituals, such as the Sun Dance, were practiced throughout the plains region.Sometimes geographic regions are not uniform in climate and topography, so new discoveries do not always spread from one group to another."
6281,而且，在一个文化区内，地方环境有差异，这些有利于调适的差异。,"Moreover, within a culture area, variations between local environments exist, and these favor variations in adaptation."
6281,美国西部人盆地——包括内华达和犹他州的一个地区，以及加利福尼亚、俄勒冈、怀俄明和爱达荷州的邻近部分——是一个恰当的例子。,"The Great Basin of the western United States—an area embracing Nevada and Utah, with adjacent portions of California, Oregon, Wyoming, and Idaho—is a case in point."
6282,威斯勒将全美洲（包括加勒比海）划定为15个文化区域：平原区、高原区、加利福尼亚区、北太平洋沿岸区，等等。,"Wissler had defined fifteen culture areas for all the Americas (including the Caribbean): Plains, Plateau, California, North Pacific Coast, and so on."
6282,克虏伯首先改变了这些文化区域的名称和边界，但是没有改变这些文化区的数目。,"Kroeber first altered the names and boundaries of the culture areas, but not their number."
6282,后来，克虏伯在他最重要的文化区域著作 (Kroeber 1939)中，仅在北美洲地图上就标出了84个“区域”和“亚区域”，他将这些归组成为七个“大区域”。,"Later, in his most important culture-area work, Kroeber (1939) mapped eighty-four ‘areas’ and ‘sub-areas’ which hegrouped into seven ‘grand areas’ of North America only."
6283,施密特是一位对非洲宗教有特殊兴趣的天主教神父。他认为，“非洲俾格米文化”比格雷布内尔的“塔斯马尼亚文化”更为“原始”。,"Schmidt, a Catholic priest with a special interest in African religions, argued that ‘African Pygmy culture’ was more ‘primitive’ than Graebner’s ‘Tasmanian culture’."
6283,施密特区分出四个基本文化圈(Schmidt 1939 [1937] ) 。,He distinguished four basic culture circles (Schmidt 1939 [1937]).
6284,在传统上，人类学被划分为四个领域：体质人类学和三个文化人类学分支学科：考古学、语言人类学和民族学。体质人类学（Physical Anthropology）主要研究作为生物有机体的人，而文化人类学（Cultural Anthropology）研究作为文化创造者的人类。,"Anthropology is traditionally divided into four fields: physical anthropology and the three branches of cultural anthropology, which are archaeology, linguistic anthropology, and ethnology.Physical anthropology is concerned primarily with humans as biological organisms, while cultural anthropology deals with humans as cultural animals."
6284,当然，二者是相互联系的。我们若不知道人类是如何创生的，我们就不能理解人是如何思考和行动的。,"Both, of course, are closely related； we cannot understand what people do unless we know what people are."
6284,我们想要了解生物特性是如何影响文化，文化又是如何影响生物特性的。,"And we want to know how biology does and does not influence culture, as well as how culture affects biology."
6285,由于认识到提出不受文化束缚假设的潜在难题，人类学家极为依赖在自然科学其他领域中被证明是成功的技术。,"By recognizing the potential problems of framing hypotheses that are not culture bound, anthropologists have relied heavily on a technique that has proved successful in other fields of the natural sciences."
6285,就如考古学家在蒂卡尔所做的研究那样，他们埋头于尽可能最完整的数据之中。,"As did the archaeologists working at Tikal, they immerse themselves in the data to the fullest extent possible."
6285,"借助于这样的工作方式，他们就非常透彻地熟悉细枝末节,因此他们能逐步看到数据内固有的模式；不然，其中的许多模式可能会被人 忽视。","By doing so, they become so thoroughly familiar with the minute details that they can begin to see patterns inherent in the data, many of which might otherwise have been overlooked."
6285,这些模式是人类学家据以提出假设的东西，因而它们可以接受进一步检验。,"These patterns allow anthropologists to frame hypotheses, which then may be subjected to further testing."
6286,如果人类学家要防止被推向荒谬的文化相对主义“什么都行”的立场，他们仍须避开根据种族中心主义的标准来判断其他文化习俗的陷阱。,"While anthropologists avoid the ""anything goes"" position of cultural relativism pushed to absurdity, they also must avoid the pitfall of judging the practices of other cultures in terms of ethno¬centric criteria."
6286,一个仍然有用的公式是由人类学家沃尔特˙戈德施米特在40余年前发明的。,A still useful formula for this was devised more than 40 years ago by anthropologist Walter Goldschmidt.
6286,在他看来，要问的重要问题是，特定文化怎么能满足由它指导其行为的那些人的物质和心理需要？,In his view the important question to ask is: How well does a given culture satisfy the physical and psychological needs of those whose behavior it guides?
6286,具体的指标在于它的人口的营养状态、一般身体和精神健康方面、暴力的发生、犯罪和违法行为、人口结构、稳定和家庭生活的安宁以及群体与其资源环境基础的关系。,"Specific indicators are found in the nutritional status and general physical and mental health of its population; the incidence of violence, crime, and delinquency; the demographic structure; the stability and tranquility of domestic life; and the group's relationship to its resource base."
6287,把文化当成是“人性”之简单而直接的表现，或者依据诸如挫伤、为亲人所遗弃和婴儿在哺乳期的心灵创伤经历之类的心理机制来解释文化，仍然是普遍的情况。,"It is still common to regard culture as a simple and direct expression of ""human nature"" or to explain it in terms of psychological mechanisms such as frustration, rejection of the father, or the traumatic experiences of bottle feeding in infancy."
6287,另一方面，在认识精神活动中文化决定因素的作用方面也是普遍地不成功的。,"On the other hand, there is a very general failure to recognize the operation of cultural determinants of mind."
6287,我们试图澄淸在意识与文化、心理学与文化学之间的基本区别。,"We try to make clear the fundamental distinction between mind and culture, between psychology and culturology."
6288,文化相对主义有时被放置在我族中心主义的对立面，该学说认为：各种社会和文化的性质有差异，都有其自身独特的内部逻辑，因而用一种衡量尺度对它们进行排列从科学上来说是荒谬的。,"Cultural relativism is sometimes posited as the opposite of ethnocentrism.This is the doctrine that societies or cultures are qualitatively different and have their own unique inner logic, and that it is therefore scientifically absurd to rank them on a scale."
6288,比如，某人将桑人置于一个等级的最底部，这里的变量，比如说是受教育程度和年收入，如果事实证明桑人自己并没有将金钱和读书看得多么重要，那么这个等级对于他们来说就是无关的。,"If one places a San group, say, at the bottom of a ladder where the variables are, say, literacy and annual income, this ladder is irrelevant to them if it turns out that the San do not place a high priority on money and books."
6288,同样，不证自明，在这样一个文化相对主义者的研究框架中，你不能认为一个汽车较多的社会比那些汽车较少的社会“更好”，或者认为电影院相对于人口的比率是一个观测生活质量的有用的指示器。,"It should also be evident that one cannot, within a cultural relativist framework, argue that a society with many cars is ""better"" than one with fewer, or that the ratio of cinemas to population is a useful indicator of the quality of life."
6289,原因是很清楚的。,The reason is fairly plain.
6289,“宿命论”意指自由意志，而“失败主义” 意指全知全能。,"""Fatalism"" implies Free Will; ""defeatism,"" omnipotence."
6289,当原子、细胞或组织依照自身本性和特征活动时，没有人称之为宿命论，因为没有人指望它们有自由选择与行动的自由。,"When atoms, cells, or tissues behave in accordance with their nature and properties no one calls it fatalistic because no one expects freedom of choice and action of them."
6289,但是当人们宣称，文化现象有其自身本性，因而必定依据其自身本性而活动时，对此的反应不是承认这是因果性原则，而是指责它为宿命论。伟大的人类学家E˙爰德华˙泰勒多年之前就已写道：“对许多有教养的人来说，下列观点似乎是自以为是和使人反感的，即人类历史是自然史的一个部分，我们的思想、意愿和行动遵循着规律，正如波浪运动、酸、醎化合与植物生长为规律所支配-样……如果某处有规律，那么，处处都有规律。,"But when one asserts that cultural phenomena have a nature of their own and consequently must behave in terms of their nature, the response is not an acceptance of the principle of cause and effect but a charge of ""fatalism."" ""To many educated minds/' the great English anthropologist, E. B. Tylor,wrote many years ago, ""there seems something presumptuous and repulsive in the view that the history of mankind is part and parcel of the history of nature, that our thoughts, wills, and actions accord with laws as definite as those which govern the motion of the waves, the combination of acids and bases, and the growth of plants ...If law is anywhere it is everywhere."

6290,现代化是一个种族中心主义的术语，它用来指一种全球性的变迁过程，在此过程中，传统的、非工业社会努力去获得“先进的”工业社会的诸种特质。,"Modernization is an ethnocentric term referring to a global process of change by which traditional, nonindustrial societies seek to acquire characteristics of industrially ""advanced"" societies."
6290,尽管现代化一般被假设成是一件好事，也确有某些成功之处，但它往往导致一种新的“不满文化”，希望水准远远超过个人当地的机会。,"Although modernization generally has been assumed to be a good thing, and some successes have occurred, it frequently has led to the development of a new ""culture of discontent"", a level of aspirations far exceeding the bounds of an individual's local opportunities."
6290,有时，现代化还导致人们不愿抛弃的价值和习俗遭到摧毁。,Sometimes it leads to the destruction of cherished customs and values people had no desire to abandon.
6291,然而，乡村牧歌的历史渊源却不容易分辨出来。,
6291,,And yet the historical source of the idyll is not so easy to isolate.
6291,例如，艾登（Eden在1977年曾经赞美了英格兰北部健壮的农民的美德、智慧和独立，相比之下，情况类似的人口稠密的南方，农民却在寻求帮助和慈善 捐助（引自Dewhirstl972: I)，而晚至1890年，果美（Gomme)还将农村描述成在文明的发展下必须要打破的“原始因素”（1890:232)。,"Thus, Eden can be found celebrating, in 1797, the virtue, intelligence and independence of the healthy peasant of England's North Country as compared with those who seek help and charity in the more familiar regions of the populous South (cited in Dewhirst 1972:1), while as late as 1890 Gomme is to be found describing the village as a ""primitive element"", of necessity broken under the advance of civilization (1890:232)."
6291,显然，“乡村”和“城市”的观念的使用是个別的和复杂的，包括很多其他问题（地理距离的问题，或南北英国的对比），而不是简单的在城市化的进程中对乡村生活进行的总括性的确认。,"Clearly, the uses to which notions of the ""rural"" and the ""urban"" are put are several and complex, and more issues are involved (the question of geographical distance, or of south Britain versus north) than simply a blanket validation of country life at the growth of urbanization."
6292,哈金得出结论认为，思想家们频繁地纠正事物、解决问题、确立真理。,"Hacking draws the conclusion that thinkers frequently got things right, solved problems, and established truths."
6292,但是，他指出，这并不意味着我们应当追求一种统一的波普尔式的真理王国，而是像保罗˙费耶阿本德(Paul Feyerabend)那样，我们应尽可能地让我们的选择公开接受质询。,"But, he argues, this does not imply that we should search for a unified Popperian realm of the true; rather, a la Paul Feyerabend, we should keep our options in inquiry as open as possible."
6292,哈金提醒我们，古希腊人没有统计学的槪念，并且从未使用过统计方法，这一事实既未使古希腊科学、也未使统计学失去其价值。,"The Greeks, Hacking reminds us, had no concept, or use, of statistics, a fact that invalidates neither Greek science nor statistics as such."
6292,这一立场并不是相对主义的，但也不是经验主义的。,"This position is not relativism, but it is not imperialism either."
6292,"罗蒂将他眼中的这一切命名为解释学，哈金则称其为“无政府的理性主义""（Amrcho-rationdism)。",Rorty calls his version of all this hermeneutics.Hacking calls his anarcho-rationalism.
6292,无政府的理性主义是把“对他人的宽容与自身的真理和理性标准相结合”(第65页）。,"""Anarcho-rationalism is tolerance for other people combined with the discipline of one's own standards of truth and reason"" (65)."
6292,在此，让我们将其称为良善的科学。,Let us call it good science.
6293,因为一个不幸的事实是，在未来的许多年里，一些人类学家将有可能不得不试图去理解通常用“种族暴力”来表达的政治暴力。,"For it is a sad fact that many anthropologists will probably have to try to understand political violence, frequently expressed as ""ethnic violence"", in many years to come."
6293,从其目标是理解文化和社会的不同方面之间的相互关系来说，人类学是一门整体学科。,Anthropology is a holistic discipline in the sense that it aims at an understanding of the interrelationships between different aspects of culture and society.
6293,后面的几章会将这些初步的见识用到政治过程中去，并且深入发展它们。,Later chapters draw on these preliminary insights into political processes and develop them further.
6293,与意识形态、权力和合法化有关的问题被再度提起，而复杂的国家社会中的政治会被进一步探究。,"Questions to do with ideology, power and legitimation are returned to, and politics in complex state societies are also explored further."
6293,下一章，涉及交换和消费，因而结合了政治和经济两个角度。,"The next chapter, which deals with exchange and consumption, therefore integrates perspectives on politics with perspectives on economy."
6294,虽然想法是使一只贝壳的大小和价值配得上另一只，但是人们全凭他们的谈判技巧、物质资源和巫术技能，获得与最强有力的伙伴接触的权利，而且得到最贵重的贝壳。因此，要是一个人使贝壳从其正确的“路径”偏移，或者诱使他人去争夺他也许不得不提供的俜镯或者项圈，那么消极互惠的因素就产生了。,"Although the idea is to match the size and value of one shell for another, men draw on all their negotiating skills, material resources, and magical expertise to gain access to the strongest partners and most valuable shells; thus, an element of negative reciprocity arises when a man diverts shells from their proper ""paths"" or entices others to compete for whatever necklaces and armbands he may have to offer."
6294,不过，成功毕竟还是受到限制，因为尽管一个人可以保留贝壳5年或10年，它迟早得转到他人之手。,"But when all is said and done, success is limited, for although a man may keep a shell for 5 or 10 years, sooner or later it must be passed on to others."
6295,在这种精神的光照之下，让我回到眼下的这本书。,"In this spirit, let me turn to the present volume."
6295,每个人都能够想出那些本该被涵括的个人或视角。,Everyone will be able to think of individuals or perspectives that should have been included.
6295,本书的焦点限制了它，这种限制的途径只有从一开始才能通过作者和编者得以明晰。,The volume's focus limits it in ways its authors and editors can only begin to make apparent.
6295,读者可能会注意到，它的对人类学的偏见使它忽略了照片、电影、表演理论、纪录片艺木、非虚构小说、“新新闻写作”、口述史以及各种形式的社会学。,"Readers may note that its anthropological bias neglects photography, film, performance theory, documentary art, the nonfiction novel, ""the new journalism,"" oral history, and various forms of sociology."
6295,本书对从非西方经验和女性主义理论与政治中兴起的新的民族志的可能性相对关注较少。,The book gives relatively little attention to new ethnographic possibilities emerging from non-Western experience and from feminist theory and politics.
6295,让我再详细说说被排除的这最后一条，因为它关系到产生这些文章的大学环境所具有的知识和道德方面的强大影响。,"Let me dwell on this last exclusion, for it concerns an especially strong intellectual and moral influence in the university milieux from which these essays have sprung."
6296,因此，当文化形式“凝固”且变得独立时，就会从创造它们的力量中分离出来，使得世界中充满着习惯，而个体也就会创造出新的形式，为世界带来进一步的变化和变变迁。,"Hence, as cultural forms ""congeal"" and become independent, detached from the energies which produced them, and fill the world with habit, individuals are also creating new forms, and causing a world of further heterogeneity and flux."
6296,无法融于旧形式的新力量就会创造出新形式。,"New energies, not incorporatable within old forms, create new forms."
6296,在形式的混乩中要发生这些，首先要求，个体有可能在众多相互竞争的选择中（宗教和科学；弗洛伊德和荣格的心理分析；积家、阿曼尼和马莎的服饰；曼城、曼联、狼队和希伯尼安等足球队）进行筛选；并且把这些形式按照一定的顺序和频率组织起来，形成新的产成品（拉康心理分析；朋克服饰）。,"This happens as, first, amid the clutter of forms, individuals have the possibility of choosing between a number of often competing options (religion and science; Freudian and Jungian psychoanalysis; Jaeger, Armani and St Michael tailoring; Manchester City, Man. Utd, Wolves and Hibernian football); and also of putting these forms together in a sequence and frequency which amounts to a new bricolage (Lacanian psychoanalysis; Punk tailoring)."
6297,在分层社会中，流动程度与占支配地位类型的家庭组织有关。,The degree of mobility in a stratified society is related to the prevailing kind of family organization.
6297,在扩大家庭最常见的社会中，流动通常是困难的，因为每个个体都牢牢依附于大家庭群体。,"In societies where the extended family is the usual form, mobility is apt to be difficult, because each individual is strongly tied to the large family group."
6297,因此，如 果一个人想要上升到更高的社会阶级，他或她的家庭也必须同时向上流动。,"Hence, for a person to move up to a higher social class, his or her family must move up as well."
6297,流动对于独立的核心家庭来说要容易一些，因为在这种家庭中，个体只与少数人紧密相 连。,Mobility is easier for independent nuclear families where the individual is closely tied to fewer persons.
6297,此外，在新居制下，个体在正常情况下会离开他们出生之家。,"Moreover, under neolocal residence, individuals normally leave the family they were born into."
6298,现代描写语言学的长处之一是其方法的客观性。,One of the strengths of modern descriptive linguistics is the objectivity of its methods.
6298,擅长这一方法的人类学家研究一门语言，不会抱有这种观念，即该语言必定有名词、动词、介词或在英语中可辨别的其他形式类。,"A descriptive linguist does not approach a language with the idea that it must have nouns, verbs, prepositions, or any other of the form classes identifiable in English."
6298,相反，他或她看到在该语言中出现的东西，而且试图根据它自己的内在作用把它描写出来。,The linguist instead sees what turns up in the language and makes an attempt to describe it in terms of its own inner workings.
6298,为方便起见，把近似于英语名词和动词表现的词素称为名词和动词，但如果有人认为那种名称会引起误解，那么它们就可能被称为“x-词”和“y-词”，或“A形式类”和“B形式类”。,"For convenience, morphemes that behave approximately like English nouns and verbs may be labeled as such, but if the terms would be misleading, the linguist instead might call them ""x-words"", and ""y-words"" or ""form class A"" and ""form class B""."
6299,为了这些头人的盛宴创造出剩余物品，其目的在于获得威望，因而有威望经济(prestige economy)这一术语，它指通过财富展市和礼物的慷慨赠送而获得威望。,"For these Big Man feasts, a surplus is created for the express purpose of gaining prestige through a display of wealth and generous giving of gifts."
6299,但是，与西方社会的炫耀性消费不同，它的着重点不在于物品的积累，积累的物品是他人不可利用的。,"But, unlike conspicuous consumption in Western societies, the emphasis is not on the hoarding of goods, which would make them unavailable to others."
6299,"相反,它的着重点在于赠送，或至少是把某人的财富处理掉。","Instead, the emphasis is on giving away, or at least getting rid of, one's wealth goods."
6299,因此，这些盛宴起到调整机制的作用，防止某些个人在损害社会其他成员的情况下积累过多的财富。,"Thus, these feasts serve as a leveling mechanism, preventing some individuals from accumulating too much wealth at the expense of other society members."
6300,继嗣群体通常楚高度结构化了的经济单位，为其成员提供援助和安全。,Descent groups are often highly structured economic units that provide aid and security to their members.
6300,它们还可能是宗教传统的宝库，它通过对共同袓先的崇拜增强群体团结。,"They also may be repositories of religious tradition, with group solidarity enhanced by worship of a common ancestor."
6300,世系群是法人继嗣群体，它由血缘亲属组成，他们与一个共同的祖先具有系谱联系。,A lineage is a corporate descent group made up of consanguineal kin who can trace their genealogical links to a common ancestor.
6300,因为世系群一般实行外婚制，所以群体内部的性竞争在很大程度上得以避免。,"Since lineages are commonly exogamous, sexual competition within the group is largely avoided."
6300,此外，群体成员的婚姻代表两个世系群之间的联盟。,"In addition, marriage of a group member represents an alliance of two lineages."
6300,世系群外婚制还有助于维持一个社会内部的开放交流，并在世系群之间促成信息的交换。,Lineage exogamy also serves to maintain open communication within a society and fosters the exchange of information among lineages.
6301,直到最近，人们还认为，在这些地区的寻食生活是困难的，一个人要生存下去，就得艰苦地劳动。,Until recently it was assumed that a food-foraging life in these areas was difficult and that one had to work hard just to stay alive.
6301,这种观点的根据是西方人的进步观念，虽然这已作为自然事实被普遍接受，但实际上这不过是受文化制约的偏见。,"Behind this view lies the Western notion of progress, which, although widely accepted as a fact of nature, is actually nothing more than a culturally conditioned bias."
6301,这一观念使我们倾向于把新的东西看作一般比旧的东西更可取，而就现实的人类历史而言，或多或少被看作是沿着演化的进步阶梯稳步向上攀登的。,This predisposes one to see what is new as generally preferable to what is old and to read human history as a more-or-less steady climb up an evolutionary ladder of progress.
6301,因此，如果寻食作为一种生活方式比工业文明更古老（事实就是如此），那么后者必定在本质上比前者更好。,"Thus, many assume that because food foraging as a way of life is much older than industrial civilization, the latter must be intrinsically better than the former."
6302,社会阶级结构的基础是角色分化。,The basis of social class structure is role differentiation.
6302,当然，某些角色分化存在于任何一个社会，至少有依据性别和年龄的分化。,"Some role differentiation, of course, exists in any society, at least along the lines of sex and age."
6302,此外，任何必要的角色总会在某种程度上受到重视。,"Furthermore, any necessary role always will be valued to some degree."
6302,在寻食社会中，“好猎人”的角色将会受到重视。,"In a food-foraging society, the role of ""good hunter"" will be valued."
6302,但是，在一个平等社会中，已经有一个人承担了那个角色这一事实，并不阻碍另一个人承担它因此，角色分化本身并不足以造成分层。,"The fact one man already may play that role does not, however, prevent another man from playing it, too, in an egalitarian society.Therefore, role differentiation by itself is not sufficient for stratification."
6302,还有两个必要条件：对角色的正式评价——这种评价包含像喜欢一厌恶、崇敬一反感这样的态度，以及对有较高评价角色的获得机会的限制。,"Two more ingredients are necessary: formalized evaluation of roles, involving attitudes such as like/dislike, or admiration/revulsion, and restricted access to the more highly valued roles."
6303,除了对野孩子、野人及高尚的野蛮人的传奇式关注之外，孟德斯鸠、圣西门和奥古斯特•孔德等人体现了持续的社会学传统。,"Standing somewhat apart from the romantic concerns with feral children, Orang Outangs, and noble savages was the sociological tradition embodied by Montesquieu, Saint-Simon, and Comte."
6303,与此同时，苏格兰启蒙运动的继承人就“种族”之间的生物关系发生了激烈争论。,"Paralleling this, successors to the Scottish Enlightenment argued vehemently over the biological relationships between the ‘races’."
6303,这两个发展进程都在19世纪和20世纪的人类学中留下了自己的印记。,Both of these developments were to leave their mark in nineteenth- and twentieth-century anthropology.
6304,虽然在当代世界一夫一妻制和一夫多妻制是最普遍的婚姻形式，但是也有其他的婚姻形式存在，尽管很少见。,"Although monogamy and polygyny are the most common forms of marriage in the world today, other forms do occur, however rarely."
6304,一妻多夫制（polyandry），即一个女子同时与两个或多个男子的婚姻，只在儿个社会中见到，部分原因或许是男子的预期寿命比女子的短，而且男婴的死亡率高，所以在一个社会中男子过剩是不大可能的。,"Polyandry, the marriage of one woman to two or more men simultaneously, is known in only a few societies, perhaps in part because men's life expectancy is shorter than women's, and male infant mortality is high, so a surplus of men in a society is unlikely."
6304,在性别 比例平衡的地方，如在拉达克人的社会中，许多妇女可能一直不结婚。,"Where sex ratios are balanced, as in Ladakh, many women are likely to remain unmarried."
6304,一妻多夫制少见的另一个原因，是这种婚姻形式比任何其他形式更加限制一个男子的后代。,Another reason for polyandry rarity is that it limits a man's descendants more than any other pattern.
6304,然而，在纳亚尔人中，一妻多夫制使女子怀孕的机会最大化，确保其继嗣群体孩子的生育。,
6305,依附训练有助于使这些潜在的问题得到控制，它包括支持方面和惩罚方面。,Dependence training helps to keep these potential problems under control and involves both supportive and punitive aspects.
6305,在支持方面，对年幼的孩子们表示纵容，特别是以长期的口头满足形式加以纵容。,"On the supportive side, indulgence is shown to young children, particularly in the form of prolonged oral gratification."
6305,喂奶持续几年时间而且实际上有要求就给予满足。,Nursing continues for several years and is virtually on demand.
6305,这可以解释为奖励孩子在家庭内部寻求支持，家庭是满足儿童需要的主要代理人。,"This may be interpreted as rewarding the child for seeking support within the family, the main agent in meeting the child needs."
6305,另外，在支持的方面，孩子们在相当小的年龄就会分配给一些照顾孩子和家庭的任务，这对家庭的福利有重要的和明显的贡献。,"Also on the supportive side, children at a relatively early age are assigned a number of child-care and domestic tasks, all of which make significant and obvious contributions to the family's welfare."
6306,第一代移民经常表现出原生的“族裔文化”（语言、习惯、宗教、家庭模式、饮食和音乐等）。,"The first generation of immigrants used to come with a pristine ""ethnic culture"" (language, customs, religion, family patterns, diet, music etc)."
6306,在这些文化中，不同身份的社交圈（教区的、族裔的和宗教的）没有达到敌对的程度：认同被作为整体“体验”着。,"In these cultures the different circles of identity (parochial, ethnic, national, religious) were not perceived as antagonist levels: identity was ""experienced"" as a whole."
6306,然而，在移民过程中，这些不同层次的认同有可能产生冲突。,"Nevertheless, in the process of immigration these different levels might come into conflict."
6307,迈克尔˙阿伦的《亚拉腊山之行》（Arlen 1975)作为一个原型文本展示了族群的“移情”机制，以及如何与类本我（id-like)力量——它定义自我，不过是从外部——达成妥协。,"Michael Alien's Passage to Ararat (1975) is an archetypical text for displaying the ""transference"" mechanisms of ethnicity, and for coming to terms with an id-like force, experienced as defining one's self, yet coming from without."
6307,在这里，关键是克服焦虑——焦虑通过行为模式的仿效表现出来，它不能通过理性语言表达，而只能以行动表现。,"Crucial here is the conquest of an anxiety that manifests itself through repetition of behavioral patterns, and that cannot be articulated in rational language but can only be acted out."
6307,此处它与之类比的是心理分析治疗的三种常规交流模式之三，这三种模式包括：认知的、理性的、有意识的调查；将梦转译为线性的像文本一样的言辞表现形式（因此引进了媒介语言的扭曲）：移情，其中没文本的生产，而是将以前确立的、对先前某个重要的他人的行为模式重复运用到心理分析医师身上。,"The analogy here is with the third of the three modes of communication routinely distinguished in psychoanalytic therapy: cognitive, rational, conscious investigation; translation from dreams into linear, textlike verbalizations (thereby introducing the distortions of the mediating language); and transference, in which no text is produced, but rather a repetition toward the analyst of behavior patterns previously established toward some prior significant other."
6308,另一部分使用符号的能力是移置作用：指称不在场的事物或事件的能力。这是一个重要的指标，当符号指称的对象不在场的时候，它们也是可以在头脑中保持的精神观念。,Another component of the capacity to use symbols is displacement: the ability to refer to things or events not present It is an important indicator that symbols are also mental representations that can be held in the mind when the objects to which they refer are not present.
6308,这是在人类语言演化中极其重要的发展，因为它使个体从当下的环境中解放出来，而且使我们的祖先能够谈论久远的时代和遥远的地方。,This was an extremely important development in the evolution of human language because it freed individuals from the immediate environment and allowed our ancestors to talk about distant times and places.
6308,当钱特克2岁时，它开始用手势表示不在场的东西。,"When he was two years old, Chantek began to sign for things that were not present."
6308,"它经常要求去它的院子的一些地点寻找一些动物, 如它的宠物松鼠和它作为玩伴的猫。","He frequently asked to go to places in his yard to look for animals, such as his pet squirrel and cat who served as playmates."
6308,它也提出要“冰淇淋”的请求，打手势示意“驾车”，并拉我们去停车场，去当地的冰淇淋店。,"He also made requests for ""ICE CREAM"" signing ""CAR RIDE"" and pulling us toward the parking lot for a trip to a local ice-cream shop."
6309,在一些社会，长子比其他子女会继承更大部分的遗产（长子继承制）；另一些社会遵循相反的准则，对幼子给以优先权（幼子继承制）。,In some societies the eldest son receives a larger part of the inheritance than his siblings (primogeniture); others follow the opposite principle and give priority to the youngest son (ultimogeniture).
6309,当团体准则用一种整合的方式发挥功能时，遗产是一种潜在分裂的根源，因为它揭示了亲属之间的利益冲突。,"Whereas the corporate principle functions in an integrating way, inheritance is a source of potential disruption, since it reveals conflicts of interest among the relatives."
6309,继承的规则常与继嗣关系紧密相连，在父系继嗣系统，儿子（或弟弟）常会接管已故者的义务；在母系继嗣系统，男子一般继承他的舅舅。,"Rules of succession are often closely linked with the principle of descent.In patrilineal systems, a son (or a younger brother) will frequently take over the commitments of the deceased; in matrilineal systems, a man commonly succeeds his mother's brother."
6309,但是，必须记住，有多种继承形式并不完全依照家系原则。比如，在有些社会，首领和巫师的任命或选举是在个人才能的基础上进行的。,"However, it should be remembered that many forms of succession do not follow genealogical principles at all, for example in societies where chiefs and shamans are appointed or elected on the basis of personal merit."
6309,雅诺马马人和一些其他小型社会中就是这样。,This is the case among the Yanomamö and in many other small-scale societies.
6310,4. 丹尼尔·丹尼特（Daniel Dennett），《被解释的意识》（1991）：大脑是一个“预测机器”，根据“平行分布的程序”规则运作。,"4 Daniel Dennett, Consciousness Explained (1991): the brain is an ‘anticipation machine’, working on a principle of ‘parallel distributed processing’."
6310,意识是一种幻象，是一系列的“多元转换”的提升，并不存在“叙事重心”，也没有连续性。,"Consciousness is an illusion, a series of shifting ‘multiple drafts’ with no ‘centre of narrative gravity’ and no continuity."
6310,不存在笛卡尔所谓的心灵剧场使“我是”汇集在一起；而且感官经验和看待事物的方式远不是不可言说或完全主观性的。,
6310,,"There is no Cartesian theatre where ‘I am’ comes together; moreover, the qualia of experience, the way things seem, are far from ineffable or merely subjective."
6311,这样，我们看到，在超有机体的文化传统与智能的生物因素之间可以建立起一种关系，这种关系我们表述如下：CxB=P。其中，C代表文化传统；B代表智能的生物因素；P代表产生某种发明与犮现的概率。,"We see then that a relationship can be established between the extra-somatic cultural tradition and the biological factor of mental ability which we can express thus: C X B = P, in which C stands for the cultural tradition, B for the biological factor of mental ability, and P for the probability of a certain invention or discovery taking place."
6311,在其他因素不变的情况下，只要提高C或B，这个概率就会提高。,The probability is increased if either C or B is increased while the other factor remains constant.
6312,波思拉的一个引起争议的结论是：农业社会中女人的政治地位在引入新技术以后一般会衰落，因为这种技术常常是被男人所控制。,"Boserup's controversial conclusion is that the political position of women in farming societies is generally weakened when new technology is introduced, since this technology tends to be controlled by men."
6312,此外，土地也常常由男人控制。,"In addition, land is usually controlled by men."
6312,波思拉认为，当女人的经济贡献消失以后，她们的地位就会减弱，这却是一个棘手的论题。,Boserup argues that the position of women is weakened when their economic contribution diminishes; this is nevertheless a thorny issue.
6312,因为，经济贡献是什么呢？,For what is an economic contribution?
6312,正如所显示的那样，搜集粮草可能没有打猎那么壮观，也较少被仪式化和被谈论（就像工业社会中的家务劳动一样），但这无疑也是一种经济贡献。,"As indicated, foraging may be less spectacular than hunting, and less ritualised and talked about (just like housework in industrial societies), but it is an economic contribution nonetheless."
6312,下面的例子可以描述性别、经济和意识形态领域以及权力之间的关系。,"The following example may illustrate the relationship between gender relations, the economy and the realm of ideology and power."
6313,安德鲁•斯特拉森和帕梅拉•斯图尔特 ( Pamela Stewart) (Strath­ em and Stewart 1998 ) 把体现与交流相比，作为理解仪式的一种方式。,Andrew Strathern and Pamela Stewart (1998) compare embodiment to communication as modes for the understanding of ritual.
6313,按他们的话说，体现观点强调仪式对行为人假定的影响，而交流观点 则强调籵会情境以及与仪式所指向的精神权力有关的情境。,"In their terms, the embodiment perspective emphasizes the putative effects of ritual on the performers, while the communication perspective emphasizes the social context and the context involving the spiritual powers to which the rituals are directed."
6313,"他们的定 义很明确：“广义地说，我们用体现这一术语指身体内部和贯穿身体 的某些社会价值和控制的支柱…..."" (1998:  237) 。","Their definition is quite straightforward: ‘In the broadest sense, we take the term embodiment to refer to the anchoring of certain social values and dispositions in and through the body . . .’ (1998: 237)."
6314,继派克开创性的著作后，人类学家试图把音素/客位和音位/主位两个范畴之间的关系确定下来。,"After Pike’s pioneering work, anthropologists tried to formalize the relation between emic and etic categories."
6314,于是发展了一系列复杂方法，并对此进行反复讨论。,Complex methodologies were developed and debated.
6314,沃德•古迪纳夫发表了一篇著名文章（Goode- rnnigh 1956)，讨论密克罗尼西亚特鲁克（Truk)群岛居民的亲属关系术语。随后使一些人开始转而注意亲属关系。,"Following Ward Goodenough’s (1956) famous paper on the relationship terminology of the inhabitants of the Truk Islands of Micronesia, several turned their attention to kinship."
6314,亲属关系术语大概是文化各领域中最能体现音位/主位结构的。,Emic structures are probably more transparent in relationship terminologies than in any other cultural domain.
6315,以这个简单的身份分配作为研究的起始点，巴思描述了船上的角色扮演。,"With this simple status distribution as his point of departure, Barth describes the role play on the ship."
6315,他展示了身份中的某些方面是如何被过度传达的，即，行动者在他们的印象管理中，过于强调展示的那些方面。,"He shows how certain aspects of the statuses are overcommunicated; that is, the actors place great emphasis on presenting these aspects in their impression management."
6315,船长表现得像是一个具有丰富的经验和正确的判断力的强壮男人的样子；渔民们时不时地在甲板上集中，观察一下海面，低声交谈几句，表现出他们积极工作的意愿；担任“魔术师”角色的渔网指挥给人的印象是，他被赋予了有点神秘来头的巨大的直觉能力，他观察着别人看不到的天气迹象、不停地徘徊，使劲地“嗅出”鱼的信息，等等。,"The captain acts as a sturdy man with immense experience and a sound sense of judgement.The fishermen frequently gather on deck, watch the ocean and talk quietly together to display their willingness to do a good job.The netboss, who plays the ""trickster"" role, gives the impression of being endowed with great intuitive powers of partly mystical origins; he watches the weather for signs which are invisible to others, wanders restlessly about ""sniffing"" for fish, and so on."
6315,在这情景中，通过对角色的特定方面的审慎的过度传达，所有的行动者都竭尽全力地表现为完全胜任自己的身份。,"In this situation, through deliberate overcommunication of certain role aspects, all the actors do their best to present themselves as fully competent carriers of their status."
6316,"而另一些基督教教堂的牧师在参加仪式时穿黑袍子,平时穿花袍子。","In other Christian churches, the equivalent person may wear black when engaged in ritual activities and ordinary, multi-coloured clothes otherwise."
6316,在这里，穿白色还是穿黑色不仅仅是文化所能决定的，它还取决于一些相当具体的带有文化意义的行为。,Thewearing of white or black in these cases is not only culture-dependent; it is also dependent on very specific culturally significant activities.
6316,这也正是英国结构主义与列维-斯特劳斯结构主义的分歧所在。因为前者既强调社会各文化之间和符号结构上存在的共性，也强调文化的多样性。而后者则从人类心理一致性出发，强调文化的普遍性。,"This is where British structuralism, which emphasizes cultural diversity as well as cross-cultural commonalities of social and symbolic structures, parts company with Le ́vi-Straussian structuralism with its emphasis on cultural universals embedded in the psychic unity of humankind."
6317,而来自一个上层阶级的人也许会故意选择一种比习惯的生活方式要简单的生活方式：他或她也许开一辆破破烂烂的大众牌汽车，而不是一辆梅塞德斯牌汽车。,"For that matter, someone from an upper class deliberately may choose a simpler lifestyle than is customary.Instead of driving a Mercedes, he or she may drive a beat-up Volkswagen."
6317,符号标志必然包含生活方式的因素，但生活机会的差异也可能反映阶级地位的不同。,"Symbolic indicators involve factors of lifestyle, but differences in life chances also may signal differences in class standing."
6317,相对于下层阶级的成员来说，上层阶级成员的生活一般没那么困难。,Life is apt to be less hard for members of an upper class as opposed to a lower class.
6317,这一点反映在上层阶级较低的婴儿死亡率和较长的预期寿命这一趋势之中。,This shows up in a tendency for lower infant mortality and longer life expectancy for the upper class.
6317,还存在这样一种趋势：上层阶级的人通常身材更高，身体也更结实，原因是他们的饮食更健康，并在少年时期避免了严重的疾病。,"Another tendency is for greater physical stature and robustness among upper-class people, the result of better diet and protection from serious illness in their juvenile years."
6318,在一个电视节目上，一位知名的评论员在抗议种族偏见中恰恰展示了熟悉的种族偏见。她说道：早期电影显示了对“犹太种族”有偏见的描述。,"On a television program, a well-known commentator displayed a familiar racial bias in the very act of protesting racial bias; she stated that early movies showed jaundiced portrayals of members of the ""Jewish race""."
6318,显然，她没有意识到犹太教是一个宗教和文化分类，而不是一种族分类，因为它包括各种各样的类型的代表。,"Apparently she did not realize that Judaism is a religious and cultural category rather than a racial one, because it includes representatives of a variety of physical types."
6319,尽管在语言趋异过程中发生的许多变化是众所周知的，但它们的原因却不为人所知。,"While many of the changes that have occurred in the course of linguistic divergence are well known, their causes are not."
6319,促使语言变化的一种力量是一种语言从另一种语言中借用词汇，在能够这样做时，各种语言都很容易做到；但是如果促使变化的唯一力量是借用，那么可以预计，随着时间的推移，语言的差异会越来越不显著。,"One force for linguistic change is borrowing from another language, something speakers readily do when in a position to do so; but if borrowing were the sole force for change, linguistic differences would be expected to become less pronounced through time."
6319,通过研究在其文化环境中的现代语言，人们就能逐渐明白促使语言变化的各种力量。,"By studying modern languages in their cultural settings, linguists can begin to understand the forces for change."
6319,这种力量之一是新颖、纯粹和简洁。,"One such force is novelty, pure and simple."
6320,在特纳的仪式研究中，他对过渡仪式的论述最广为人知。,"Regarding his studies of ritual, Turner is particularly known for his treatment of rites of passage."
6320,这里，他特别注意到了阈限阶段，这是他认为的关键（例如在《仪式过程》[The Ritual Process，1969]）。,"Here, he has called attention to the liminal phase, which he regards as crucial (for example in The Ritual Process, 1969)."
6320,特纳描述了被阈限所赋予的不同状态之间的转换，这一转换是不同社会整合形式间的一种动态的相互影响，也就是正式的社会（societas）和非正式的社区（communitas)。,"Turner has described the transition between different states entailed by liminality as a dynamic interplay between different forms of social integration, namely the formal societas and the informal communitas."
6320,对于特纳来说，仪式是社会形式的一种浓缩的表达方式。他认为，通过详细地研究它们，你就可以从总体上对于社会和个人加以综述。,"To Turner, rituals are condensed expressions of a social form: through studying them in great detail, he has argued, one may make statements about society and individuals in general."
6320,其他人类学家后来也试图应用特纳的洞见和有关阈限的概念，将社会和社区纳入语境，而不仅仅是纯粹的仪式的背景。,"Other anthropologists have later tried to apply Turner's insights and concepts about liminality, societas and communitas to contexts other than the purely ritual ones."
6321,元信息传递主要有两种：一类涉及解码系统，另一类涉及共享这套代码系统并以此交流的人之间的关系。,"Metacommunications may be divided into two main kinds: those concerning the system of codification, and those concerning the interpersonal relations of those who share the system of codification and seek to communicate through it."
6321,因此，礼貌或尊敬、谦虚或恭顺的语调，都在暗示某些元信息：阐明了使用同…代码系统的人以某种代码使用方式所表达的人际关系。,"Hence, terms of courtesy or respect, intonations of condescension or dependence, are metacommunicative cues: statements about the relations between users of a code contained in the way the code is used."
6321,另一类则在暗示何为诙谐、何为讽刺、机密、非正式等等。,"Other cues will indicate what is jocular, what is ironic, what is secret, what is informal, and so on."
6322,不过，在世纪之交的时候，他们大多数人主要地还是依靠园艺农业维持生存，虽然金钱的部分正在变得越来越重要。,"Nevertheless, at the turn of the millennium most of them chiefly live off subsistence horticulture, although the monetary sector is becoming increasingly important."
6322,雅诺马马人的近期历史中的一个更加悲剧的部分是麻疹之类的疾病的流行，这种疾病对于欧洲人来说相对无害，但是对于远离人群、原先未得过这种病的群体来说却是致命的。,"A more tragic part of recent Yanomamö history has been the spread of diseases such as measles, relatively harmless to Europeans but deadly to isolated, formerly unexposed groups."
6322,至于蒙都鲁库人（在巴西），早在1950年代，他们就打算进入一种资本主义的经济体系。,"As for the Mundurucú (Brazil), as early as the 1950s they were about to be drawn into a capitalist economic system."
6322,一些村民依靠在橡胶种植园的工资生活，而在这种环境下他们的定居模式也发生了变化：男人们的屋子没有了，男人和妻子、孩子以核心家庭的方式住在一起。,"Several of the villages depended on wagework on rubber plantations, and in this setting their pattern of settlement was changed: the men’s house was gone, and men lived with their wives and children in nuclear families."
6323,"在那时，非洲东南部的环境是,开阔的田野镶嵌着小块封闭的林地。","Unlike other early hominines, Ardipithecus lived in a woodland environment, so it may represent an aberrant side branch of human evolution."
6323,虽然阿迪皮特卡斯死在这些被围地方的一处，但是所有其他早期的原人居住在比较开阔的田野，归属于这一或那一原人属的种（参见图3.4)。,All others inhabited more open country and are assigned to one or another species of the genus Australopithecus (Figure 3.4).
6323,正是关于那里存在多少种，存在着观点的分歧。为了简洁起见，我们只把它们统称为南方古猿（Australopithecines）（字面意思是“南方的猿”）就够了。,"Opinions vary on just how many species existed; for the sake of simplicity, it suffices for our purposes to refer to them simply as anstralopithecines."
6323,最早的南方古猿化石可以追溯到420万年前，如果不是追溯到560万年前到580万年前的话，而最近的南方古猿化石仅100万年。,"The earliest australopithecine fossils date back as many as 4.2 million, if not 5.6 million to 5.8 million, years ago,  whereas the most recent ones are only about 1 million years old."
6323,从埃塞俄比亚到南部的非洲东部各处，以及向西进入乍得，人们已找到它们的踪迹（参见图3.5）。,They have been found along the length of eastern Africa from Ethiopia to South Africa and westward into Chad (Figure 3.5).
6324,这并非独一无二的事件。,This was not an isolated instance.
6324,像这样的“货物崇拜”——以及其他很多运动，它们预示死者复活、白人毁灭或沦为奴隶，还有乌托邦似的富庶日子的到来——自从20世纪初以来就一直在美拉尼西亚零星出现。,"Such a ""cargo cults"" 一 and many other movements promising the resurrection of the dead, the destruction or enslavement of Europeans, and the coming of utopian riches—have sporadically appeared throughout Melanesia ever since the beginning of this century."
6324,既然这些信徒在时间和空间上都很分散，各自独立，那么他们之间的相似性就很明显是社会条件相似的结果。,"Since these cults are widely separated in space and time, their similarities are apparently the result of similarities in social conditions."
6324,在这些地区，原住民族的传统文化已经被连根拔起了。,In these areas the traditional cultures of the indigenous peoples have been uprooted.
6324,欧洲人，或者受到欧洲人影响的本地人，掌握着所有的政治和经济权力的本地人被雇用去卸载和分发西方制造的商品。但却没有关于如何获得这些商品的任何实际知识。,"Europeans, or European-influenced natives, hold all political and economic power.Natives are employed unloading and dis¬tributing Western-made goods hut have no practical knowledge of how to attain these goods."
6324,由于冷酷的现实不能为文化衰落和经济剥夺的日常挫败提供任何希望，此时，宗教便提供了解决办法。,"When cold reality offers no hope from the daily frustrations of cultural deterioration and economic deprivation, religion offers the solution."
6325,在没有中央集权政府的社会中，政治系统更多地被看成是被密切编织到社会存在的其他方面中的东西。,"In societies with no centralised state, the political system may rather be seen as something intimately woven into other aspects of existence."
6325,非常常见，在无政府社会中，亲属制度和宗教实际上与政治是无法区分的。,"Very often, in stateless societies, kinship and religion are in practice indistinguishable from politics."
6325,作为现代社会的特征的那种制度上的差异在许多其他社会中是缺乏的（例子见 Godelier 1975），这意味着期待找到可识别的例如国会那样的政治机构往往是没有结果的。,"That institutional differentiation which is characteristic of modern societies is absent in many others (see for instance Godelier 1975).This implies that it would often be fruitless to look for identifiable political institutions which could be compared with, say, parliaments."
6325,所以，政治人类学家不得不寻找政治决策的形成机制——他们必须找出重要的决定是在什么地方和如何做出的、谁受到这些决定的影响、什么规则和规范控制了政治行动、霸权如何受到挑战，以及社会的统治者会安排哪些可能的制裁。,"Instead, political anthropologists have to look for the political decision-making mechanisms – they must find out where and how the important decisions are being made, who is affected by the decisions, which rules and norms govern political action, how hegemony is challenged, and which possible sanctions the rulers of society dispose of."
6326,再分配意味着核心行动者（例如酋长或国家行政机关)从社会成员那里收到了商品，而他有义务再次把这些商品分配给他们。,"Redistribution means that a central actor (such as a chief or a state administration) receives goods from the members of society, which he commits himself to redistribute to them."
6326,这种体系加强和巩固了统治者的合法性，同时也为贫困者创造了一个社会安全网。,"This kind of system confirms and strengthens the legitimacy of the ruler, as well as creating a social safety net for the needy."
6326,再分配因而是集权化的，并且能够被描述为是等级化的分配原则，而互惠是去集权化和平等主义的分配原则。,"Redistribution is thus centralised and can be described as a hierarchical principle of distribution, whereas reciprocity is a decentralised, egalitarian principle of distribution."
6326,第三种分配形式是市场交换，以交换者之间的契约关系为基础。,"The third form of distribution is the market principle, which is based on a contractual relationship between the exchangers."
6326,市场是匿名的，包含了契约自由的抽象规则（也就是，你可以自由地选择交易伙伴）。,"The market is anonymous and involves abstract rules about contractual liberty (that is, one can choose one's trading partners)."
6326,它一般会创造一种互动的非个人形式。,It normally creates an impersonal form of interaction.
6326,虽然市场原则主导了现代资本主义社会、再分配原则主导了封建社会，而互惠原则主导了平等主义的小型社会，在波拉尼的分析框架中，一种分配形式并不排除其他分配形式。,"Although the market principle dominates in modern capitalist societies, redistribution in feudal societies and reciprocity in egalitarian small-scale societies, in Polanyi's scheme one form of distribution does not exclude the others."
6327,A.瓦伊达（Vayda，A.,"Vayda, A. (Ed.)."
6327,，1969）编：《环境与文化行为：文化人类学中的生态研究》（Environment and cultural behavior： Ecological studies in cultural anthropology），纽约州加登城：自然史出版社。,"(1969).Environment and cultural behavior: Ecological studies in cultural anthropology.Garden City, NY: Natural History Press."
6327,本书所收集的研究关注的焦点是文化行为和环境现象之间的相互关系。,The focus of the studies collected here is the interrelationship between cultural behavior and environmental phenomena.
6327,作者们试图通过把文化行为与文化行为所由产生的物质世界联系起来而使其易于理解。,The writers attempt to make cultural behavior intelligible by relating it to the material world it develops in.
6327,本书的文章涵盖了人口、占卜、仪式、战争、食物生产、气候和疾病等主题。,"This volume includes articles concerning population, divination, ritual, warfare, food production; climate, and diseases."
6328,在大多数时候，他们至少有好几个家庭共同生活在一起，其中一个家庭的成员在所有其他的家庭中都有亲戚这样，家庭之间在日常生活方面相互合作，共享食物和其他资源，照管彼此的小孩，有时甚至还一起吃饭。,"Thus families cooperate with one another on a daily basis, sharing food and other resources, looking out for the children, and sometimes even eating together."
6328,"伊努伊特人对多家庭群体的共同福利和对彼此的子女的连带责任感,与美国基本上“完全靠自己”的家庭形成了鲜明对出。","The sense of shared responsibility for one another children and for the general welfare in Inuit multifamily groups contrasts with families in the United States, which are basically ""on their own."""
6328,在美国，政府賦予家庭的唯一责任是照顾孩子以及保证家庭成员的福利，在这一点上，家庭很少得到來自家庭以外的帮助。,"Here the state has assigned sole responsibility to the family for child care and the welfare of family members, with relatively little assistance from outside."
6328,当然，美国家庭之间也会而且也经常相互帮助，但是他们并没有义务要这样做。,"To be sure, families can and often do help one another out, but they are under no obligation to do so."
6329,真实性的观念，带着所有原始的包袱，修正了一个被普遍接受的常识，这常识认为，只有那些非常纯粹的文化才是值得人类学关注的。,"The notion of authenticity, with all its primitivist baggage, prevailed to such an extent that the received wisdom was that only the culturally very ‘pure’ were worthy of anthropological attention."
6329,如果一个人穿西方的衣服，能够讲西方的语言，或者为西方老板工作，那么他或她就已经不再是真正的土著了。,"If a person wore Western clothes, could speak a Western language, or worked for Western masters than he or she could not be an authentic ‘native’."
6329,我们只能研究真正的雅诺马马人、丁卡人或哈根，而不能研究瓜希波人（Guahibo）、阿赞地人、盖丘亚人中已经变成“城镇人”或受雇于工薪劳动的人。,"We could study only realYanomami, Dinka, or Hagen, and not any Guahibo, Ashanti, or Quechua who had become ‘townies’ or engaged in wage labour."
6329,即使到了20世纪80年代，对于一个亚马逊印第安人来说，承认在上述不可靠的人中工作——不单陈述了这类研究的价值，而且说明了与我们的“真实性”观念无关——仍旧是件十分勇敢的事（Gow 1991）。,It was a courageous step even as late as the 1980s for an Amazonianist to admit to working among such inauthentic people—and to state not only the worth of such a study but also the irrelevance of our notion of ‘authenticity’ (see Gow 1991).
6330,我们通常在畜牧游牧、集约农亚和工业社会中看到这一模式，在送些社会中，男子的工作使他们大部分时间在家外。,"This pattern is frequently seen in pastoral nomadic, intensive agricultural, and industrial societies, where men's work keeps them outside the home for much of the time."
6330,因此，男孩和女孩最初都由妇女抚育，在她们的照顾下，她们鼓励顺从。,"Thus, boys and girls alike are raised primarily by women, who encourage compliance in their charges."
6330,然而在某一时刻，男孩必须经历角色倒转，变得像男子汉那样，他应当强硬，富有进攻性和竞争性。,"At some point, however, boys must undergo a role reversal to become like men, who are supposed to be tough, aggressive, and competitive."
6330,要做到这一点，他们必须证明其男性气质，女人则不要以此种方式证明其女性身份。,To do this they must prove their masculinity in ways women do not to prove their feminine identity.
6330,—般来说，这包含着一些主张：男性比妇女优越，因而对女性有权威。,"Commonly, this involves assertions of male superiority, and hence authority, over women."
6330,"从历史上看，根据性别分工的社会,经常强行抑制那些以相协调为特点的角色，使后者的平等性质失效。","Historically, sexually segregated societies often have imposed their control on societies featuring sexual integration, upsetting the egalitarian nature of the latter."
6331,再次总结一下：人类学教给我们几个教训，它们看起来有些自相矛盾，实际上却是相互关联的。,"To sum up, again: Anthropology teaches several lessons, which may seem contradictory but in fact are interrelated."
6331,第一个教训是整体论，即我们应该尽可能去看到整体。,"The first lesson is holism, that we should try to view wholes."
6331,第二个教训是，尽可能地尝试，我们不可能成功地掌握整体，因此我们必须区别分类。,"The second is that, try as we might, we cannot succeed in grasping the whole, hence we must distinguish categories."
6331,第三个教训是，我们必须警惕并反对将任何分类具体化为一样事物；我们必须总是记得，它只是来自整体的一个抽象。,The third is that we must guard against concretizing any category into a thing; we must always remember that it is simply an abstraction from the whole.
6332,在这一背景之下，人类学对我们看待未来的贡献就显而易史了。,"Against this background, anthropology's contribution to our view of the future is clear."
6332,由于人类学家所持的是全面的视角，所以他们擅长于看到各个部分如何相互配合构成较大的整体。,"With their holistic perspective, anthropologists are specialists at seeing how parts fit together into a larger whole."
6332,由于他们所持的是长期的历史的视角，所以他们能够把短期的趋势放在比较长期的视野之下来看待。,"With their evolutionary perspective, they can see short-term trends in longer term perspective."
6332,由于拥有100多年跨文化研究的历史，所以人类学家能够识别他们遇到的受文化束缚的主张；最后，他们还熟悉应付各种各样问题的各种供选择的方法。,"With more than 100 years of cross-cultural research behind them, anthropologists can recognize culture-bound assertions when they encounter them; and, finally, they are familiar with alternative ways to deal with a wide variety of problems."
6333,最初作为科学的宣传武器而被征召的价值话语，坚持理论与基础研究是实践与技术革新之源泉的谎言，最终变成了证明工作之正当性的意识形态手段，并且，关于价值的所有述说都同对象以及与对象相关的表现——工作的现实虚构——不可分地联结在了一起。,"Enlisted first as the propaganda arm of science, asserting the lie of theory and basic research as the source of practice and technological innovation, the discourse of value eventually became the ideological means for the justification of work, and all talk of value was linked inseparably to objects and to performance relative to objects—the reality fictions of work."
6333,最初将自己表现为实践性现实的语境——科学游戏的美学可以在其中发现意义和正当性——的东西，变成了官僚的非现实通过伪装成为理性的权力运作而为现实确定界限的条件，一切话语都沦为了工作的修辞。,What had originally presented itself as the context of practical reality within which the aesthetics of the play of science would find its meaning and justification became the condition of a bureaucratic unreality establishing the limits of reality through the exercise of power disguised as reason.All discourse was reduced to the rhetoric of work.
6333,但是，在这个它全权控制的胜利时刻，我们是否感觉到了无法控制的东西爆发的第一丝惊恐？,"But, at this moment of its triumph of total control, do we sense the first tremors of the eruption of the uncontrollable?"
6334,在这种精神的光照之下，让我回到眼下的这本书。,"In this spirit, let me turn to the present volume."
6334,每个人都能够想出那些本该被涵括的个人或视角。,Everyone will be able to think of individuals or perspectives that should have been included.
6334,本书的焦点限制了它，这种限制的途径只有从一开始才能通过作者和编者得以明晰。,The volume's focus limits it in ways its authors and editors can only begin to make apparent.
6334,读者可能会注意到，它对人类学的偏见使它忽略了照片、电影、表演理论、纪录片艺木、非虚构小说、“新新闻写作”、口述史以及各种形式的社会学。,"Readers may note that its anthropological bias neglects photography, film, performance theory, documentary art, the nonfiction novel, ""the new journalism,"" oral history, and various forms of sociology."
6334,本书对从非西方经验和女性主义理论与政治中兴起的新的民族志的可能性相对关注较少。,The book gives relatively little attention to new ethnographic possibilities emerging from non-Western experience and from feminist theory and politics.
6334,让我再详细说说被排除的这最后一条，因为它关系到产生这些文章的大学环境所具有的知识和道德方面的强大影响。,"Let me dwell on this last exclusion, for it concerns an especially strong intellectual and moral influence in the university milieux from which these essays have sprung."
6335,这本著作的创新之处在于它结合了对社会整合的结构功能主义的分析和对信仰系统和宇宙论的解释性说明，显示了社会结构和文化之间的相互关系而没有将一方简化为另一方。,"The book was innovative in that it united a largely structural-functionalist analysis of social integration with an interpretive account of the belief system and cosmology, showing the interrelationship between social structure and culture without reducing one to the other."
6335,他接下来的一项主要研究是《努尔人》（The Nuer，1940），也同样重要，主要影响力在于其关于无政府民族的政治一体化的理论，尽管对他的家系模型最终有越来越多的批判。,"His next major study, The Nuer (1940), was no less important, and exerted a major influence on theories of political integration among stateless peoples, although criticism of his lineage model eventually grew."
6335,作为一位从1946年起就在牛津大学任教的教授，埃文思-普里查德调和了人类学中有分歧的一些传统，将莫斯和利维-布留尔介绍进了以英语为母语的环境（虽然他对列维-斯特劳斯没有印象）。,"As a professor in Oxford from 1946, Evans-Pritchard mediated between divergent traditions in anthropology, introducing Mauss and Lévy-Bruhl to the Anglophone milieu (although he was unimpressed by Lévi-Strauss)."
6335,在1950年的一场重要演讲中（“人类学和历史学”，出版于1962年），他正式宣布了与拉德克利夫-布朗关于人类学是一种自然科学的观点的决裂，并认为人类学自身应该被视为一门人文学科。,"At an important lecture in 1950 (""Anthropology and History"", published in Evans-Pritchard 1962), he formally announced a break with RadcliffeBrown's view of anthropology as a kind of natural science, and argued that it should instead view itself as one of the humanities."
6336,几个月来，我带着这些相抵触的事实开展工作，总意识到马林诺斯基的影子、他的话、他的解释。,"For many months I worked with these discordant realities, always conscious of Malinowskis shadow, his words, his explanations."
6336,虽然我在一些重要领域发现相当大的各种差异，但是我逐渐明白他是如何得出结论的。,"Although I found significant differences in areas of importance, I gradually came to understand how he reached certain conclusions."
6336,我们俩从知情者那里得到的回答并不那么不同，而且我实际上可能追溯马林诺斯基怎样以讲得通的和有科学意义的方式分析他的知情者告诉他的东西——考虑到人类学家当时一般对这类社会的认识。,The answers we both received from informants were not so dissimilar; and I could actually trace how Malinowski had analyzed what his informants told him in a way that made sense and was scientifically significant一given what anthropologists generally then recognized about such societies.
6336,"我们的田野工作相隔60年,而且我的研究的任何比较与其说表明了马林诺斯基的错误解释，还不如说表明了人类学知识的发展以及他那个时代到我这一时代的研究进展。","Sixty years separate our fieldwork, and any comparison of our stud- ies illustrates not so much Malinowski's mistaken interpretations but the developments in anthropological knowledge and inquiry from hts time to mine."
6337,埃文思-普里査德曾经写道，他相信他对阿赞德巫术的研究可能有助于理解俄国的共产主义（Evans-Pritchard 1951）。,Evans-Pritchard once wrote that he believed his studies of Azande witchcraft might contribute to the understanding of communist Russia (EvansPritchard 1951).
6337,他的意思是，理解一个社会的知识体系的意识形态基础可以对其他地方的类似结构提供线索。,What he meant was that an understanding of the ideological underpinnings of the knowledge system of one society may give clues as to similar structures elsewhere.
6337,毫无疑问，知识体系创造了世界的一种特定秩序，而这并不仅仅涉及我们在其他章节讨论到的性别意识形态、种姓意识形态、阶级或族群性意识形态，而且也包括了经验的特定构成过程。,"Undoubtedly, knowledge systems create a particular order in the world, and this does not only concern ideologies of gender, caste, class or ethnicity as dealt with in other chapters here, but also the very structuring of experience."
6337,乔治·奥威尔（George Orwell 1984[1949]） 在他著名的小说《1984》中描述了一个社会，那里的语言有意识地被权力精英改变了，目的是防止市民进行批判的思考。,"In his celebrated novel 1984, George Orwell (1984 [1949]) describes a society where the language has consciously been changed by the power elite, in order to prevent the citizens from critical thought."
6337,因此，在“新语言”中，“自由（freedom）”这个词语失去了它的“个体自由” 的含义，而只能用在比如“狗的身上没有虱子”（the dog is free from lice）这样的句子中。,"In ""Newspeak"", the word ""freedom"" has thus lost its meaning of ""individual freedom"" and can only be used in sentences like ""the dog is free from lice""."
6338,卡特林和歌德所描述的虽然是一个单一的表演，但是尽管用了直示的和其他种种周详的措辞，他们仍然是以一种概括化的方式完成了描述。,"Catlin and Goethe describe a single performance, but, despite deictic and other particularizing locutions, they do it in a generalizing way."
6338,格尔茨显然参观过许多场斗鸡，却从没有描述过某一场具体的赛事。,"Geertz, who apparently attended many cockfights, never describes a specific cockfight."
6338,他建构了巴厘斗鸡，然后把他的建构阐释为：“巴厘斗鸡”。,"He constructs the Balinese cockfight and interprets his construction: ""the Balinese cockfight."""
6338,他关于进入的传统的故事起到了一个直示的作用，这与卡特林的被指派好的位置或者歌德的诸多“这里”和“现在”相比并没有多大差别。,"His conventional tale of entry serves a deictic function not that different from Catlin's assigned place or Goethe's ""here's"" and ""now's."""
6338,在没有具体的时间或空间的优势地位的情况下，这故事却造就了一个具体翔实的幻象，它证明了民族志作者曾到过那里，并把源自那在场的所有权威都陚予了他。,It gives the illusion of specificity when there is no specific temporal or spatial vantage point.It attests to the ethnographer's having been there and gives him whatever authority arises from that presence.
6339,在非洲，殖民主义假想了作为一个族性基点的部落发展的客观先决条件。,Colonialism in Africa thus provided the objective requirements for the development of tribes as primary foci of identity.
6339,但我不认为族性只有在殖民主义条件下才能发展。,But I don't maintain that ethnicity could develop only under colonialism.
6339,在不平等交换关系存在的前提下，加上知识阶层提出文化命题和天命等级理念，族性是可能出现的。,It is possible for it to emerge wherever there are relations of inequality and exchange accompanied by intellectual assumptions of cultural and somatic classification.
6340,通过在无产阶级中使用民族志的助产术，威利斯揭示出，在他们当中，而不是在知识分子当中，具现着对资本主义最有力的批判；而这在马克思主义理论中是由，也应该是由他们的战略地位所赋予的。,"By his ethnographic midwifery among the proletariat, Willis reveals that they, and not the intellectuals, embody the most powerful critique of capitalism, and this is as it should be, given their strategic position in Marxist theory."
6340,威利斯的民族志试图要解决马克思主义中长期存在的一个尴尬的局面，即需要有激进的中产阶级知识分子（或者是工人阶级出生的知识分子）来作为工人阶级群体意识的代言人。,Willis's ethnography thus proposes to resolve the long standing embarrassment in Marxism of the need for radical middle class intellectuals (or intellectuals of working class origin) to be the articulate consciousness of working class masses.
6340,威利斯希望能展示，工人阶级能平等和有力地陈述自己的意见 （但对于如何在文本方面实现这一断言的解释学问题，他还缺乏足够的自我批判，下面将讨论到这一问题）。,"Willis presumes to show that they can speak equally and effectively for themselves (but without his being self-critical enough about the hermeneutic problems of realizing this claim textually, discussed below)."
6341,马克思主义人类学中还有一个共同点是对中心 ( centre )  与外围( periphery )  的区分。,Yet another distinction common in Marxist anthropology is that between centre and periphery.
6341,在某种意义上，中心指权力实施的地方，比如殖民资本或国家资本。,"The centre, in this sense, is the place where power is exercised, such as the colonial or national capital."
6341,外围指受到中心决策影响的地方之一，比如为中心地区提供再分配产品，或同中心地区进行贸易的乡村地区。,"The periphery is one of the places affected by decisions made at the centre, such as a rural area where peasants produce for redistribution or trade from the centre."
6342,三种高级种姓的成员被认为是“出生两次的（twice-born）”，因为他们参加过一个使精神再生的典礼。,"Members of the three highest varnas are called ""twice-born"" because they have gone through a ceremony entailing spiritual rebirth."
6342,对种姓制度进行这样的描述，尽管并非是不正确的，却过于简单化并最终可能引起误解。,"Such a description of the caste system, although it is not incorrect, is simplistic and ultimately misleading."
6342,首先，必须注意到，也有一些非印度教信徒被包括在种姓制度之内：印度大约有1.3亿穆斯林有他们自己的种姓（通常是低级的），还有许多异教徒的群体被认为是“部落的”常常被归类为贱民。,"First, it should be noted that there are also non-Hindus who belong to castes; India's approximately 130 million Muslims have their own castes (usually low ones), and the many ethnic groups sometimes called ""tribals"" tend to be classified and treated as Untouchables."
6342,其中一些人，部分地正是出于这个原因，已经转向基督教或佛教。,"Some of them, partly for this very reason, have converted to Christianity or Buddhism."
6343,移民群体中的种族复兴可以从这个视角加以理解，利用乡愁和一种疏离感，这些复兴行动设法重新灌输一种对过去的延续感、本体论的安全感（Giddens 1990）和个体的安全感。,"Ethnic revitalisation among migrant groups may be understood within this perspective.Drawing on nostalgia and a sense of alienation, such movements contrive to re-instil a sense of continuity with the past, ontological security (Giddens 1990) and personal security."
6343,虽然已经获得人类学家和社会学家的重视，复兴只体现了硬币的一面。,"Although it has received intense attention from anthropologists and sociologists, revitalisation represents only one side of the coin."
6343,很清楚，那些有时激发了复兴的进程，却也会导致相反的结果（也就是不确定、双重人格和个体主义），值得注意。,"Clearly, the processes which sometimes inspire revitalisation, but which may also lead to the opposite (namely uncertainty, ambivalence and individualism), merit attention."
6343,这些过程是全球化的进程，由此，人们为有时规模惊人的社会和文化网络的变化所裹挟；根据齐格蒙特·鲍曼（Zygmunt Bauman）的观点，也因为这种全球化的进程，社会“宣布所有对自由的限制均为非法，同时消灭社会的确定性而使种族的不确定性合法化”（Bauman 1992，p.XXIV）。,"These are the processes of globalisation, whereby people become embedded in shifting social and cultural networks of sometimes staggering scale, where society, in Zygmunt Bauma's view, ""proclaims all restrictions on freedom illegal, at the same time doing away with social certainty and legalizing ethical uncertainty"" (1992, p. xxiv)."
6344,在美国，这一研究的动力来自许多方面。,
6344,,The impetus for work in the United States came from a number of sources.
6344,1920年代，一些美国机构开始着手解决与种族关系有关的问题。,In the 1920s some American foundations were beginning to address problems of race relations.
6344,弗兰兹·博厄斯的学生梅尔维尔·赫斯柯维茨受资助对美国黑人生活的“种族混合”（race crossing）及其他方面进行了研究（Herskovits 1928）。,"Franz Boas's student Melville Herskovits was funded to study ""race crossing"" and other aspects of the lives of blacks in the United States (1928)."
6345,发生在最近历史上的最广为人知的种族灭绝，是德国纳粹在种族优越的名义下杀害欧洲犹太人和吉普赛人的事件。,The most widely known act of genocide in recent history was the Nazi German attempt to wipe out European Jews and gypsies in the name of racial superiority.
6345,不幸的是，把这一事件称为“大屠杀”的寻常做法——似乎这件事是独一无二的，或至少是例外的——往往使我们看不见这样一个事实:这一无比恐怖的事件只是再常见不过的现象的又一实例罢了。,"Unfortunately, the common practice of referring to this as ""holocaust""-as if it were something unique or at least exceptional-tends to blind us to the fact this thoroughly monstrous act is simply one more example of an all too common phenomenon."
6345,从1945年到1987年，至少有680万人（也许多达1630万）死于国内的种族灭绝，而与之相比，从1945年到10年，死于国家之间战争的人数只有334万。,"From 1945 to 1987, a minimum of 68 million, but perhaps as many as 16.3 million, people were victims of internal (within state) genocide, as compared to the 334 million people who have died in wars between different countries from 1945 to 1980."
6346,对种族偏见和种族冲突的心理学解释之所以会使人误解和缺乏根据，是因为这类问题属于社会和文化领域，而不是心理学领域。,Psychological interpretations of race prejudice and inter-racial antagonisms are misleading and unsound because these problems are sociological and cultural rather than psychological.
6346,正如我们己经指出的，对与某种制度相关的主观心理经验的描述，并构成对这种制度的说明。,"As we have pointed out, a description of subjective psychological experience correlated with an institution does not constitute an explanation of the institution."
6346,自我经验只是制度的功能，而不是制度的起因。,"The experience of the ego is a function of the institution, not its cause."
6346,对于制度只能从文化上予以解释。,"And, the institution must be explained culturologically."
6347,由于对塞尔维亚少数民族进行了彻底的种族清洗，克罗地亚现在基本上就是一个族裔方面同质的民族-国家。,"Thanks to its efficient ethnic cleansing of its Serbian ethnic minority,Croatia is now very nearly an ethnically homogenous nationstate."
6347,在这种情况下，在构成民族自豪感诸多的要素中，族裔要素注定压倒公民要素。,"In these conditions, the ethnic is bound to dominate the civic in the components of national pride."
6347,事实上，对少数民族的清除会削弱克罗地亚民族的公民要素，其民主可能处于危险之中。,"Indeed, the removal of its ethnic minority may so weaken the civic components of Croatian identity that its democracy may be in danger."
6347,一个进行种族清洗以获得自由的国家并不是真正民主国家，而只是由多数派独裁的国家，这并不意外。,It is not accidental that a nation which engages in ethnic cleansing in order to make itself free ends up not as a true democracy but as a plebiscitary dictatorship.
6348,有一个“会议野人”或“流浪委员会之熊”，他从来不换洗衣服，参加听有的会议，跟白种女人睡觉，作为一种“脏熊种族主义实验”。,"There is the ""conference savage,"" or ""nomadic committee bear, ""who never washes or changes his clothes, goes to all the conferences, and sleeps with white women as a kind of ""foul bear racism test."""
6348,还有一个跛子的故事，他卖他的木腿换酒喝（木腿上有一个标签好让人寄回来）。对此，白人的道德是“停止喝酒”，而印第安部落的道徳是用一条木腿换免费的酒喝。,"And there is the story of the cripple who sells his wooden leg for a drink (the leg has a label on it to be mailed back), for which the white moral is ""stop drinking,"" but the tribal moral is to find free booze with a wooden leg."
6348,无疑还有“滑流上的卡斯特”，一个印第安人事务局的雇员和卡斯特的转世，他苦于自己在印第安人手中受羞辱的噩梦，因而把所有的时间都消磨在他的软垫椅上。,"No wonder there is thus also ""Custer on the Slipstream,"" a Bureau of Indian Affairs employee and rein carnation of Custer, who suffers his own nightmares of humiliation at the hands of the Indians, and so spends all his time in his padded chair."
6349,从某些方面来说，当代递过记忆重新创造族群身份之举绝不是什么新鲜事。,"In some ways, the contemporary reinvention of ethnic identity through remembering is nothing new."
6349,毕达哥拉斯的记忆概念（让柏拉图很是着迷）也把世界想象为一个遗忘的世界，现实隐藏在它的表面之下。,"The Pythagorean notion of memory (which fascinated Plato) also conceived of the world as one of oblivion, of superficial appearances behind which lay the hidden realities."
6349,只有那参与记忆的活动，会回忆，在奔向另一个世界的时候保存这一世界的知识，从天界返回这一世界的时候避开遗忘之河的水的灵魂，才能逃脱再生的循环、起起落落的无意义重复，和将人类简化为机械或野兽之符号的墒。,"Only the soul that engaged in memory exercises, in recollections, in preserving the knowledge of this world when proceeding to the next and avoiding the waters of Lethe (or Ameles) when returning to this world from the celestial realms would be able to escape the cycles of rebirth, the flux of meaningless repetitions, and the entropy toward reductions of human beings into mechanical or bestial ciphers."
6349,只有通过记忆，为经常的训练和努力所打磨的记忆，一个人才能洗清过去生活的罪，净化灵魂，从遗忘的重复之渊上升和逃脱。,"Only through memory, honed by constant exercise and effort, could one purge the sins of past lives, purify the soul, ascend and escape from oblivious repetitions."
6350,这类观点似乎要么夸大要么轻描淡写个体经验的独特性、主体的复杂性以及形式和意义之间的关系所具有的那种丰富的微妙之处。,"What the above line of argument appears to overlook or underplay is the uniqueness of individual experience, the complexities of subjectivity and the rich subtleties of the relationship between form and meaning."
6350,从这一角度出发，无论存在多少所谓惯常的、悠久的叙事形式，个体在运用它们时，将不容分辨地发现他们自己在认知上与这些形式有所不同。,"On this view, whatever the seeming habituality and longevity of narrative forms, the individuals partaking of them (animating them by their mental and bodily, verbal and behavioural presence) willy-nilly find themselves cognitively apart from those forms as such."
6350,也就是说，在惯常的叙事形式、文化模式、组织方式、叙述方式、阐释以及评价方式中，不可避免地会引发意义的个体性。,"That is, within the conventional forms of narrative, its cultural patterns of framing, organization, recitation, interpretation and evaluation, an individuality of meaning is an inevitable product."
6351,一个普遍的假定是，主位观察是错误的，而客位观察是正确的。,"It is a common assumption that emic perspectives are wrong, whereas the etic perspectives are correct."
6351,这是一种令人遗憾的建构问题的方式。,This is an unfortunate way of framing the issue.
6351,问题不在于正确的是“本地人”还是“科学家”，而在于社会科学家有其专业的兴趣，而他们追求的那种洞察力常常与田野点本地人的兴趣是不一致的。,"The point is not whether the ""natives"" or the ""scientists"" are correct, but rather that social scientists have specialised interests and that the kinds of insight they aim at are frequently not identical with the interests of their hosts in the field."
6351,有很多种同样正确的方式去描述一种社会和文化的系统：你的兴趣决定你的选择。,There are a number of equally correct ways of describing a cultural and social system; one's choice must depend on one's interests.
6351,一个关于主位-客位的区别的更深误解是，主位的观念是“具体的”而客位的观念是“抽象的”。,"A further misunderstanding regarding the emic–etic distinction amounts to the idea that emic notions are ""concrete"" whereas etic notions are ""abstract""."
6351,这也许是事实，但并非天生正确。,"This may be the case, but it is not inherently true."
6352,多数民族-少数民族关系的大多数经验性案例都出现了种族隔离、同化和整合。,"Most empirical cases of majority–minority relationships display a combination of segregation, assimilation and integration."
6352,同化很可能发生在个体层面上，即使主要的趋势可能是种族隔离或种族合并。,"Assimilation may well take place at an individual level, even if the chief tendency might be segregation or ethnic incorporation."
6352,尽管斯堪的纳维亚北部的萨米人在最近几十年向着更强烈的种族合并和有选择的种族隔离的趋势发展，仍然有一些个体被一种多数民族的种族身份所同化（如挪威人、芬兰人或瑞典人）。,"Despite the fact that the Sami of northern Scandinavia have in recent decades moved towards a stronger ethnic incorporation and chosen segregation, there are still individuals who are assimilated to a majority ethnic identity (Norwegian, Finnish or Swedish, as the case may be)."
6353,但“无产阶级专政”是一种错觉，它也宣称“人民”的统治，但并非全体人民，而仅仅是一个特殊阶级、即“挑选出的人民”的统治。,"But a ""dictatorship of the proletariat"" is a delusion.It, too, declares that ""the people"" rule; not all the people, but only a particular class —a ""chosen people."""
6353,近年来社会进化的过程已经表明这个口号是多么不现实。,The course of social evolution in recent years has shown how unrealistic this slogan is.
6353,“无产阶级专政”在逻辑上与社会学上都是矛盾的术语。,"""The dictatorship of the proletariat"" is both a logical and a sociological contradiction of terms."
6354,作为从我们的灵长目动物祖先那里遗传来的东西，我们的姿势一呼叫系统的许多声音和姿势，与语言相比，在更大程度上取决于遗传规定。,"As features we have inherited from our primate ancestors, many sounds and gestures of our gesture-call system are subject to greater genetic determination than language."
6354,"这就解释了各种各样的哭泣和面部表情具有普遍性的原因，也说明了人们用姿势一呼叫来虚张声势,或者——尤其是——说谎具有极大困难的原因。","This accounts for the universality of various cries and facial expressions, as well as for the great difficulty people have bluffing or especially lying through gesture-calls."
6354,这不是说，该系统完全不受控制，因为它不是那样的；这只是说，与口语相比，它不太易于控制。,"This does not mean the system is entirely immune to deliberate control, for it is not; it is merely less subject to control than spoken language."
6355,在其他的一些情况中，唯物主义被认为是文化现代化的不可缺少的一个部分——无论是基于公众公共体制的、标准化书本教育的动态社会还是公众阅读的兴起。对于前者，厄内斯特·盖尔纳认为书本教育是至关重要的，而针对后者，本尼迪克特·安德森（Benedict Anderson）强调“印刷资本主义”技术的普及孕育了公众阅读的兴起。,"In other cases, materialism is conceived as part and parcel of cultural processes of modernisation – be it the mobile society based on a public system of mass, standardised literary education which Ernest Gellner regards as critical, or the rise of reading publics engendered by the spread of the technology of ""printcapitalism"" stressed by Benedict Anderson."
6355,在所有这些情况下，不管民族和民族主义的结果会如何让人感到遗憾。二者或多或少被认为是现代工业社会不可避免的产物，,"In all these cases, nations and nationalisms are viewed as more or less inevitable outgrowths of a modern, industrial society, however regrettable their consequences may be."
6356,出于某种原因，所有这一切让我联想到一个在脱衣舞夜总会外厮混的少年，为了把他移交给警察，先将其逮进再将其逐出——这将给他以教训。,"For some reason, it all made me think of a teenager hanging around outside a strip joint who gets dragged inside in order to be turned over to the police and kicked out again—that'll teach him."
6356,“规训”因此经常被执。如果在脱衣舞夜总会未必如此，但在学术界必定如此。,"So ""disciplining"" is often done, if not at strip joints, then certainly in academies."
6356,多内尔所做的明显是写了一本令人恼怒和模棱两可的书，它是否“真实”？是否属于民族志？是否可归为自传？是否宣称了它在专业或学术上的权或？,"What Donner clearly did was write an infuriatingly ambiguous book, which may or may not be ""true,"" is and is not ethnography, is and is not autobiography, does and does not claim professional and academic authority, is and is not based on fieldwork, and so on."
6356,是否基于田野工作？,
6356,等等这类问题都没有定论。,
6357,遵守科学修辞之教规的迫切愿望，使得博物学式的简单的现实主义成为了民族志散文中占据支配地位的模式，但那已是一种虚幻的现实主义。一方而，这一现实主义宣扬“描写”诸如“文化”或“社会”这样的非实体的谬论，就好像它们完全是可以被观察的，尽管它不太优雅、有些缺陷；另一方而，同样可笑的行为主义者主张“措写”与话语——被行动者用来构或并定位其行动——相隔绝的行动的重复模式。他们都在天真地保证，观察者的基本话语本身是一个足以完成描写行动任务客观形式。,"The urge to conform to the canons of scientific rhetorich as made the easy realism of natural history the dominant mode of ethnographic prose, but it has been anillusory realism, promoting, on the one hand, the absurdity of ""describing"" nonentities such as ""culture"" or ""society"" as if they were fully observable, though somewhat ungainly, bugs, and, on the other, the equally ridiculous behaviorist pretense of ""describing"" repetitive patterns of action in isolation from the discourse that actors use in constituting and situating their action, and all in simpleminded surety that the observers' grounding discourse is itself an objective form sufficient to the task of describing acts."
6358,就其他方面而言，对非洲宗教的学术处理显然受到了限制性认同的殖民主义假想的影响。,"As with everything else, scholarly treatments of African religion have been influenced by the colonial assumption of bounded identity."
6358,非洲宗教被认为是微观的，处理面对面关系，并最多延伸至单一“部落”。,"African religion has been regarded as microcosmic, dealing with face-to-face relations, and extending at most to a single ""tribe""."
6358,事实上，非洲宗教表达了各个层面上的认同，从家庭到朝拜区域。,"In fact, African religion expressed identities at every level from the household to the cult region."
6359,也有一些其他类型的冲突存在于以合作团体的面貌出现的不同族群之间，比如，土著民族和移民群体向优势群体要求文化生存的权利和大多数人平等的权利，通常没有要求建立自己的国家。,"There are also other kinds of conflicts where ethnic groups emerge as corporate groups.Indigenous peoples and immigrant groups may, for example, demand the right to cultural survival and the right to equality with the majority, usually without demanding their own state."
6359,还有一些其他的种族冲突无法通过制度化的政治表达。,Other ethnic conflicts are not expressed through institutional politics.
6359,德国的本地人和移民之间的冲突，或者美国的黑人和白人之间的冲突，通常在日常情境中上演。,"Clashes between natives and immigrants in Germany, or between blacks and whites in the USA, are usually enacted in day-to-day situations."
6359,也就是说，复杂社会中的族群划分可以表现在许多不同的层次上。,"In other words, ethnicity may be articulated at many levels in complex societies."
6359,族群划分并不必然具有冲突的含义：它可以用非常平淡无奇的方式来表达——通过日常情境定义、通过印象管理、用宗教崇拜和其他和平的现象。,"Ethnicity does not necessarily entail conflict: it may be expressed in quite undramatic ways through everyday definitions of situations, through impression management, in religious cults and other peaceful phenomena."
6359,它可以在不同的规模水平上被鉴别出来——从双重互动到内战。,It can be identified at different levels of scale – from dyadic interaction to civil war.
6359,换句话说，族群性的现象是一个复杂的现象。,"The phenomenon of ethnicity is, in other words, a complex one."
6359,在日常语言中，“族群”的概念通常会用来描述从文化上可以与多数人区别开来的少数群体，而这样的话，这一术语就包含了非常不同的情境里的一些群体——可以包括从纽约的犹太人到巴西的雅诺马马人。,"In everyday language, the concept ""ethnic group"" is normally used to describe a minority group which is culturally distinguishable from the majority, and as such the term encompasses groups in very different situations – ranging from New York Jews to the Yanomamö in Brazil."
6360,在一个著名的综述中，他宣称，宗教在其最深刻的水平上，意味着社会对它本身的崇拜。,"In a famous statement, he claimed that religion at its most profound level means society's worship of itself."
6360,这个观点有它自己的问题（尤其是功能主义者的解释难题），比如，它不能解释一个社会的居民为什么信仰祖灵，而他们的邻居却信仰丛林精神，如果承认两者都是具备社会整合能力的信仰的话。,"This view has its problems (notably the problems of functionalist explanation), for example in not explaining why the inhabitants of one society believe in ancestral spirits whereas their neighbours believe in forest spirits, granted that both would be socially integrating beliefs."
6360,一种更加不同的研究宗教的方法以格尔茨的一篇影响深远的论文《作为一种文化系统的宗教》为代表。,"A rather different approach to religion is represented in an influential essay by Geertz, ""Religion as a Cultural System""."
6361,如表9一1所示，社会生活的时间可以分为三个层次，每一个层次都与其他两个相关联。社会生活的长时段（longueduree)属于制度（法律、家庭等）的历史发展范围。,"As suggested by Figure 9.1, the temporality of social life can be broken out into three levels, each of which is interrelated to the others.The longue durée of social life is bound up with the historical development of institutions (the law, the family, etc.)."
6361,在短时段（dasein)中（或预期寿命期间），社会生活受到个人和家庭生命周期的影响，也受到特定时代社会条件特征的影响（与长时段相互作用）。,"Within the dasein, or lifespan, social life is influenced by the life cycle of individuals and families and (interacting with the longue durée) by the social conditions characteristic of their particular generation."
6361,在日常生活时段上，个人的惯常性既与社会的制度框架结构也与个人的生命周期节奏相互作用。,"And within the durée of daily life, individual routines interact with both the structure of institutional frameworks and with the rhythm of their life cycle."
6362,这个背景有助于我们认识地方的“中间状态”(‘betweenness’ of place): 即地方对观念的依赖。,"In this context it is helpful to recognize the 'betweenness' of place: that is, the dependence of place on perspective."
6362,地方存在于并且被构建于观念的主观方面；同时它被局外者看做并构建为一种外部的“其他部分”。,"Places exist, and are constructed, from a subjective point of view; while simultaneously they are constructed and seen as an external ‘other’ by outsiders."
6362,正如尼古拉斯•恩特里金指出的，“我们的邻里不仅是一块以我们自己和我们家庭为中心的地域，同时也是一块从外部或局外者的角度来看包含房屋、街道和人口的地域。因此，地方既是意义的核心又是我们行为的外部背景’。,"As Nicholas Entrikin put it, ‘Our neighborhood is both an area centered on ourselves and our home, as well as an area containing houses, streets and people that we may view from a decentered or an outsider’s perspective. Thus place is both a center of meaning and the external context of our actions’."
6362,另外，“局外者”的认识在从一个特殊具体的地方向实质上“不从属于任何地方”的情形转变时，往往变得很抽象。,"In addition, views from ‘outside’ can vary in abstraction from being in a specific place to being virtually ‘nowhere’ (i.e.an abstract, perspectiveless view)."
6363,我们中那些来自东部和中西部所谓“真正”城市的人过去还嘲笑洛杉矶。,"Those of us from the ""real"" cities of the East and Midwest used to scoff at Los Angeles."
6363,而现在事实是，我们大多数人出于非常实际的目的也在类似洛杉矶的环境中生活和工作。,"Nowadays, however, the fact is that most of us for all practical purposes live and work in LA-like environments."
6363,我在波士顿地区的大多数朋友在为128公路附近的高技术公司工作；他们每天从近郊的公寓出发到波士顿周围那些“边缘城市”上班，在美国每一个古老的大都市周围，都出现了这样一些“边缘城市”。,"Most of my friends in the Boston area work for the high-technology companies along Route 128; they commute outward from their inner-suburb homes to the ""edge cities"" that have grown up around Boston, as they have around every old U.S. metropolis."
6364,一个表现消费者优越性的观念——地位商品被广泛地接受了。,The concept of a positional good --- one that displays the superiority of the consumer --- is well established.
6364,不过，有人认为，在后现代时期已经假设消费活动具有十分重要的意义。,"However, it is argued that in postmodern society the act of consumption has assumed much greater significance."
6364,地位不再是与生俱来的了：相反，人们能够通过他们消费的商品来选择各种身份。,"No longer is position ascribed by birth: rather, people are able to choose various types of identity through the goods they consume."
6364,这个过程被描述为消费的美学化（aestheticization of consumption).,This process has been described as the aestheticization of consumption.
6365,在负偏态曲线中，曲线向高测量值周围倾斜[参见图9-8,"In negatively skewed curves, the scores are skewed around the upper values being measured (see figure 9.8"
6365,(b)]。在正偏态曲线中，数值集中在低测量值周围[参见图9-8,"(b)), and in positively skewed curves, the scores are clustered around the lower values (see figure 9.8"
6365,(c)]。,(c)).
6365,另一种极端的分布类形是J形分布，这种分布是由于频数分布中的高数值极差的内含引起的[参见图9-8,"A further type of distribution is a J-shaped distribution, which results from the inclusion of a large range of high-value scores in the frequency distribution (see figure 9.8"
6365,(d)]。,(d)).
6366,所列举的方法并不相互排斥——例如，单个案例研究也可以是本质性的或工具性的案例研究方法。,"This list is no t mutually exclusive — for example, a single case study can also be an intrinsic or an instrumental case study."
6366,同样，多案例研究或集合案例研究也可能属于本质性的或工具性的案例研究方法。,"Similarly, a multiple case study (or a collective case study) can also be an intrinsic or an instrumental case study."
6366,而且，案例研究方法也与案例研究类型有关，比如本质性单案例研究可以是探索性研究，而工具性的多案例研究 可能属于解释性研究。,"Furthermore, the research approach can also be linked into the case study type, such as a single intrinsic case study that is exploratory or a multiple and instrumental case study that is explanatory."
6367,郊区的兴起是十足由美国领导的社会转变过程，代表了一种有时被称为美国霸权周期的元素。,The rise of the suburb was very much a US-led process of social change and represents an element of what is sometimes called the American hegemonic cycle.
6367,这是沃勒斯坦主义周期性意识形态时空概念的一部分。,This is part of a Wallersteinian cyclical-ideological TimeSpace.
6367,在世界系统分析中，现代世界已经通过3个霸权周期而发展，每个周期都是以世界性霸权国家经济上的成功为基础的。,"In world-systems analysis, the modern world-system has developed through three hegemonic cycles each based upon the economic successes of a world hegemonic state."
6368,半结构化访谈属于谈话范畴，但采访者事先已就交流关注的主题拟定了问题提纲。,"Semi-structured interviews remain within the genre of a conversation; however, the interviewer has a prompt list of issues that focus the interaction."
6368,这个提纲使得访谈具备了一定结构性，尽管提纲上所讨论的事项的次序可能在访谈中有变动。,"The list adds some structure to the interview , although the ordering of the discussion about the issues on the list may vary between interviews."
6368,同非结构化访谈一样， 半结构化访谈本质上具有一定灵活性而且遵循受访者的思维过程。,"As with unstructured interviews, semi-structured interviews are fluid in nature and follow the thinking processes of the interviewee."
6369,换句话说，个体化和物、特殊性或事件的定义总是在时空中产生的。,"In other words, individuation and the definition of things, particulars or events always occurs in space-time."
6369,但是，哪一种时空呢?,But which space-time?
6369,只有定义的样态才是有趣的，对怀特海来说，那种样态总是相关性的。,"It is only the modality of the definition that is interesting and that modality is, for Whitehead, always relational."
6369,结果便消除了作为基础原则的单一位置观点。,The effect is to eliminate the idea of simple location as a grounding principle entirely.
6369,时间和空间现在被解释为“只是对包容性统一之总体性的抽象，是彼此在对方之中成形的……时空只不过是把集合体组成统一体的体系”。,"Space and time are now construed as ""simply abstractions from the totality of prehensive unifications as mutually patterned in each other ... space-time is nothing else than a system of pulling together of assemblages into unities."""
6369,因而，“事件”这个词便指“这些时空统一体中的一个”。,"The word ""event"" is then defined to mean ""one of these spatiotemporal unities."""
6370,暴雨流量分析和USLE都使用到了监测过程中收集到的数据。,Both the stormflow analysis and USLE used data collected as part of monitoring programmes.
6370,在单一地点观测的一个问题是要知道如何去概括空间的情况。,One problem with observations from a single site is knowing how to generalize across space.
6370,到目前为止，所讨论样本都是单一变量的，如土壤流失或径流形成。,The examples discussed so far relate to single variables such as soil loss or runoff response.
6371,在今天，人们常常自觉地且有意识地努力唤起一种地方感和往昔感。,The effort to evoke a sense of place and of the past is now often deliberate and conscious.
6371,但这里面包含着一种危险。,But herein lies a danger.
6371,对本真性的追逐创造了一些传统和一种商业化的遗产文化。,"The quest for authenticity, invented traditions and a commercialized heritage culture."
6372,既然我们不可能回到黑森林的小屋，那么我们能回到什么地方呢？,"We cannot turn back to the Black Forest farmhouse, but what is it that we might turn to?"
6372,再如，地方（以及地方中的自然）经验的本真性(根)这个问题就是一个难题。,"The issue of authenticity (rootedness) of the experience of place (and nature in place) is, for example, a difficult one."
6372,多威评论道，从一开始，本真性难题自身就是现代的问题。只有当现代工业化把我们同生产过程割裂开来，我们遭遇到作为已完成商品的环境时，本真性问题才出现(Dovey，1989：43)。,"To begin with, as Dovey (1989: 43) observes, the problem of authenticity is itself peculiarly modern.Only as modern industrialization separates us from the process of production and we encounter the environment as a finished commodity does it emerge."
6373,下面我们提供一个使用暗喻做编码的例子，它选自詹宁斯（1999)所进行的一个关于长期海洋巡游者的研究。,An example of the use of a metaphor for coding is drawn from a study oflong-term ocean cruisers by Jennings (1999).
6373,“镣铐束缚”是航海者用来描述三种不同情况的航海术语。,'Caught in the irons' is anautical ter m used by sailing folk to describe three types of situations.
6373,第一，这个术语描述了船只驶入“禁区”的情况，也就是说，船必须逆风而行。,"First, the term describes a situation where a boat has moved into a 'no go' zone — that is, the boat has come up to face the same direction from which the wind is coming."
6373,因此，应该使风斜掠过帆，以使得船可以朝任何方向前进或驶离有风区。,"As a result, the wind passes over the sails at an insufficient angle to enable the boat to make any forward motion or to move off the direction of the wind."
6373,第二，这一术语代表使用脚镣作为惩罚，以使得航行的船只行动一致。,"Second, the term means the use of a leg shackle as punishment to encourage conformity aboard vessels."
6373,第三，这一术语是指陷入一种难以摆脱的关系中。,"Third , the term refers to being stuck in a relationship in which one 'cannot' get out."
6373,为了保持分析过程的 “自然主义”，“镣铐束缚”这一暗喻被从最初产生的情景中剥离出来，用于对相互之间关系错综复杂的文章进行编码。,"To maintain the 'naturalism' of the analysis, the metaphor 'caught in the irons' was derived from the setting in which it emanated and was used to code text that identified relationships that were at odds with each other."
6374,编码簿是由与调査问卷相对应的答案选项的所有代码组成的。,Code books consist of a record of all the codes assigned to response set categories for each question in a survey.
6374,图9-1是一个编码簿节选的例子。,Figure 9.1 provides an example of an excerpt of a code book.
6374,为了避免原编码簿的丢失，Neuman(2000)建议做编码簿的复制本。,Neuman (2000) suggests making a copy of the code book in case the original is misplaced.
6374,这样能保证你有一个备份并且不必总是重新开始编码的过程。,This ensures that you have a backup and do not have to commence the coding process all over again.
6374,尤其是当不止一人参与数据输人过程时，做编码簿的备份更显得重要：参与的人越多，资料错位的可能性就越大，除非所有的参与者都能适时规范地遵守清晰的程序。,"Having copies of code books is especially important if more than one person is involved in data entry: the more people involved, the greater the possibility of materials being misplaced, unless there are very clear procedures in place that are followed prescriptively by all involved."
6375,因果关系研究可能源于探索性研究或描述性研究。,Causal research may be generated from either exploratory or descriptive research.
6375,因果关系研究与定量研究方法之间的联系并不是模棱两可的，为了支持或推翻两个或多个变量之间的因果关系，运用这一研究方法时通常涉及变量的使用和假说的建立。,Causal research is unambiguously linked to the use of a quantitative methodology and involves the use of variables and the construction of hypotheses to support or reject causal relationships between two or more variables.
6375,例如，研究者可能论证以下命题：在淡季由于通往省会城市的机票价格下降而可能会提高该城市的游览率。,"For example, a researcher may consider the following statement: the lowering of airfares to capital cities in the low season will increase visitation rates to those cities."
6376,在正、负偏态曲线中，中位数是集中趋势量数中比较好测量的，因为它更接近于大多数的数值，平均值并不代表典型的个案（Tilley 1999，p.125）。,"In the case of negatively and positively skewed curves, the median is a better measure of central tendency because it is closer to the majority of the scores and the mean does not represent the 'typical' case (Tilley 1999, p. 125)."
6376,在J-形分布 中，众数是比较适合的，因为它比中位数或者平均值更接近于大多数的数值（Tilley 1999，p.125）。,"In the case of J-shaped curves, the mode is more appropriate as it is closer to the majority of scores than either the median or the mean (Tilley 1999, p. 125)."
6376,关于分布的讨论引发了对于变异量数的探讨。,A discussion of distribution leads into a discussion of measures of variation.
6377,"生物地理学家和生态学家还经常通过“遍历假说”把空间和时间联系起来。该项假说作为 一种权宜的研究策略，把空间上不同区域视为时间上不同阶段（Chorley and Kennedy, 1971; Bennett and Chorley, 19788）。","Biogeographers and ecologists also often link space and time through the ‘ergodic hypothesis’ whereby, as an expedient research strategy, different areas in space are taken to represent different stages in time (Chorley and Kennedy, 1971; Bennett and Chorley, 1978)."
6377,演替过程研究就是经典例子：在局部地区内某一时刻，选取不同地点或空间单位代表该地区长期物种变化序列。,"Classic examples are in the study of vegetation successional processes, where differing locations or spatial units within a local area at one point in time are taken to represent the sequences of species changes that would occur in that area over long periods of time."
6378,这些东西的出现绝非一日之功，而是渐进的标准化与协同研究的对象，历经几个世纪才得以投入使用。,They didn’t suddenly come into existence over night but were the subject of progressive standardizations and co-ordinations that have taken centuries to put into place.
6378,而且此类事物还需海量的投资。,And they required extraordinary investments too.
6378,它们需要研制专门化设备，能够在相同地点测量相同的事物，今天基于卫星的全球定位系统(GPS)就是其最终产物。,"They required the invention of specialized devices that could measure the same things at the same places, culminating in today’s satellite-based global positioning system (GPS)."
6379,表面效度是指对于某一概念的测量看似十分恰当，那就是“可以从表面上判断”（Saramakos 1998，P.79)。,"Face validity refers to the fact that the concept being measured is being done so appropriately, that is 'on the face of it ' (Sarantakos 1998, p . 79)."
6379,例如，一份由旅游者自己完成的调查表，要实施游客对某一具体旅游吸引物的满意度调査，如果采访者设计问题时涉及对设施、舒适、服务和吸引物本身的满意度，那么我们说它具有表面效度。,"For example, an interviewer-completed questionnaire intending to establish  tourist satisfaction at a specific tourist attraction is said to have face validity if the interviewer poses questions relating to levels of satisfaction with the facilities, amenities, services and the attraction itself."
6379,如果没有涉及满意水平，则调査表就不具有表面效度。,"If no questions are asked about satisfaction levels, then the questionnaire has little face validity."
6380,我看见两个约12岁的小孩坐在史蒂文森城的一个椅子上，他们正在热烈地交谈着什么，他们的行为很规范——他们是波多黎各人。,I noticed two boys about 12 years old sitting on a Stuyvesant Town bench.
6380,突然，两个保安走来一个从北，另一个从南。,"They were deep in conversation,  quiet, well-behaved-and Puerto Rican.Suddenly two Stuyvesant Town guards were approaching --- one from the north and one from the south."
6380,其中一个指着那两个小孩向另一个打手势。,
6381,柯布西耶写道:“我们快速行驶的小车驶上一条特殊的、位于壮观的摩天大楼间的高架桥;当我们驶近时，可以看见层摩天大楼顶着的蓝天时隐时现，在我们的左右的每个单个区域的外部是一些政府和行政楼;而最外层是博物馆和大学楼群。整个城市是一个公园。”,"Le Corbusier wrote, ""Our fast car takes the special elevated motor track between the majestic skyscrapers: as we approach nearer, there is seen the repetition against the sky of the twenty-four skyscrapers; to our left and right on the outskirts of each particular area are the municipal and administrative buildings; and enclosing the space are the museums and university buildings. The whole city is a Park."""
6382,使用数学概念带来的一个使思维清晰的重要好处就是，随机模型可以替代定数模型（Lewis，1965）。,"A very important benefit to clarity of thought resulting from the use of mathem  atical concepts is that deterministic models can be replaced by stochastic models (Lewis, 1965)."
6382,自从1927年德国物理学家沃纳•海森堡（Werner K. Heisenberg）提出物理学中的不确定原则以来，这一基本概念就已经传播到其他研究领域。,"Since 1927, when Wemer K. Heisenberg, a German physicist, formulated the principle of indeterminacy in physics, the basic concept has spread to other fields of study."
6382,在物理学中，这一原则论证了要同时完全准确地测出电子的位置和速度是不可能的事情。,In physics this principle demonstrates that it is impossible to measure with full accuracy at the same time both the position and the velocity of an electron.
6383,能够用这种方法驯服的自然系统称为有弹性的系统——即通过建立新平衡的方法对管理造成的干扰作出反应。,"A natural system that can be managed in this way is said to be resilient – that is, it responds to management perturbations by adopting a new equilibrium."
6383,说明这种原理的例子很多，但主要有两种不确定性使其受到损害。,"There are abundant examples of this kind of philosophy, but there are two major types of uncertainty that undermine it."
6383,首先是极端事件能完全消除美好的意图（一场大洪水就能冲毁代表平衡状态的沙石坝）。,The first is that extreme events can obliterate the good intentions (a great flood can simply remove all the gravel bars that represent equilibrium conditions).
6383,其次，存在着未知的和未能预见的复杂情况（包括隐藏的阈限），使得对系统过分简化的看法格外危险。,"Second, there are unknown and unforeseen complications (including hidden thresholds) that make an oversimplified view of the system exceptionally dangerous."
6384,"部分和整体相互构成对方。“部分创造了整体，同时整体创造部分”(Levins and Lewontin, 1985)。","Parts and wholes are mutually constitutive of each other.""Part makes whole, and whole makes part"" (Levins and Lewontin, 1985)."
6384,这是吉登斯在有关构成理论著作中提倡的原则(行动创造了结构，同时结构创造了行动)，并且这当然也是在马克思全部著作中发挥作用的根本原则。,"This is a principle that Giddens (1984) promotes in some of his writings on structuration theory (agency makes structure and structure makes agency) and it is, of course, a fundamental principle which operates across the whole breadth and range of Marx's work."
6384,说部分和整体相互构造对方，不只是说在它们之间存在着一种反馈循环。,To say that parts and wholes are mutually constitutive of each other is to say much more than that there is a feedback loop between them.
6385,草根理论分析在本章的前面略有涉及（在第三章也有过介绍），在这里将对这种研究方法进行详细阐述。,"Grounded theory analysis was referred to briefly earlier in the chapter (and in chapter 3), and here we elaborate further on this research method."
6385,具体而言，草根理论是一种系统的定性研究方法 (Strauss & Corbin 1990，p.24)，它使得研究人员能够从所研究的现象中归纳出理论。,"Specifically, grounded theory is a systematic qualitative research method(Strauss & Corbin 1990, p. 24) that enables the researcher to inductivelygenerate theory from the phenomenon being studied."
6385,草根理论依据四条标准：适用性、可理解性、普遍性、可控制性（Strauss & Corbin 1990，p.23)。,"Grounded theorydepends on four criteria: 'fit, understanding, generality, and control'(Strauss & Corbin 1990, p. 23)."
6385,"但是，与所有的定性研究一样，“最终所创建的理论受限于这些分类、各个类别的特性和维度以及存在于所收集的真实数据中的对于它们之间关系的说明”（Strauss & Corbin丨990 , p. 112)。","However, like all qualitative research,' [y]our final theory is limited to those categories, their properties and dimensions, and statements of relationships that exist in the actual data collected' (Strauss & Corbin 1990, p. 112)."
6385,因此，草根理论是表意的，它提供的是象征性说明或“深描”；同时“确保其具有有限的普遍性”（Wolcott 1990，p.30)。,"Consequently, grounded theory is ideographic — it provides a symbolic representation or 'thick' description; and 'limited generalisation is warranted' (Wolcott 1990, p. 30)."
6386,重新考虑一下图2.6，这些实验数据似乎颇有说服力，但后来生长的差异是部分地取决于时间系列上较早出现的、可能是异常的原因。同时还有基质与地下水位下降相互作用的效应。,"Consider Figure 2.6 again; these experimental data appear reasonably convincing, but later differences in growth are determined in part by those that arise early in the time series, possibly for abnormal reasons.There is also an interaction between the effects of substrate and rate of water-table lowering."
6386,所有这些问题都意味着实验检验必须基于对背后的理论以及容许产生可检验的假设的逻辑含义的清楚了解。,"What all of these problems imply is that experimental tests must be based on a clear understanding of underlying theory, and the logical implications that allow the generation of testable hypotheses."
6387,这样一个世界中会出现我们实际上看到的空间分布非常不均匀的经济活动吗？在实际世界中，大多数人聚居在面积很小的城市里，而城市本身也是高度专业化的。,"Would such a world give rise to the highly uneven spatial distribution of economic activity we actually see, in which most people live on the small urbanized fraction of the land, and in which urban areas themselves are highly specialized?"
6387,答案当然是否定的。,"The answer, of course, is that it would not."
6387,因为这是一个不存在任何扭曲的帕累托有效的世界，因而有效的结果（同时也是市场结果）必然是在整个平原上每一种产品的生产都均匀分布，这样无须运输。,"The efficient thing (and also the market outcome, since this would be an undistorted, Pareto-efficient world) would be to have production of every commodity spread evenly across the plain, so that no transportation is necessary."
6388,在这些费用中有运输费用，所以初始命题中有一个就是制造业的配置要把运输费用减至最少。,"Among these costs are those of transport, and so among the initial propositions was one that the location of manufacturing industry is undertaken so as to minimize transport costs."
6388,从这些命题中可以发展工业分布的模型，并可得出关于特定区位的假设。,"From such propositions, models of the distribution of industry could be developed, and hypotheses about particular locations could be derived."
6388,这个理论主体已被应用于多种多样的关联域中，越愈重视各产业间在货流、服务和信息流上联系的重要性，以及把这些联系扩大为对区位的主要影响因素的要求。,"The body of theory was applied in a variety of contexts, increasingly emphasizing the importance of linkages between industries in the flow of goods, services and information, and the desire to maximize these links as a major influence on location."
6389,"这种循环模型直接暗含在现代性的作品之中（Taylor, 1999）。","This cyclical model is directly implicated in the creation of modernities (Taylor, 1999)."
6389,如前所述，现代性状态经历着不断的转变和三个盟主——新商业主义、新产业主义、新消费主义——引起的经济剧变，加剧了社会转变的程度。,"As previously noted, the condition of modernity is experienced as incessant change and the economic upheavals caused by the three hegemons – new mercantilism, new industrialism, new consumerism – intensified the degree of social change."
6389,现代性造就了大量机会与风险，寻常百姓不得不对此作出反应。,
6389,,Worlds of new opportunities and dangers were created to which ordinary people were forced to respond.
6390,常人方法论是以加芬克尔（Garfinkel.1967)以及齐默曼（Zimmerman 1971)的著作为基础，而加芬克尔创造了这个专有名词。,"Ethnomethodology is grounded in the work of Garfinkel (1967), who alsocoined the term, and Zimmerman (1971)."
6390,常人方法论将舒茨的观点扩展到了日常生活中。,Ethnomethodology is an extension of the work of Schutz applied to everyday life.
6390,常人方法论的观点认为，社会生活中并无秩序可言，所谓的秩序是由社会行动者们创造的。,"From an ethnomethodological perspective, there is no order to social life, only that ascribed by the social actors."
6391,城市经济学中有大量丰富的文献，它们大部分源自亨德森（1974）的工作，在这些文献中，一个城市系统就从这样的较量过程中产生。,"There is a well-developed literature in urban economics, largely deriving from the work of Henderson (1974), in which a system of cities evolves from such a tension."
6391,在亨德森那类模型中， 向心力来自生产中假设的当地化外部经济；离心力是城市地租。,"In Henderson-type models, the centripetal force arises from assumed localized external economies in production; the centrifugal force is urban land rent."
6391,再加上一些有关城市形成过程的假设条件，运用亨德森的方法就可建立一个决定城市数量和规模的模型（虽然它没有给出城市之间的相对位置）。,"Together with assumptions about the process of city formation, Henderson's approach yields a model of the number and sizes of cities (though not of their location relative to one another)."
6392,在地方政府撤出而留下的真空地带，自愿主义（voluntarism)开始成为满足穷人需要的主要手段，而在较富裕的社区，各种各样“偷偷摸摸的”、“私下的”政府（如业主协会）大行其道。,"In the vacuum left by the retreat of the local state, voluntarism has become a principal means of providing for the needs of the indigent, while in more affluent communities various forms of ‘stealthy’, ‘private’ governments, such as homeowner associations, have proliferated."
6392,与此同时，地方政府本身越来越转向私人部门，通过各种形式的公共-私人之间的合作去寻找资本 以进行经济和社会投资，并更加注重经济开发，而不是转向传统的地方政府提供服务和调控的职能。,"Local governments have turned increasingly to the private sector for capital for economic and social investment through public–private partnerships of various kinds, and now give much greater priority to economic development than to the traditional service-providing and regulating functions of the local state."
6392,"这种“城市企业家化""（‘civic entrepreneurialism’）导致了某种投机性的、零敲碎打的方法盛行于城市管理中，过多地强调固定项目的建设，如闹市区的商业中心、繁华热闹的市场、会议和展览中心，凡此种种，即那些被看做能够最大限度地提高不动产的价值（因而能重振地方的税基）、带来零售业的兴旺和就业增长的项目。","This ‘civic entrepreneurialism’ has fostered a speculative and piecemeal approach to the management of cities, with a good deal of emphasis on setpiece projects,  such as downtown shopping centres, festival market places, conference and exhibition centres and the like, that are seen as having the greatest capacity to enhance property values (and so revivify the local tax base) and generate retail turn-over and employment growth."
6393,持续比较分枓使研究人员得以创建草根理论。,Constant comparative analysis allows the researcher to develop groundedtheory.
6393,草根理论是在研究中 通过归纳而创立的理论。,A grounded theory is one inductively derived from the study.
6393,数据收集、分析与理论之间是相互联系的。,"Data collection, analysis, and theory are related reciprocally."
6393,依据从研究参与者的有关信仰的言论和行为中所获得的数据构建理论……这与定量范式中理论的应用截然相反。,One grounds the theory in the data from statements of belief and behavior of participants in the study . . . It is basically opposite to the use of theory in the quantitative paradigm.
6393,与证明理论不同，定性研究人员对环境进行历时研究，并依据数据创建理论(Janesick 1994，pp.218 ~ 219)。,"Instead of proving a theory, the qualitative researcher studies a setting over time and develops theory grounded in the data (Janesick 1994, pp. 218-19)."
6394,作为对日益增长的其他城市分析之合唱的回应，他们认为，城市是不断增长的各种经济和社会生活网的交点，尽管许多城市并不相互连接。,"Echoing a growing chorus of other urban analysts, they argue that cities are increasingly intersections of multiple webs of economic and social, life, many of which do not interconnect."
6394,"他们称这一城市为多元城市（multiplex city), “一个矛盾和差异的并存体，它自己生活的舞台”。","This they call the multiplex city ‘a juxtaposition of contradictions and diversities, the theatre of life itself’."
6394,博耶（1995）在美化城市（figured city)(为富人单独规划的城市）和丑化城市（disfigured city)(由穷人居住的、被忽视的、失控的城市空间）之间进行了相同的区分。,"Boyer (1995) makes a similar distinction between the  ‘figured city’ – the isolated planned city for affluent groups – and the ‘disfigured city’ – the neglected, unmanaged, spaces of the city inhabited by poorer groups."
6394,因此，关于城市我们越来越不能一般化了。,"Increasingly, then, we cannot generalize about the city."
6395,出生日期方法：在这种方法中，抽样框由参与者的出生日期构成，并采用和名称方法同样的程序进行样本单元的抽取，只是用出生日期代替了名称。,"Date of birth method With this method, the sampling frame is constructed using participants' date of birth and selection follows the same procedure as the name method, only birth dates are used instead."
6395,出生日期是随机抽取的，在抽样框中的那个日期的所有记录被确定为一个数字，接着用简单随机抽样程序(抽签方法、随机数表或电脑方法)抽取样本单位。,"A birth date is randomly selected, and all records for that date listed in the sampling frame are then assigned a number and the simple random sampling procedure (the lottery method, a table of random numbers or computer generation) is repeated."
6395,同样，这个程序的选取也可能需要重复。,
6395,,"Again, there may be several iterations of this process."
6396,答案选项在本质上应该是穷尽的、互斥的和单一尺度的。,"Responses sets should be exhaustive, mutually exclusive and unidimensional in nature."
6396,答案选项的种类包括使用对照表、排序量表、李克特量表、语义差异量表和情景法。,"Response sets include the use of checklists, ranking scales, Likert scales, semantic differential scales and scenarios."
6396,为确定问卷设计的合理应该使用前测研究。,Pilot studies should be used to ensure that the survey is well constructed.
6397,马克思指出，推动货币产生的社会交换过程表明货币是社会必要劳动时间的代表，价格是“价值的货币名称”。,"The social processes of exchange which give rise to money, Marx concluded, show that money is a representation of socially necessary labor time and price is ""the money name of value."""
6397,但过程是矛盾的，因此货币总是并不可信和并不可靠的社会劳动价值代表。,But the processes are contradictory and money is therefore always a slippery and unreliable representation of value as social labor.
6397,货币贬值、通货膨胀、投机狂潮等，所有这些都说明货币在作为价值代表时总是高度地不稳定。,"Debasement of the coinage, extraordinary rates of inflation in certain periods and places, speculative rages, all illustrate how money can itself be seriously unstable as a representation of value."
6398,描述性统计能够使调查人员以数字术语来描述收集的原始数据（Neuman 2000，p.317)。,"Descriptive statistics enable researchers to describe the aggregation of raw data in numerical terms (Neuman 2000, p. 317)."
6398,描述性统计包括使用单变量分析、双变量分析及多变量分析。,"Descriptive statistics involve the use of univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis."
6398,这些分析方法包括使用频数分布、百分比表格以及集中趋势量数。,"These methods of analysis incorporate the use of frequency distributions, percentage tables and measures of central tendency."
6398,同时也包括使用变异量数，例如：单变量分析中的极差、百分位点及标准差；双变量分析的交叉表、散点图以及相关性的测量，如卡方检验X2、系数9、Spearman等级相关系数及皮尔森积差(r)相关系数；多变量分析的X2、方差分析和多元回归分析。,"They also incorporate the use of measures of variation, such as: ranges, percentiles and standard deviation for univariate analysis; cross-tabulation, scattergrams and measures of association such as chi-square, the phi coefficient, Spearman's rho and Pearson's r for bivariate analysis; and chi-square, analysis of variance and multiple regression analysis for multivariate analysis."
6399,在《单子论》这本接近其生命终点的著作中，莱布尼茨提出一种建立在单子概念上的形而上学，单子把存在的一切都内在化了。,"In the Monadology, written towards the very end of his life, Leibniz proposes a metaphysics founded on the concept of a monad that internalizes everything there is."
6399,每一个单子都反映宇宙:“对应”法则内在地把每一单子指派成宇宙的镜子。,"Each monad mirrors the universe: a principle of ""correspondence"" internally constitutes each monad as that mirror of the universe."
6399,莱布尼茨在两个方面限定这种对应法则。,Leibniz restricts this correspondence principle in two respects.
6400,在此，我们达及了古丁所称的绿色价值理论的核心(Goodin，1992: chapter 2)。,We arrive here at the core of what Goodin (1992: chapter 2) calls a green theory of value.
6400,它是这样一种情感和主张，提供了一种“统一的道德想象”，这种想象以各种方式贯穿于几乎全部生态的和绿色的政治思维。,"It is a set of sentiments and propositions which provides a ""unified moral vision"" running, in various guises, throughout almost all ecological and green political thinking."
6400,如我们不久将看到的，它拥有激进的、自由主义的和相当保守的表现形式。,"It has radical, liberal and quite conservative manifestations as we shall shortly see."
6400,并且由于它的道德共同体强烈地依赖于地方经验，它常常指导环境政治学去保护并增进特定地方的既有品质。,"And by virtue of its strong attachment of moral community to the experience of place, it frequently directs environmental politics towards a preservation and enhancement of the achieved qualities of particular places."
6401,申请道德审查如若与研究计划的准备工作同步进行，就将拥有足够的时间等待道德审査的通过，进而也提高了通过审查的成功率和工作效率。,"When preparing a research proposal, it is sometimes expeditious tosimultaneously apply for ethical approval for your research, so that there is enough time for the ethical clearance to be processed and hopefullyapproved."
6401,同时，如果研究计划获批，这种方式也将避免整个研究进程因为等待道德审查的通过而受到影响。,"By doing this, should your proposal be accepted, your research will not be held up waiting for ethical approval."
6401,道德审査对于有关人类或非人类的研究而言都是必需的，这一点务必牢记。,"Remember,ethical clearance is needed for research involving human and/or non-human participants."
6402,地标(landmarks )，就像其名字表明的那样，是主要的方向指示物。,"Landmarks, as their name says, are prime orientation clues."
6402,但是，好的地标(landmarks )在城市里还可以发挥阐明城市秩序的两个作用。,But good landmarks in cities also perform two other services in clarifying the order of cities.
6402,首先，它们可以起到强调城市的多样性(并且增加这种强调的意义)的作用;通过表明它们与其邻居的差异，可以把人们的注意力吸引过来，而且因为有差异，所以它们才显得重要。,"First, they emphasize(and also dignify)the diversity of cities; they do this by calling attention to the fact that they are different from their neighbors, and important because they are different."
6403,时间和空间概念影响着我们理解世界的方式。,Concepts of space and time affect the way we understand the world to be.
6403,它们也提供了一种参照体系，借助于这个体系，我们定位自己与世界的关系(或者用第三章的语言来说，定义自己的“情境性”和“位置性”)。,"And they also provide a reference system by means of which we locate ourselves (or define our ""situatedness"" and ""positionality,"" to use the language of chapter 3) with respect to that world."
6403,因此，进一步讨论时间和空间而不使用“位置”(place)这个术语，这是不可能的。,"It is therefore impossible to proceed far with a discussion of space and time without invoking the term ""place."""
6403,这反过来会影响我们“安置”(place)事物，特别是思考事物秩序中的“我们的位置”。,"This in turn has implications for how we ""place"" things and how we think of ""our place"" in the order of things in particular."
6404,"但是,把一个三维实体(地景)压扁成一维尺度损失了大量信息,而且这些一维变量被证明同样是不精密和不十分准确的。","However, the collapse of a three-dimensional entity (the landscape) into one- dimensional measurements loses a great deal of information, and these variables proved equally imprecise, and not very accurate."
6404,测量河流流速的例子也把吸引力导向许多地理学测量中的维度变化问题。,The example of measuring flow velocity in rivers also draws attention to the change in dimensionality of much measurement in geography.
6404,"在利用电动机械流速仪测量一个方向主流方向)时间平均流速的地方,以高频率进行测量的现代仪器还测量两个或三个正交的方向。",
6405,早在有文字记载之前，人们即使只是离开居住地较短的距离，也会发现不同地区之间的差异。,"Long before the dawn of written history, men who explored even just a short distance from home were aware of differences that distinguished one place from another."
6405,这就产生了地区差异的概念。,The concept of areal differentiation had been bom.
6405,其中一些人试图将当时人们认知以外地区的景象抽象成意像（mental images），并告诉其他人。,Some people were drawn to the challenge of forming mental images of what it was like beyond the horizon and communicating these images to others.
6405,这种地球表面的差异就是约翰•赖特（John K. Wright）所说的“地理多样性”（geodiversity）。,The differentiation of the face of the earth is what John K. Wright called “geodiversity.”
6406,最近几年，人们提出了这样一种与众不同但却相当普及的主张:“空间”规定了差异、他性、没有管束、不可预见、意外等等领域，因此也规定作用地点和解放政治支点。,"In recent years, the extraordinary, but now quite widespread claim, has been advanced that ""space"" defines the realm of difference, of otherness, the uncontrolled, the unpredictable, the unexpected, and, hence, the locus of agency and the leveraging point for emancipatory politics."
6406,空间为全部有关社会过程的元理论规定了不可驯服的残余。,Space defines the untamable residual to all metatheories of the social process.
6406,这些非常强烈的主张值得我们批判性详察。,These are very strong claims that deserve critical scrutiny.
6406,它们预示了这个问题，如何理解有关行动和社会决定问题的差异地理学和理论化的空间性。,"They presage the question of how to understand the geography of difference, the spatiality of theorizations, in relation to the issues of agency and social determination."
6407,迄今为止，地理学史都是以一种狭隘的、非批判性的方式编写的，而且通常被用以证明当前各种地理学支持者的活动和观点都是合理的。,"Until recently, the history of geography was written in narrow, uncritical terms and was usually invoked to legitimize the activities and perspectives of different geographical constituencies in the present."
6407,本学科的历史是在知识真空中进行研究，与外部的经济、社会、政治和文化势力隔离开来。,"The discipline’s past was presented in an intellectual vacuum, sealed off from external economic, social, political or cultural forces."
6407,然而，近年来地理学史呈现为一种较少内省、较少为自我服务和较少目的论的研究方式。,"More recently, however, the history of geography has been presented in a less introspective, self-serving and teleological fashion."
6408,在地统计学领域中近期的发展包括空间自相关技术和克里格法等方法，最初是为了把矿体中矿物浓度的变化绘制成图。,"More recent developments in the field of geostatistics include spatial autocorrelation techniques and methods such as kriging, originally developed to map variation in mineral concentrations within ore bodies."
6408,克里格法能够帮助识别出哪些尺度其过程是重要的，不同的现象是怎样在空间中显示出连贯性的。,Kriging helps identify the scales over which certain processes remain important and how different phenomena show continuity in space.
6408,这些方法大大改进了传统的制图技术——过去，当遇到空间中分散的观测物时，需要综合运用知识、判断和纯粹的猜测在图上画出等值线。,"Such methods provide a real improvement on traditional mapping techniques – in the old days, when faced with a scatter of observations in space, one used a mixture of knowledge, judgement and pure guesswork to draw the isolines on a map."
6409,描述频数分布的其他方法有折线图、直方图、地图绘制法以及人口锥形图。,"Other methods of representing frequency distributions are polygons, histograms, cartographs and population pyramids."
6409,折线图是由直线连接的点构成的，大多用于离散数据。,Polygons consist of dots joined by lines and are mostly used with interval data.
6409,直方图是由彼此挨着的垂直长方条构成的。,Histograms are graphs with vertical bars adjoining each other.
6409,连接这些长方条的中点，就能够制成频数的折线图。,These can be made into a frequency polygon by joining the midpoints of the bars.
6409,"地图绘制法在地图上描述频数,形象地确定了所描述变量的位置和重要性(Sanmtakos 1998)。",Cartographs demonstrate frequencies on a map to visually identify the location and magnitude of the variable being represented (Sarantakos 1998).
6409,人口锥形图通常描述两个变量（例如，性别和年龄）来彼此互相对比，它是使用水平位置的线条来描述频数的。,Population pyramids usually portray two variables (such as sex and age) in comparison to each other using horizontally positioned bars to represent the frequencies.
6410,柏拉图在《蒂迈欧篇》（Timaeus）和《克利蒂亚斯篇》（Critias）中提及了亚特兰蒂斯城。,Plato also related the story of Atlantis in the Timaeus and the Critias.
6410,他说到，希腊世界在公元前9000年曾遭到来自西部某个地区并有着高度文明的民族的入侵。,"The Greek world, he said, was about to be invaded in the year 9000b.c. by a highly civilized people who lived somewhere to the west."
6410,希腊军队经过激烈的斗争，才获得胜利，但是恰恰在入侵者被击败的同时，他们的家乡发生了强烈的地震，然后沉人大海。,"The Greek armies, after a fierce struggle, were victorious, but just as the invaders were defeated, their homeland suffered a disastrous earthquake and sank beneath the sea."
6411,在1932年，李克特发明了一种等级测量法以衡量态度。,"In 1932, Likert developed a rating scale to measure attitudes."
6411,李克特量表的格式包括一系列与研究课题相关的项目——比如海滨城镇的娱乐场所发展对社会影响的各个方面。,"The construction of Likert scales involves the generation of a number of items related to a research topic — for example, items related to the social impact of a casino development in a coastal town."
6411,首先，收集大量关于课题的项目；然后围绕这些项目设计问题，并准备五种答案，如：非常赞同、赞同、不确定、不赞同、非常反对。,"Initially, a large number of items are generated in relation to the topic.Statements using those items are then prepared with a five-point response set using, for example, strongly agree, agree, undecided, disagree, strongly disagree."
6412,传统城市模型的做法是：假定对厂商而言，规模报酬递增是完全外生的，从而允许建模者继续使用完全竞争的假设。,"Traditional urban models do so by assuming that increasing returns are purely external to firms, allowing the modeler to continue to assume perfect competition."
6412,不过这里采用的方法避免了对外部经济的任何直接假定：以单个厂商水平上的规模经济为基础，厂商们在市场上相互影响的结果就会产生外部性。,"The approach taken here, however, involves avoiding any direct assumption of external economies: externalities emerge as a consequence of market interactions involving economies of scale at the level of the individual firm."
6412,因此我们必须设法模型化一个不完全竞争的市场结构。,Thus we must somehow model an imperfectly competitive market structure.
6412,这一类模型中最实用的当然是迪克西特一斯蒂格里茨（1977）的垄断竞争模型。,"The workhorse model of this kind is, of course, the Dixit-Stiglitz (1977) model of monopolistic competition."
6413,迪斯尼哲学的最终目标是在奥兰多创造一个庆典城市，一个完整的、私有的居住社区，在这里，伴随社会极化的紧张关系能够被排除。,"The ultimate extension of the Disney philosophy is the creation of Celebration City in Orlando, an integrated, privatized, residential community in which the tensions associated with social polarization can be excluded."
6413,然而，索金认为在后现代时代，城市作为一个整体正在变成一个巨大的 “主题公园”，各种模拟物表现出一个髙度扭曲的世界观（一个他称作非地理化（ageographia) 的空间）。,Sorkin argues that in a postmodern era the city has a whole is becoming one big ‘theme park’ in which a variety of simulations present a highly distorted view of the world (a space he terms ageographia).
6413,其结果是，当代城市中各种各样的后现代主义建筑代表了文化的肤浅表面（这可以称之为迪斯尼化（Disneyfication））。,The result is that the diverse postmodern buildings of the contemporary city present a shallow facade of culture (sometimes termed Disneyfication).
6414,第一种方法是数置方法（quantitative approach)，它试图通过使用以地图、图表和数学公式的形式表现出来的统计数据来描述城市的地理结构。,"First there is the quantitative approach, which attempts to provide descriptions of the geographical structure of cities using statistical data represented in the form of maps, graphs, tables and mathematical equations."
6414,采用这种方法很大程度上是受到新古典经济学（neo-classical economics)和功能主义社会学（functionalist sociology)的启发。,Much of the inspiration for this approach has come from neoclassical economics and functionalist sociology.
6414,这些方法的目标是希望能够“科学地”，也就是通过使用一种不会受到观察者的价值和观点影响的分析方法来客观地描述城市。,"These approaches aim to be ‘scientific’, providing objective descriptions of cities in such a way that the values and attitudes of the observer do not influence the analysis."
6414,这种试图将观察者和观察物分开的方法被称为笛卡儿法（Cartesian approach)。这种方法是以哲学家笛卡儿的名字命名的。,"This attempt to separate the observer from the observed is often termed the Cartesian approach, after the philosopher Descartes."
6415,把万物都还原为洪流和潮流，随后对全部形式和位置之短暂性的强调便有自身的限制。,"The reduction of everything to fluxes and flows, and the consequent emphasis upon the transitoriness of all forms and positions has its limits."
6415,如果全部固定的东西总是瞬间就烟消云散，那么做成什么事都是很困难的，甚至做出什么决定也都很难。,"If everything that is solid is always instantaneously melting into air, then it is very hard to accomplish anything or even set one's mind to do anything."
6415,面对这种困难，回到简单的基本信仰(不管它们是右派对家庭的崇拜，还是左派对“抵抗”的崇拜)，以及抛弃无法控制的以过程为基础的论证，都是很强的诱惑。,"Faced with that difficulty the temptation is strong to go back to some simple foundational beliefs (whether these be a fetishism of the family on the right or of something called ""resistance"" on the left) and dismiss the process-based arguments out of hand."
6416,因此，在城市化过程中，似乎没有任何一个地方能够发动为系统转型提供动力的战斗的特殊主义。,There seems then to be no place within the urbanization process from which to launch any kind of militant particularism capable of grounding the drive for systemic transformations.
6416,特别是最近20年来，“全球化”辞令已经变得特别重要，甚至在激进思想中代替了更具政治性的帝国主义、殖民主义和新殖民主义等概念。,"In the last 20 years in particular, the rhetoric of ""globalization"" has become particularly important, even replacing within segments of radical thought the more politicized concepts of imperialism, colonialism, and neo-colonialism."
6416,这种话语转向的意识形态结果特别地剥夺了各种形式的地方、城市甚至国家的政治行动的能力。,"The ideological effect of this discursive shift has been extra-ordinarily disempowering with respect to all forms of local, urban, and even national political action."
6417,二手资料总是存在信度问题。,There is always a question of reliability with secondary documents.
6417,第“二”个研究者并不总是知道初始资料是为什么或怎么样产生的，也不很了解它们究竟属于哪种文化环境。,The 'secondary' researcher does not always know how and why the original documents were produced or the cultural setting in which they were produced.
6417,"正如塔茨曼（Tuchman 1994, p. 321）所评论的那样：要知道，所有的资料，不论是原始资料还是二手资料来源，都是有问题的。不要梦想着存在“自然的”、可预期的甚至是真实的资料。","As Tuchman (1994, p. 321) comments: 'Ask questions of all data, primary and secondary sources. Do not assume that anything about data is ""natural,"" inevitable, or even true.'"
6418,第二类多样性是指那些为回应第一种用途而发展起来的商业(商店和服务设施），主要是服务于被首要用途吸引来的人群。,"Secondary diversity is a name for the enterprises that grow in response to the presence of primary uses, to serve the people the primary uses draw."
6418,如果这第二类多样性（secondary diversity）只单一地服务于首要用途，那么不管这是什么形式的用途，注定是无效的。,"If this secondary diversity serves single primary uses, no matter what the type of use, is innately inefficient."
6418,如果要想产生内在的有效的作用，那就需要服务于多个的混合首要用途，如果其他的三个生发多样性的条件也被充分注意的话，那么这种有效性则会是惊人的。,"Serving mixed primary uses, it can be innately efficient and --- if  the other three conditions for generating diversity are favorable also --- it can be exuberant."
6419,电话调査主要是结构式访谈，采用封闭式问题。访问者使用电话技术与受访者交流，并记录答案。,"Telephone surveys are primarily structured interviews using closed questions, with an interviewer recording the respondent's answers.Contact with respondents is made using telephone technology."
6419,计算机技术可以协助电话技术，在这种情况下，使用软件程序可以迅速记录受访者的回答，分析程序也有助于整合应答访谈数据。,"Telephone technology may be further assisted by computer technology, in which case the responses are immediately recorded using software programs that integrate the responses with analysis procedures."
6420,访员直接输入数据一般是与电话采访和“计算机辅助电话访谈”（CATI）设施 相关的。,Direct entry of data is generally associated with telephone interviewing and computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) facilities.
6420,通过使用“计算机辅助私人访谈”（CAPI）技术，直接的编码也是有可能的。,Direct coding is also possible through the use of computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI) technology.
6420,这种技术允许访员以及受访者自己直接输入。,This technology allows direct entry by the interviewer as well as by respondents themselves.
6420,计算机辅助电话访谈设施 （CATI）的使用在下面的行业透视中将会被讨论。,Use of CATI facilities is discussed in the following Industry Insight.
6421,电脑方法：随机抽样可以由电脑程序产生。,Computer method Random samples may be generated by computer programs.
6421,"这时,研究者必须能够获得抽样框，如旅客名单、旅馆名录、景区名册、俱乐部名单或组织成员名单。","The researcher has to have access to a sampling frame, such as a passenger list, an accommodation listing, an attractions list, or a list of club or association members."
6421,在抽样框中每个对象被指定一个号码。,Each individual entry on the sampling frame is assigned a number.
6421,将要抽取的随机号码的总数是确定的，接着计算机程序就可以识别抽样单位。,The number of random numbers to be selected is determined and then the sample units are identified by the computer program.
6422,数据输入可以采用转换表、页缘编码、直接的数据输入、调査者直接输入数据以及扫描仪（Babbie 1995，pp.369 ~ 372)。,"Data can be entered using: transfer sheets; edge-coding; direct data entry; direct data entry by interviewers; scanners (Babbie 1995, pp . 369-72)."
6422,数据也可以使用电子数据表进行输入，或者使用笔、记录纸单进行人工输入。,"It can also be entered using spreadsheets, as well as being entered manually using pen and paper recording sheets."
6422,在讨论数据编码的第三阶段——数据整理——之前，我们先简要地概括各种数据输入的方法。,"Each method is briefly overviewed prior to discussing the third phase of data coding, that is data cleaning."
6423,电子问卷是最近涌现的一种收集数据的调查法。同邮寄调査一样，调査员与受访者之间没有直接的互动。,"E-questionnaires are a more recent way of collecting data using surveys, in this case questionnaires, e-questionnaires are similar to mail surveys as there is no direct interaction between the researcher and the respondent."
6423,然而，我们可以利用在线和实时谈话频道组织更多的交流和开放性访问，当然也能集中群组讨论。,"However, undernets and real time chat channels can be used to conduct more interactive and open-ended 'interviews', as well as focused group discussions."
6423,此外，还可使用公告板来研究有相似兴趣的群体。,"Furthermore, bulletin boards can be used to study a group with similar interests."
6424,加利福尼亚学派中的另一个重要研究主题是，在一个充满暴力和犯罪的环境里社会中较富裕阶层所使用的防御措施的发展。,Another important theme associated with urbanization under a regime of flexible accumulation is increasing social polarization and the development of protective measures by the more affluent sections of society in an environment in which violence and crime are routine.
6424,这可以看做是对前文提到的不断增加的社会极化的一个回应。这些防范措施的一个典范是一种被称为碉堡式建筑（bunker architecture)(也称为“城堡式”、“增强式”或者“妄想狂式”建筑）的增多：城市的发展伴随着院门、栅栏和围墙、保安、红外感应器、行动监视器、与警察局的快速反应联系以及诸如有线电视这样的监视装置。,"One manifestation of these defensive measures is the growth of so-called bunker architecture (also termed ‘citadel’, ‘fortified’ and ‘paranoid’architecture): urban developments with gates, barriers and walls, security guards, infra-red sensors, motion detectors, rapid response links with police departments and surveillance equipment such as CCTV."
6425,资料三角校正是指研究者在研究过程引入多种资料来源。,Researchers concerned with data triangulation draw on various sources of data in the research process.
6425,调查者三角校正是指研究中雇用若干个研究者或评论者。,Investigator triangulation refers to the employment of several researchers or evaluators in a study.
6425,理论三角校正是指研究者用几种方法或视角分析资料。,Theory triangulation involves researchers using several theories or perspectives to analyse data.
6425,方法论的三角校正是指研究者使用多种方法收集与研究相关的资料。,Methodological triangulation involves researchers using several methods to gather data relevant to a study.
6426,定比测量法根据升序或降序分类，具有相同的间隔距离，特别的是最低单位可以是0。,"Ratio measures have classificatory categories based on ascending or descending rank order, equal interval spaces and the addition of a zero point as the lowest unit."
6426,当然定比测量没有必要从0开始（Kumar 1996）。,Interval measures do not necessarily commence at zero (Kumar 1996).
6426,定距测量用于人口统计分类，比如年龄、收入水平或旅游团的人数。,Ratio measures are used with demographic variables such as age or income levels or number of people in a travel group.
6427,定距测量法是定序测量法的拓展。,Interval measures are a further development of the ordinal measure.
6427,定距测量保持类别间相等的间隔，如：0-15岁，16-30岁，31-45岁，46-60岁。,"Interval measures are a further development of the ordinal measure.Interval measures contain equal separations between categories, such as 0-15 years, 16-30 years, 31-45 years and 46-60 years."
6427,每一类别的上下限之间都相差15岁。,Each category has an interval of 15 years separating the upper and lower limits.
6427,定距测量也用于日历时间，例如日、周、月、旅行距离和停留时间。,"Interval measures are also used with calendar time, such as days, weeks and months, distance travelled and duration of stay."
6428,封闭式问题有四种不同的测量层次:定类、定序、定距及定比层次。,"Closed-ended questions are measured at different levels: nominal, ordinal,interval and ratio levels."
6428,定类测量法使用名词等语词对答案选项加以分类。,The nominal measure is associated with the use of words or nouns to classify response sets.
6428,它通常使用“其他”选项，以此保证包括所有的类别。,Nominal measures usually include the use of 'other' to ensure all categories have been included.
6429,若成立，该假说则会成为解释所研究的现象的理论框架。,"If accepted, the hypothesis becomes the theoretical construct to explain the phenomenon being studied."
6429,定量研究方法把来源于被调查者的信息抽象成统计资料，而不是对现象做简单的文字描述。,A quantitative methodology abstracts data from the participants into statistical representations rather than textual pictures of the phenomenon.
6429,整个研究过程是客观的，且结果对研究总体具有代表性。,The entire research process is objectively constructed and the findings are usually representative of the population being studied.
6430,在1960年代，学界的兴趣和重点放在用这些地层事件推断第四纪地质事件发生的历史序列。,"In the 1960s, the interest and emphasis lay in using these stratigraphic events to infer the historical sequence of events in the Quaternary period."
6430,断代方法多种多样，从沉积岩简单的叠置规则(越深越老)到放射性同位素定年。,Dating methods ranged from the simple rule of superimposition for sedimentary rocks (deepest are oldest) to radio-isotope dating.
6430,随着断代方法的改进，历史序列的精度也在改进。,"As the methods of dating improved, so the precision of the historical sequence could also be improved."
6431,人文地理学中时间以两种不同方式概念化(见第七章对自然地理学中时间的论述）。,"In human geography, time has been conceptualized in two distinct ways (see Chapter 7 on time in physical geography)."
6431,对时间的一种看法是将之作为一种物理维度，能够精确测量的东西。,"One view of time is as a physical dimension, something that can be measured precisely."
6431,例如，地理学家可能把“时间维”加到聚落模型中，以表明在某个时期内这些模型是如何发展的。,"Thus a geographer might add a ‘time dimension’ to a model of, say, settlements to show how patterns have developed over a given period."
6431,这样的模型称为“动态模型”(与之相对的是描述某一时间事物状态的静态模型），此类模型依靠时间序列数据与分析。,Such models are called dynamic models (in contrast to ‘static models’ that describe a situation at one point in time) and rely on time-series data and analysis.
6432,“动态平衡”包括因不断侵蚀而导致的渐进性地形发育。,A ‘dynamic equilibrium’ involves progressive evolution of landform as a response to ongoing erosion.
6432,很多能够影响区域尺度地貌的重大气候变化也是在这种时间尺度上进行的——例如，整个大陆冰盖的进退。,"This is also the timescale at which major changes in climate can affect landforms at the regional scale – for example, advances and retreats of ice sheets over entire continents."
6432,"乔利等（Chorley et al., 1984）深入讨论了地貌中的尺度问题，而索恩斯（Thornes）则详细探讨了时间问题（第七章）。","Chorley et al. (1984) provide further discussion of the scale issue in geomorphology, while time is discussed in more detail by Thornes (Chapter 7)"
6433,读者因素准备研究计划时还需要了解目标读者。,"Audience considerationsWhen preparing a research proposal, you need to be aware of your audience."
6433,读者可能是普通大众、旅游组织/协会、政府机关、商业管理者、其他研究者或学者。,"The audience may be the general public, tourism organisations and associations, government agencies, business managers, other researchers or academics."
6433,不同的读者对写作形式有不同的要求（语调、音调、语气和风格）。,"Each audience will require a specific style of writing (tone, tenor, mode and genre)."
6433,以上问题将于本章的报告部分进行详细讨论。,This is discussed in detail in the report section later in the chapter.
6434,在《单子论》这本写于晚年的著作中，莱布尼茨提出一种建立在单子概念上的形而上学，单子把存在的一切都内在化了。,"In the Monadology, written towards the very end of his life, Leibniz proposes a metaphysics founded on the concept of a monad that internalizes everything there is."
6434,每一个单子都反映宇宙：“对应”法则内在地把每一单子指派成宇宙的镜子。,"Each monad mirrors the universe: a principle of ""correspondence"" internally constitutes each monad as that mirror of the universe."
6434,莱布尼茨在两个方面限定这种对应法则。,Leibniz restricts this correspondence principle in two respects.
6435,在随机抽样中，研究者可以使用多种表格来帮助决定样本容量。,There are various tables available to researchers to assist in decision making regarding sample size in probability samples.
6435,本章后边罗列了一些这样的表格。随机抽样方法较多，包括简单随机抽样（simple random sampling)、系统抽样（systematic sampling)、分层随机抽样（stratified random sampling)和多阶整群抽样（multistage cluster sampling) 。,"Examples of such tables are presented later in the chapter.There are a number of random sampling approaches: simple random sampling, systematic sampling, stratified random sampling and multistage cluster sampling."
6436,这些可憎的思想反映了一种占优势的正统，但同时也激起了热烈的辩论。,Such distasteful ideas reflected a prevailing orthodoxy but they also provoked spirited debate.
6436,尽管环境决定论和科学种族主义常常互相强化，但也可能互相矛盾。,"While environmental determinism and scientific racism were often mutually reinforcing ideas, they could also contradict one another."
6436,有些种族论者假定，各“种族”均被固定在一个不变的“天然”级序，这个级序就是从不同起点出发的截然不同的发育系列中当前的表现(多元发生论)。,"Some racial theorists assumed that different ‘races’ were fixed in an unchanging ‘natural’ hierarchy, the contemporary manifestation of quite distinct evolutionary sequences from different points of departure (polygenesis)."
6437,城市也对主观性有重要影响，因为它使不同的人群在很小的范围内同时存在。,Urban environments also have a crucial impact upon subjectivities because they tend to bring together in close juxtaposition many different types of people.
6437,这样的混合就要求部分城市居民做出反应，不管这种反应是漠不关心、害怕、不情愿、不了解、尊敬，还是妒忌。,"This mingling requires a response on the part of the city dweller, whether this is indifference, fear, loathing, incomprehension, admiration or envy."
6437,有时，这些比较是建立在被讨论人群的原型基础上的，这些原型是通过夸张、简化或歪曲的描述得来的。,"Sometimes these comparisons are based on stereotypes ---exaggerated, simplified or distorted interpretations --- of the group in question."
6437,当然，对于二元论(binaries两分法）的应用通常集中在对这些差异的创造上（即男性/女性，健康/疾病，正常/发疯，异性恋/同性恋，本国人/外国人，真实/欺骗）。,"Indeed, the use of binaries --- two-fold divisions --- is often central to the creation of these differences (e.g.male/female, healthy/sick, sane/mad, heterosexual/homosexual, non-foreigner/foreigner, authentic/fake)."
6438,第二个就是行动问题。,
6438,,"Secondly, there is the related problem of agency."
6438,由于不再把工人阶级当作当代历史当事人，法兰克福学派在寻求替代性的行动地点时就存在着困难。,"Having laid aside the working class as the agent of contemporary history, the Frankfurt School had difficulty in finding an alternative locus of action."
6438,固然，有几个人发现了某种替代，如马尔库塞信任(由爱欲武装起来的)青年造反派，哈贝马斯在新社会运动中致力于建构一种交往行动的伦理学。,"To be sure, several of them found some sort of alternative — Marcuse put his faith in youthful rebellion (powered by Eros) and Habermas in new social movements dedicated to the construction of an ethics of communicative action."
6439,也许公共部门在城市形态重构上的最著名实例要数精神健康服务的反机构化（deinstitutionalization)导致城市无家可归者的方式。,Perhaps the best-known example of public sector restructuring upon urban form is the way that the deinstitutionalization of mental health services has contributed to urban homelessness.
6439,反机构化包括关闭为诸如精神病人、学习障碍者、老年人或者严重残疾者这样的有需求群体提供长期服务业的大型机构，以及发展基于社区的各种形式的服务业。,"Deinstitutionalization involves the closure of large institutions that provide long-term care for needy groups --- such as the mentally-ill, those with learning difficulties, the elderly or severely disabled --- and the development of a variety of community-based forms of care."
6439,后者包括小型专门设施，或者也可以包括在基于社区的诸如家庭护士、医生、社会工作者和见习官员等专业服务队提供帮助的情况下，由家庭成员或朋友进行的私人家庭照料。,"The latter include smaller purpose-built facilities or it can involve care within private households by families or friends supplemented by teams of community-based professionals such as home nurses, doctors, social workers and probation officers."
6440,下面举例说明把一般事务转化为可研究问题的困难：欧洲以至全球许多河谷平原森林的衰退。,"An example will illustrate this difficulty of turning a general issue into a researchable problem: the decline of floodplain woodland in many river valleys in Europe and, indeed, globally."
6440,河流的渠道化和流量管理把这些河流与泛滥平原相隔离，导致洪水频率、河道迁移速率以及泛滥平原沉积物含水层充水的速率都降低了。,"Channelization and river-flow management have separated rivers from their floodplains, leading to reductions of flood frequency, of rates of channel migration, and of recharge of floodplain sedimentary aquifers."
6440,这些变化又导致河边木本树种繁殖机会降低、生境损失和生物多样性降低。,"In turn, this has caused reduced opportunities for the regeneration of woody riparian species, a loss of habitat, and a reduction in biodiversity."
6441,这些发展的一个主要结果就是公司变得更小了。,A major consequence of these developments is that firms are becoming much smaller.
6441,其主要原因是现有公司的细分（有时被称作垂直分化（vertical disintegration))，以及新的小公司的快速增长。,This has arisen because existing firms have been subdivided (sometimes known as vertical disintegration) as well as through the rapid growth of new small firms.
6441,与福特制支配下的内部规模经济不同，后福特制企业建立在外部范围经济上。,"Rather than the internal economies of scale dominant under Fordism, neo-Fordist firms are therefore based on external economies of scope."
6441,范围经济 (Economies of scope)是这样一些因素，它们使得生产系列产品成为可能，而不是生产单个产品。,Economies of scope are factors that make it possible to produce a range of products rather than to produce an individual item on its own.
6441,当企业所属的产业做大时（例如，有大量的生产者），外部范围经济（External economies of scope)就得到增长。,External economies of scope arise when the industry to which the firm belongs to is large (i.e.there are a large number of producers).
6442,推断统计需要使用概率抽样，它对检验假设及其与所研究总体之间的关系有重要意义。,Inferential statistics require the use of probability sampling and are important to test a hypothesis and its relationship to the overall population being studied.
6442,推断统计的检验包括X2(用于定类测量层次)及方差分析(ANOVA)(用于定距测量层次）。,Tests of inferential statistics include chi-square (used with nominal levels of measurement) and ANOVA (used with interval levels of measurement).
6442,推断统计也包括研究人员检验统计显著性、考虑统计显著性水平以及一类错误、二类错误。,"Inferential statistics also involve researchers in tests of statistical significance, consideration of levels of significance, and Type I and Type II errors."
6443,特别要说明的是，巡游者的民族志研究使用了五种形式的三角校正：资料三角校正、调查者三角校正、理论三角校正、方法的三角校正（Denzin 1978）和跨学科三角校正（Janesick 1994，p.251）。,"Specifically, the ethnographic study of cruisers used five forms of triangulation: data triangulation, investigator triangulation, theory triangulation, methodological triangulation (Denzin 1978) and interdisciplinary triangulation (Janesick 1994, p. 251)."
6443,本文将只对与旅游动机相关的调查结果进行讨论。,Only the findings from the study that have relevance to travel motivations will be discussed in this paper.
6443,这些调查结果将按照前面讨论过的四种理论分类进行组织。,These findings are organised using each of the four 'theoretical' groupings previously discussed.
6444,一旦根据研究项目的信息需要确定了研究方法，就必须选择一种合适的方法论和资料收集（分析）工具。,"Once the approach (or approaches) has been determined in regard to the information needs of a research project, an appropriate methodology has to be selected and suitable tools for data collection (and analysis) have to be chosen."
6444,在前一节中提到了定性、定量和两者结合的研究方法。,
6444,,"In the previous section, reference was made to qualitative, quantitative and mixed method methodologies."
6444,这些研究方法由一些特定的范式（实证主义、解释社会学、批判理论、女性主义视角、后现代主义和混沌理论）所指导，这些范式将在第二章进行详述。,"These methodologies are governed by specific paradigms (positivism, interpretive social sciences, critical theory, feminist perspectives, postmodernism and chaos theory) that will be discussed in detail in chapter 2."
6445,我提出的方法可以叫做房租担保法。,This method I am proposing can be called the ganranteed-rent method.
6445,这个方法涉及的是单幢房子或楼房，而不是那些成片廉租住宅房，这些房子坐落在其他楼房之间，有新的，也有旧的。,"The physical units involved would be buildings, not projecters----buildings to go among other buildings, old and new, on city streets."
6445,那些进人这个房租担保方法的房子其样式和大小应该都是各色各样的，考虑的因素有街区和所处地方的大小的不同，房子的类型跟常见的平常房子该考虑的因素没有什么两样。,"These guaranteed-rent buildings would be of different kinds and sizes, depending on their kind of neighborhood, the size of the plot, and all such considerations as normally influence the size and type of more or less average buildings."
6446,为了探寻本质， 批评理论研究者主要使用定性研究法。,"To get below the surface, the critical theorist researcher will predominantly use a qualitative methodology."
6446,此外，如上所述，该研究过程是主观的，这就使得研究结果在很大程度上会受到研究者价值观的影响。,"Furthermore, as outlined above, the process is subjective and, as a consequence, the process is also value laden."
6446,批评理论研究者所采用的具体方法包括参与观察法、深度访谈、焦点群体法、德尔菲法以及评价调査法，他们用这些方法揭露被研究的少数群体所承受的压迫和剥削。,"Methods used by a critical theorist researcher would include, for example, participant observation, indepth interviewing, focus groups, Delphic panels and appreciative inquiry in order to expose the oppression, subjugation and exploitation of the minority group being studied."
6447,访问者完成问卷需要访问者在现场，而自填式问卷则不需要。,"Interviewer-completed questionnaires require the presence of an interviewer, whereas self-completion questionnaires do not."
6447,与访问者完成问卷相比，自填式问卷的回答率较低。这是因为在问卷完成过程中缺乏面对面的交流。,Response rates are lower for self-completion questionnaires compared with interviewer-completedquestionnaires due to lack of face-to-face interaction during questionnaire completion.
6448,"思里夫特(Thrift, 1999:318)坚称文化地理学“常常似乎把代表性作为其中心问题，对自身造成了损害”，并提出关于舞蹈和其他具体化实践的“非代表性理论”。",Thrift (1999: 318) argues that cultural geography ‘often seems to have taken representation as its central focus to its detriment’ and proposes a ‘non-representational theory’ of dance and other embodied practices.
6448,"如纳什(Nash, 2000: 656)所述：“思里夫特鼓吹惯常的、背离解构代表性的微观地理学(microgeographies)，去探索非代表性。”","As Catherine Nash (2000: 656) writes: ‘Thrift is advocating a new and demanding direction for cultural geography, away from the analysis of texts, images and discourses, and towards understanding the micro-geographies of habitual practices, departing from deconstructing representations to explore the non-representational’."
6449,迪斯尼哲学的最终目标是在奥兰多创造一个庆典城市，一个完整的、私有的居住社区，在这里，伴随社会极化的紧张关系能够被排除。,"The ultimate extension of the Disney philosophy is the creation of Celebration City in Orlando, an integrated, privatized, residential community in which the tensions associated with social polarization can be excluded."
6449,然而，索金认为在后现代时代，城市作为一个整体正在变成一个巨大的 “主题公园”，各种模拟物表现出一个髙度扭曲的世界观（一个他称作非地理化 ageographia的空间）。,Sorkin  argues that in a postmodern era the city has a whole is becoming one big  ‘theme park’ in which a variety of simulations present a highly distorted view of the world (a space he terms ageographia).
6449,其结果是，当代城市中各种各样的后现代主义建筑代表了文化的肤浅表面（这可以称之为迪斯尼化（Disneyfication））。,The result is that the diverse postmodern buildings of the contemporary city present a shallow facade of culture (sometimes termed Disneyfication).
6450,非概率抽样包括就近抽样、目标式抽样、滚雪球抽样和专家抽样。,"Non-probability sampling includes convenience, purposive, snowball sampling and expert sampling."
6450,概率抽样包括简单随机抽样（抽签方法、名称方法、出生日期或电脑生成方法）、系统抽样、分层抽样和多阶整群抽样。,"Non-probability sampling includes simple random sampling (lottery method, first name, date of birth or computer-generated methods), stratified sampling, cluster sampling and multi-stage sampling."
6450,另外还有配额抽样，属于准随机抽样的方法。,"Quota sampling, a quasi-random sampling method, is also used."
6451,从结构化访谈到非结构化访谈，访谈类型各有不同。,"There are various types of interviews, ranging from structured interviews to unstructured interviews."
6451,表6-2概述了不同类型访谈的区别。,Table 6.2 outlines the differences between the types of interviews.
6451,每种类型的访谈都有其独特的本体论、认识论和方法论，本章讨论了两种侧重定性方法的访谈：非结构化访谈（或深度访谈）及半结构化访谈。,"Each type of interview has its own particular ontological, epistemological and methodological position.This chapter discusses the two qualitative-oriented types of interviews: unstructured interviews (or depth or in-depth interviews) and semi-structured interviews."
6452,在随机抽样中，研究者可以使用多种表格来帮助决定样本容量。,There are various tables available to researchers to assist in decision making regarding sample size in probability samples.
6452,本章后边罗列了一些这样的表格。随机抽样方法较多，包括：简单随机抽样（simplerandom sampling）、系统抽样（systematic sampling）、分层随机抽样（stratified random sampling）和多阶整群抽样（multistage cluster sampling）。,"Examples of such tables are presented later in the chapter.There are a number of random sampling approaches: simple random sampling, systematic sampling, stratified random sampling and multistage cluster sampling."
6453,对旅游者（或旅行者）进行分类的理论已非常之多。,
6453,,A plethora of typologies exist that describe the range of tourist and/or traveller types.
6453,这些理论主要有两种模式：互动模式和认知标准化模式(Murphy 1985)。,There are interactive models and the cognitive-normative models (Murphy 1985).
6453,互动模式的理论包括：库恩(1972)关于旅游体验和旅游角色类型的四分法——有组织的大众旅游者、无组织的大众旅游者、探险家和流浪者；史密斯（1978)的七分法——探险家、精英、非传统旅游者、非常规旅游者、初级大众旅游者、大众旅游者和包租旅游者；皮尔斯（1982)对旅行者的十五分法——旅游者、旅行者、休假者、飞机旅行者、商人（原文如此）、移民、环保主义者、探险家、传教士、留学生、人类学家、嬉皮士、国际运动员、驻海外记者和宗教朝圣者。,"Examples of interactive models include: Cohen's (1972) fourfold typology of tourist experiences and roles — the organised mass tourist, the individualised mass tourist, the explorer and the drifter; Smith's (1978) sevenfold classification including the explorer, elite, off- beat, unusual, incipient mass, mass and charter tourist; and Pearce's (1982) 15 traveller types — tourist, traveller, holiday maker, jetsetter, businessman [sic], migrant, conservationist, explorer, missionary, overseas student, anthropologist, hippie, international athlete, overseas journalist and religious pilgrim."
6454,如格伦德曼抱怨的那样，马克思有时会认为，当“生产力导向一种不断增加的不确定性、风险和不可控性以及生产过程中不必要的压迫”时，生产力的发展意味着一种不断增长的支配自然的力量。,"As Grundmann complains, Marx, at times, seems to assume that growth of productive forces implies an increasing power to dominate nature, when ""there may be productive forces which do not lead"" in that direction ""but, rather, to an increasing uncertainty, risk, and uncontrollability as well as to unnecessary oppression in the production process."""
6454,这并非暗示对自然环境的关注同普罗米修斯式观点是不相容的。,This does not imply that concern for the natural environment is incompatible with a Promethean view.
6454,实际上，“人类中心主义和对自然的奴役，非但没有引起生态难题，反而是处理这些难题的出发点”。,"Indeed, ""anthropocentrism and mastery over nature, far from causing ecological problems, are the starting-points from which to address them."""
6455,电话调査主要是结构式访谈，采用封闭式问题。访问者使用电话技术与受访者交流，并记录答案。,"Telephone surveys are primarily structured interviews using closed questions, with an interviewer recording the respondent's answers.Contact with respondents is made using telephone technology."
6455,计算机技术将进一步协助电话技术，在这种情况下，使用软件程序可以迅速记录应答，同时通过分析程序整合应答。,"Telephone technology may be further assisted by computer technology, in which case the responses are immediately recorded using software programs that integrate the responses with analysis procedures."
6456,封闭式问题有四种不同的测量层次：定类、定序、定距及定比层次。,"Closed-ended questions are measured at different levels: nominal, ordinal,interval and ratio levels."
6456,定类测量法使用词语或名词来对答案选项加以分类（前文有关对照表的例子和紧跟其后的行业透视展现了定类测量法）。,The nominal measure is associated with the use of words or nouns to classify response sets (nominal measures were presented in the checklist on page 249 and in the Industry Insight opposite).
6456,它通常使用“其他”选项，以此保证包括所有的类别。,Nominal measures usually include the use of 'other' to ensure all categories have been included.
6457,在封面上应该写明报告的标题、作者（们）的姓名及研究主持单位。,"On the cover, you should identify the title of the report, the author (s) andthe host institution."
6457,以上是封面的一般标准格式。当然，也可以根据委托人的不同要求采用不同的格式。,"Generally, this is the norm for covers; however, clients may have different requirements by which you must abide."
6458,(5)制度是生产出来的多少具有持久性空间。,5. Institutions are produced spaces of a more or less durable sort.
6458,在最显见的意义上，它们是领土化-控制和监禁的领地、管辖的地形、组织和管理的领域。,"In the most obvious sense they are territorialization — territories of control and surveillance, terrains of jurisdiction, and domains of organization and administration."
6458,但是，它们亦带来了象征空间的组织化(纪念碑、圣地、围墙、大门、房屋的内部空间)和符号体系的空间控制，这些东西支撑和指导着各种形式的制度实践和忠诚。,"But they also entail the organization of symbolic spaces (monuments, shrines, walls, gates, interior spaces of the house) and the spatial orchestration of semiotic systems that support and guide all manner of institutional practices and allegiances."
6458,对象征空间秩序的干预以及学习解读制度化景观的语言学，这是权力作用于个体的结果，这种结果在保障社会秩序方面具有主要的作用。,Insertion into the symbolic spatial order and learning to read the semiotics of institutionalized landscapes is an effect of power upon the individual that has a primary role in guaranteeing subservience to the social order.
6459,混沌理论被认为是一种显范式（与女性主义视角和后现代主义相似），尤其是在旅游调查中。,"Chaos theory can also be classified as an emergent paradigm (like feminist perspectives and postmodernism), particularly within tourism inquiry."
6459,然而，混沌理论很快就遭到了复杂理论的挑战。,"However, chaos theory is very quickly being challenged by complexity theory."
6459,两者都起源于自然科学、数学和人工智能等领域。,
6460,在进行假设检验的过程中，通常至少涉及两个变量——自变量和因变量。,"If you are testing a hypothesis, there will be at least two variables —an independent variable and a dependent variable."
6460,"实际上，“定量研究的语言就是变量以及变量间关系的语言”（Neuman 2000, p.126)。","In fact, 'the language of quantitative research is a language of variables and relationships among variables' (Neuman 2000, p. 126)."
6460,自变量有时也被称为原因变量（Neuman 2000)或改变变量（Kumar 1996)。,The independent variable is sometimes referred to as the causal variable (Neuman 2000) or change variable (Kumar 1996).
6460,因变量也可称为结果变量（Kumar 1996)。,The dependent variable is also referred to as the outcome variable (Kumar 1996).
6461,案例研究的优点有：结果通过三角校正和成员间相互核对而产生，且研究结果所依据的是被研究的整个旅游环境。,"The advantages of case studies include that the findings are generated through the use of methodological triangulation and member checking, and the findings are grounded in the tourism setting being studied."
6461,缺点是研究者缺乏客观性，研究结果不能够进一步概化，也可能存在研究者偏误。,"The disadvantages arise from the lack of objectivity of the researcher, the lack of generalisability of the findings and the possibility of researcher bias."
6461,另外，案例研究还较为耗时。,"In addition, case studies are time-consuming."
6462,自然科学的题材常常局限在实验室中，从而，就有一种提出此类问题的传统，即如果已知的方法既可用在这样的背景下，又能够提供答案，则这些问题是可以回答的。,"In the physical sciences, the subject-matter can often be controlled in the laboratory, and accordingly there is a tradition of posing questions which are answerable, given the methods known to be both available in such a context, and capable of providing answers."
6462,因此，科学真正成功的部分取决于其提出“好问题”(反对“坏问题”)的特有传统。,Part of the very success of science therefore lies in its characteristic tradition of asking ‘well-posed’ (as opposed to ‘ill-posed’) questions.
6462,从概率论应用中可以找到这样的例子。,An example of this can be drawn from an application of probability theory.
6463,自然的改变——例如， 通过培植景观而产生的自然人性化——成为一种优先的手段，不仅可以重新获得似乎在其他地方失去的东西，而且可以为人类定义未来。在那种未来中，只有通过解放人类的感觉使之达及崇高和超验的存在经验，自我实现才能完成。,"The transformation of nature — its humanization through landscape gardening, for example — became one privileged means of not only regaining what seemed to be lost elsewhere, but of defining a future for humanity in which self-realization could only be achieved by liberating the human senses to the sublime and transcendental experience of being at one with the world."
6463,但是，如果感觉的解放通过美学而成为启蒙规划至关重要的方面，那么结果就不只是伊格尔顿所称的“通过感觉生活而发生的大规模的抽象理性内投”，而且产生了对理性自身起源的内部对立：,"But if the liberation of the senses became a crucial aspect of the Enlightenment project through the rise of esthetics, then the effect was not only to achieve what Eagleton (1990: 42, 49) calls ""a massive introjection of abstract reason by the life of the senses"" but to produce an internal opposition to the very provenance of reason itself:"
6464,她非常珍惜能够自己赚钱的机会，在贫民窟外的一个中产阶级家庭里担任女管家（这座贫民窟就围绕在内罗毕主要的高尔夫球场外围）。,She relished the chance to earn her own money and went to work as a housekeeper in one of the middle-class houses outside the slum (which is wrapped around Nairobi’s main golf course).
6464,往后几年，她得以把孩子一起接过来。现在，尽管城市里有许多暴力掠夺的现象，他们还是决定在这里扎根发展。,"Over the next few years, she was able to bring her children, and now they are determined to make the city their home and their future, despite its many depredations."
6465,事实上，最大的威胁来自一条高速公路(expressway)，它要斜穿过这个市场。在市政厅里似乎没有人关心这件事。,"Nobody has encouraged it.The biggest threat, in fact, is the expressway which will cut diagonally across.Nobody at City Hall seems at all concerned about it."
6465,我希望炒一炒这件事，让大家投点注意力……,I hope to stir up some interest.. .
6466,"不同层次和种类的抽象之间的张力即个体为了理解他们与世界的关系而必然诉诸的那种张力,在他的小说中特别生动，常常被内化到主角的冲突情感之中。","This tension between the different levels and kinds of abstractions to which individuals necessarily appeal in order to understand their relation to the world, is particularly vivid in his novels, often internalized within the conflicting emotions of the protagonists."
6466,在《边远的乡村》中，马太在更大的世界中叫他父亲取的名字，但是在格林玛威，他总是被称为威尔。,"In Border Country, Matthew takes the name given by his father into the wider world, but in Glynmawr he is always known as Will, the name his mother wanted."
6466,这种身份的双重性——他到底是马太还是威尔呢?,"The duality of that identity — who is he, Matthew or Will?"
6466,——贯穿于整部小说。,— is perpetually at work throughout the novel.
6467,这个问题同对理性/非理性的探讨紧紧地联系在一起。,This question was tightly coupled with considerations of rationality/ irrationality.
6467,法兰克福学派挑战了工具理性的霸权，并且寻求一种替代性理性，这种理性有能力赋予生活一种深刻的意义，有能力恢复人类与外部自然之间敏感而开放的辩证关系，而不会向浪漫主义愤怒，宗教意识形态、自然崇拜和邪恶神话之盲目力量屈服。,"The Frankfurt School challenged the hegemony of instrumental rationality and sought in its place an alternative rationality that had the power to give a deeper sense of meaning to life, to recuperate a sensuous and open dialogical relation between human beings and external nature without giving in to what they saw as the blind forces of romantic fury, religious ideology, nature idolatory and satanic myth."
6467,当然，如何做到这一点仍然是一个未决的问题。,"How to do that is still, of course, a very open question."
6468,尽管传统和现代部门使用同样的生产要素，但要素报酬并不相同。,"Although the same factor of production is used in the traditional and modern sectors, it is not paid the same wage."
6468,劳动从传统部门转移到现代部门，工资必然会上升。,Labor must be paid a premium to move from traditional to modern employment.
6468,用W>1表示工人在现代部门得到的工资率与在传统部门得到的工资率之比。,Let w › 1 be the ratio of the wage rate that must be paid in the modern sector to that in the traditional sector.
6469,种族歧视有两种形式：就业歧视和工资歧视。,Racial discrimination takes two forms: employment discrimination and wage discrimination.
6469,就业歧视指，尽管实际上：两类人具有同等的生产能力并且被支付等量的工资，但雇主仍有组织地雇用某一类人超过另一类人的行为。,"Employment discrimination refers to the practice of systematically hiring one group over the other, despite the fact that both groups are equally productive and are paid the same wage."
6469,工资歧视指，对具有同等生产能力的工人支付不同工资的行为。,Wage discrimination refers to the practice of paying different wages to equally productive workers.
6470,人行道生活的社会结构部分地依赖于那些可谓自我任命的公共人物(public characters)。,The social structure of sidewalk life hangs partly on what can be called self-appointed public characters.
6470,公共人物是经常与众多人群接触的人，而且对于做公共人物有着足够的兴趣。要成为一位公共人物用不着特殊的才能和智慧——尽管有很多公共人物都颇具才能和智慧。,A public character is anyone who is in frequent contact with a wide circle of people and who is sufficiently interested to make himself a public character.A public character need have no special talents or wisdom to fulfill his function---although he often does.
6471,市民的概念因此一直被扩大了，不仅包括获得利益的资格，而且还包括以自力更生和有偿工作为目的的相互义务。,The notion of citizenship has therefore been expanded beyond the realm of entitlements to benefits to include reciprocal obligations to aim for self-reliance and paid work.
6471,正在整个西方世界传播的这一战略与“工作利益”的概念相联系，这将在第十三章中有更详细的讨论。,"This strategy, which is spreading throughout the Western world, is bound up with notions of  ‘workfare’ that are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 13."
6471,愤世嫉俗的人会说这种市民身份的定义只是为了通过强迫不适合者去就业以减少福利预算而已。,Cynics would argue that this new version of citizenship is simply a way of saving welfare budgets by coercing unsuitable people into employment.
6471,但是不管怎样，关于社会排斥的新焦点认识到，市民身份涉及的不仅仅是物质方面的因素，而且还包括归属感和民主政治权利的问题。,"Nevertheless, the new focus on social exclusion recognizes that citizenship involves more than just material factors and also includes senses of belonging and democratic empowerment."
6472,当我们把有关“自然”和“自然的”话语看成社会过程的环节，它们就不那么令人困惑了。在那些社会过程中，社会权力的冲突形式出于特殊目的而努力获得对制度、社会关系和物质实践的控制。,"Discourses about ""nature"" and the ""natural"" become less confusing when taken as moments in a social process in which conflicting forms of social power struggle to gain command of institutions, social relations and material practices for particular purposes."
6472,这并不必然暗示，统治的权力结构只推广一种话语而压抑另一种话语(尽管依附于公司资本主义和现代国家的占统治地位的功利主义与普罗米修斯主义—被实用主义的马尔萨斯主义所修正—几乎毋庸置疑）。,This is not necessarily to suggest that dominant power structures promote one and only one discourse rather than another (though the dominant utilitarianism and Prometheanism — modified by a dose of convenient Malthusianism — that attaches to corporate capitalism and the modern state is hardly in doubt).
6473,一些功能中心是在活跃的、多样化的地区里形成的，就像公园中的功能中心是在小规模的范围内产生的。如果这些中心同时还能拥有一个象征这个地区的地标或标志性建筑，那么就能成为这些地区的标志。,"Centers of use grow up in lively, diverse districts, just as centers of use occur on a smaller scale in parks, and such centers count especially in district identification if they contain also a landmark that comes to stand for the place symbolically and, in a way, for the disrrict."
6473,但是，中心不能单靠自己来承担代表地区的标志作用。不同的商业和文化设施以及不同的景观都会在这个地区里接二连三地冒出来。,"But centers cannot carry the load of district identification by themselves; differing commercial and cultural facilities, and different-looking scenes, must crop up all through."
6473,在这种情况下，一些具体的障碍，如宽广的交通干道，很大的公园、庞大的办公机构楼群等都会在功能上产生破坏性的作用，因为它们阻碍了交叉使用。,"Within this fabric, physical barriers, such as huge traffic arteries, too large parks, big institutional groupings, are functionally destructive because they block cross-use."
6474,你过去怎样看待共产主义，你现在怎样看待自然，只不过是投你所好东西。,"What you thought about communism, what you now think about nature, is no more than a projection of what suited you."
6474,对其他人来说，每一信仰都是真实的，这个事实只不过让你来欺骗他们。,The fact that for others each belief is substantial merely enabled you to deceive them.
6474,(Loyalties，364),"(Loyalties, p. 364)"
6475,个人商品，如热狗，只能被一个人消费。,A private good (a hot dog) can be consumed by only one person.
6475,相反，某公共产品可同时供许多人消费。,"In contrast, a pubic good can be consumed by many people at the same time."
6475,例如，成百上千的公民可以在互不干扰的情况下观赏游行，所以该游行属于共同消费品（joint consumption）：每个人可消费同一产品。,"For example, hundreds of people can watch a parade without interfering with each others' enjoyment of the parade.In other words, a parade is subject to joint consumption: everyone can consume the same good."
6476,在思考经济发展的理论和实践问题时，关联效应是最容易引起困惑的思想之一。,The idea of linkages is one of the greatest sources of confusion in thinking about both the theory of  development and development in practice.
6476,赫希曼（1958）引入了这一术语，并把它作为新鲜事物介绍给大家。,Hirschman (1958) introduced the term and presented it as something quite new.
6476,后来的评论者们接受了他的观念。,Later commentators have taken him at his word.
6476,"因此，李特尔（Little, 1982）认为因为其他学者已在某种程度上探究过（可能有些混乱）金融外部经济可能的作用，赫希曼的关联效应概念肯定包含了一个非金融的因素。","Thus Little (1982) insists that since other authors  had already explored at some length (if with some confusion) the possible role of pecuniary external economies, Hirschman's linkage concept must have crucially involved a nonpecuniary element."
6477,工业城市之所以发展是因为满足了两个条件。,The factory city develops because two conditions are satisfied.
6477,首先，农业工人（小麦种植者）的生产力足够高，他们生产的小麦 不仅能满足他们自身的需要，而且还有剩余，能满足城市中毛纺工业工人的需要。,"First, the productivity of agricultural workers (wheat growers) is high enough that they can feed themselves and have enough left over to feed the cloth workers in the city."
6477,换句话说，农业剩余养活了城市工人。,"In other words, the agricultural surplus feeds city workers."
6477,第二，规模经济相对于交通费用而言足够大，毛纺厂的毛料生产价格低于家庭生产的价格。,"Second, scale economies are large relative to travel costs, so the cloth factory can underprice homemade cloth."
6478,福特式体制中利润的决定性因素是成本的控制，尤其是劳动力成本的控制。,"Crucial to profitability in the Fordist system was control of costs, especially those of labour."
6478,但是，一般认为，工厂之间的竞争越来越多地依靠诸如可信度、经营风格和创新等因素，而对成本的依赖性大幅度减少。,"However, it is argued that firms compete less on the basis of cost and increasingly on the basis of factors such as reliability, style and innovation."
6478,因此，研发、产品创新和市场营销在后福特主义社会开始变得越来越重要。,"Research and development, product innovation and marketing have therefore become much more important in a neo-Fordist society."
6478,在福特主义下，成本还可以利用内部规模经济（internal economies of scale) 来减少。,"Under Fordism, costs were also reduced by taking advantage of internal economies of scale."
6478,这些因素使得制造一种产品的平均成本下降到等同于输出增加的水平。,These are factors that decrease the average cost of manufacturing a product as the level of output increases.
6478,由于专业化机器的高初始成木，在福特主义下是通过产品的大量输出而获得巨额利润的。,"Because of the high start-up costs of specialized machinery, it took high volumes of output to make big profits under Fordism."
6479,一方面，回到作为全部经验源泉(包括时间和空间源泉）的身体成为挑战整个抽象网络(科学的、社会的、政治经济的网络）的手段(在今天越来越具有优先地位），借助于那些网络，社会关系、权力关系、制度和物质实践得以定义、再现和调节。,"On the one hand, to return to the human body as the fount of all experience (including that of space and time) becomes a means (increasingly privileged in these times) to challenge the whole network of abstractions (scientific, social, political—economic) through which social relations, power relations, institutions, and material practices get defined, represented, and regulated."
6479,另一方面，人类身体能脱离不在时空规定的社会过程。,"But on the other hand, no human body is outside of the social processes of determination of space—time."
6479,回到身体或许证实了那些据说正受到反抗的社会过程的时间和空间。,To return to it may well be to instanciate the space and time of the very social processes being purportedly rebelled against.
6479,例如，如果工人被转化为资本的附属物(如马克思在《资本论》中阐明的），无论是在工厂还是在消费领域( 或者，如福柯更喜欢说的那样，由于18 世纪以来强有力的规训机构的兴起，身体被改造成温驯的身体），那么他们的身体又如何能够脱离资本循环或者各种规训他们的机器，而成为万物之尺度呢？,"If, for example, workers are transformed (as Marx suggests in Capital) into appendages of capital in both the workplace and the consumption sphere (or, as Foucault prefers it, bodies are made over into docile bodies by the rise of a powerful disciplinary apparatus from the eighteenth century on) then how can their bodies be a measure of anything outside of the circulation of capital or of the various mechanisms that discipline them?"
6480,"滚雪球抽样还有其他一些名称，如连环引介、名声或网络抽样(Newman 2000, p. 199)或根莲抽样(Stehlik 1999)。","Snowballing sampling has several other names — chain referral , reputational or network sampling (Neuman 2000 , p . 199 ) or rhizome sampling (Stehlik 1999) ."
6480,滚雪球抽样适合于难以找到参与者的时候，因为研究者可能没有正式的或非正式的“网络联系”。,Snowball sampling is used with difficult to reach participants because the researcher may not be informed about formal or informal 'net work connections' .
6480,一旦研究人员发现了总体中的一个研究对象，其他的成员就会通过顺藤换瓜的方式被发现，直到找到全部参与者。,"Once the researcher has identified one member of the population, other members are identified by this member and then by the next participants contacted until all the participants have been contacted."
6481,奈斯，深度生态学的领军人物，他坚持一种相关的答案：“人并非环境之中的一个物，而是时空中没有规定边界的相关系统中的一个接合点”（Naese，1989:79）。,"Naess (1989: 79), the leading figure in deep ecology, insists on a relational answer: ""a human being is not a thing in an environment, but a juncture in a relational system without determined boundaries in time and space."""
6481,这是一个极为重要的定义，与我的全部论证都有重要关系。,This is an extremely important definition that has a significant bearing on my whole argument.
6481,首先，它注意到怀特海的过程哲学、内部关系的辩证概念(参阅本书第二章)，并且特别融合了这种观点，即“整体和部分是内在相关的”（Naese，1989:59）。,"To begin with, it picks up on the process philosophy of Whitehead and the dialectical conceptions of internal relations (see chapter 2) and specifically incorporates the view that ""whole and part are internally related"" (Naess, 1989: 59)."
6482,如奥尔曼指出的那样，对现象多样性和相关性的理解，其目标是识别极少的基本过程，这些过程使现象形成统一性同时又使它们区分开来。,"The purpose of multiple and relational approaches to phenomena is, as Oilman points out in his commentary on this passage, to try to identify a restricted number of very general underlying processes which simultaneously unify and differentiate the phenomena we see in the world around us."
6482,这也正是怀特海关注的焦点。,This was very much the focus of Whitehead's concerns.
6482,在这一意义上，辩证法就是要寻求一条通往某种本体论安全或还原主义的道路——不是把什么东西都还原为“物”而是还原为普通的生成过程和关系。,"In this sense, dialectics does seek a path towards a certain kind of ontological security, or reductionism — not a reductionism to ""things"" but to an understanding of common generative processes and relations."
6483,特殊的坡度形式(山坡刻面)和一定的土壤与植被(生态系统)类型相联系，而这种联系又反过来决定了土地利用活动，形成生境/生态系统类型图的一种形式。,"Particular types of slope form (slope facets) were linked to certain soil and vegetation (ecosystem) types and these in turn determined land-use activity, resulting in a form of habitat/ecosystem-type mapping."
6483,近来沃伦(Warren，2001)提倡在研究谷坡过程时重新评价这些思想，为保育管理提供理论基础。,Warren (2001) called for a re-evaluation of these ideas in relation to valley-side slope processes to provide a basis for conservation management.
6483,"如今航空摄影、遥感、GIS和数字化地形模型是这类评价不可缺少的部分，不过地形类型或山坡刻面之间界限的勾绘问题仍然是研究的重点(Townshend, 1981; Barrough and Frank, 1996; Barrough and MeDonell, 1998)。","Aerial photography, remote sensing, GIS and digital terrain modelling are now an essential part of such evaluation and yet again problems of boundary delimitation between different terrain types or slope facets represent a major research focus for the subject (Townshend, 1981; Burrough and Frank, 1996; Burrough and McDonnell, 1998)."
6484,合成理论（compositional theory)是从芝加哥决定论派生出的另一学派之产物。,Compositional theory is the product of another school of thought that has developed out of the writings of the Chicago determinists.
6484,合成论者强调，不同社会群体的凝聚是基于民族、亲缘、邻居、职业或者生活方式，而这种社会网络并不会被城市生活削弱。,"Compositionalists emphasize the cohesion and intimacy of distinctive social worlds based on ethnicity, kinship, neighbourhood, occupation or lifestyle, rejecting the idea that these social networks are in any way diminished by urban life (e.g."
6484,他们同时也认为，人类行为受城市生活的心理影响极小，它基本上是由经济地位、文化特征和家庭地位等决定的，而这些因素也决定了人们从属于哪个社会群体。,"Gans, 1962).They also minimize the psychological effects of city life on people’s behaviour, suggesting, instead, that behaviour is determined largely by economic status, cultural characteristics, family status and so on: the same attributes that determine which social worlds they live in."
6485,确实，每一个卓越的理论家都倾向诉诸一种特殊的“永恒”(环节) 结构，把各种“环节”之间的关系固定下来，从而使社会获得结构化秩序。,"Each major theorist, it is true, tends to appeal to a particular structure of permanences"" (elements) that transfix relations between the various moments"" to give a structured order to a society."
6485,常常会出现这种情况：使这种或那种环节具有优先地位，成为社会变迁的核心。,
6485,,And there is often some sort of privileging of one or other moment as the locus of social change.
6485,这样一种结构化的系统似乎把社会过程囚禁在再生产的循环因果关系的铁笼之中(如马克思的“资本的逻辑”、韦伯的“官僚制的-技术的合理性”，或者斯潘德的“语言的牢笼”)。,"Such a structured system seems to imprison the social process in an iron cage of reproductive circular causality (such as Marx's ""logic of capital,"" Weber's ""bureaucratic—technocratic rationality"" or Spender's ""prisonhouse of language"")."
6486,统一的地理学分化为自然地理学和人文地理学，导致了W.威廉-奥尔森与卡尔•汉纳伯格（Carl D. Hannerberg）之间关于人文地理学的争论。W.,The division of institutional geography into physical and human branches led to a debate between W. William-Olsson and Carl D. Hannerberg concerning human geography.
6486,威廉-奥尔森支持传统的全局的视角，而汉纳伯格则认为地理学是专门学科的综合体。,"W. William-Olsson argued for a traditional holistic view, while Hannerberg explained the field as a complex of special disciplines."
6486,当时，乌普萨拉大学的森德伯格（A.Sundborg）正在进行河流变化过程的实验工作。,At this time A. Sundborg at Uppsala was undertaking experimental work on fluvial processes.
6487,当然，随着时间的推移，经济学已越来越数学化了。,"Economics has, of course, become vastly more mathematical over time."
6487,不管怎么说，即使在那个时代发展经济学的风格也很落伍。,"Nonetheless, development economics was archaic in style even for its own time."
6487,在超发展理论最著名的四篇论文中，罗森斯坦一罗丹的那篇文章基本上与萨缪尔森 （Samuelson）将赫克歇尔一俄林理论模型化的工作属于同一时期，而刘易斯、缪尔达尔和赫希曼的文章几乎与索罗对增长理论的最初论述同时问世。,"Of the four most famous high development works, Rosenstein-Rodan's was approximately contemporary with Samuelson's formulation of the Heckscher-Ohlin model, while Lewis, Myrdal,and Hirschman were all roughly contemporary with Solow's initial statement of growth theory."
6488,上千人一次又一次回来再看。我们认识的一个人说他遇到了一批黑人（negro）小孩，他们告诉他已看了五次《罗密欧与朱丽叶》。许许多多迷上了艺术的人的生活视野被扩大了，生活内容大大丰富了；具有同样感觉的还有美国未来戏剧的观众们。,Hundreds came back again and again; a fellow weknow says he met a group of Negro children who told him they had been to Romeo and Juliet five times.The lives of a lot of these converts have been enlarged and enriched;so has the audience for the American theater of the future.
6489,这需要“培训前（before）”和“培训后（after）”资料的收集（用于前测和后测的两组不同资料），以确定培训计划是否有实际效果。,There needs to be a 'before' and 'after' set of data collected (that is pre- and post-test/data sets) in order to determine if any change has occurred as a result of the training program.
6489,最后，研究者可能想要用历时数年收集的资料来确定或预测未来的游览方式（预测性的研究）。,"Finally, the researcher may wish to draw on data that has been collected over a period of years to determine or forecast future visitation patterns (predictive research)."
6489,研究方法因此也可能具有某种时间上的性质：之前的、之后的；过去的、现在的或将来的资料收集需求。,"Subsequently, approaches to research can also have a temporal nature, pre- or post-, or past, present and future data collection requirements."
6490,我们的“全球化”时间主要特征之一是我们对强烈的社会转变非常自信。,One of the prime characteristics of our ‘globalizing’ times is that we are very self-conscious of intensive social change.
6490,人文地理学和社会科学文献都被新事物所充斥。,The human geography and social sciences literatures are awash with descriptions of things being new.
6490,许多宣告最近的往昔正在消逝的新词汇表明了这一点:后殖民主义、后工业主义、后福特主义、后发展、后马克思主义、后结构主义等，当然，最常见的还有后现代主义。,"This is indicated by the many terms that proclaim the passing of a recent past: postcolonialism, post- industrialism, postFordism, postdevelopment, post-Marxism, post-structuralism and, of course, postmodernism are most common."
6491,对于后现代主义和后结构主义理解社会正义所陷入的僵局，存在着大量不满的迹象。,There are abundant signs of discontent with the impasse into which post-modernism's and poststructuralisms approach to the question of social justice has fallen.
6491,并且出现了许多不同的策略，试图恢复关于正义论证的动员力量。它们不是诉诸有限但却普遍的原则，就是更加雄心勃勃地试图在所谓现代主义的普遍主义和后结构主义的解构所产生的分裂的特殊性之间建造一座桥梁。,"And a number of different strategies have emerged to try to resurrect the mobilizing power of arguments about justice in ways which either permit appeal to carefully circumscribed, but nevertheless general, principles or which, more ambitiously, try to build a bridge between the supposed universalisms of modernism and the fragmented particularities left behind by post structuralist deconstruction."
6492,我们的“全球化”时间主要特征之一是我们对强烈的社会转变非常自信。,One of the prime characteristics of our ‘globalizing’ times is that we are very self-conscious of intensive social change.
6492,人文地理学和社会科学文献都被新事物所充斥。,The human geography and social sciences literatures are awash with descriptions of things being new.
6492,许多宣告最近的往昔正在消逝的新词汇表明了这一点：后殖民主义、后工业主义、后福特主义、后发展、后马克思主义、后结构主义等，当然，最常见的还有后现代主义。,"This is indicated by the many terms that proclaim the passing of a recent past: postcolonialism, post-industrialism, postFordism, postdevelopment, post-Marxism, post-structuralism and, of course, postmodernism are most common."
6493,当从工业生产技术到市中心的每一种事物成为主要的关注课题，在这样的时代里，(社群生活、技能和生活方式等方面的)创造性破坏、不断增长的碎片化、瞬间化等等主题已经越来越显著地出现在文化和哲学话语中。,"Themes of creative destruction, of increased fragmentation, of ephemerality (in community life, of skills, of lifestyles) have become much more noticeable in literary and philosophic discourse in an era when restructuring of everything from industrial production techniques to inner cities has become a major topic of concern."
6493,通往后现代主义预示的“感觉结构”的转型，与近二十多年中发生的政治经济实践转变有着密切的联系。,"The transformation in ""the structure of feeling"" which the move towards postmodernism betokens has much to do with the shifts in political-economic practices that have occurred over the last two decades."
6493,它似乎特别折射出交流手段非物质化的方式。,It seems to refract in particular the way in which means of communication have been dematerialized.
6494,与女性主义范式相同，在使用后现代主义范式这个术语时应当注意，这个术语是一个统称。,"Therefore, as was the case of the feminist perspectives paradigm, you need to be aware that in using the term postmodern paradigm, the term is used generically."
6494,之所以使用这个统称性的术语，是因为正如后现代主义自己所宣称的那样，不存在什么真正唯一的后现代主义理论，后现代主义的定义也不止一个。,"It is generically applied because as postmodern positions assert, there is no one truth and no one definition of postmodernism."
6494,相反，存在着“很多种后现代主义理论和立场”（Kellner 1990，P.257）。,"Instead, there is a 'plurality of different postmodern theories and positions' (Kellner 1990, p. 257)."
6495,幻觉的虚拟世界的建设者们的话语充斥着想象的身体形象，摆脱了肉体强加的限制。,"The discourse of visionary virtual world builders is rife with images of imaginal bodies, freed from the constraints that flesh imposes."
6495,赛伯空间的开发者预见了他们能够忘记身体的一种时间。,Cyberspace developers foresee a time when they will be able to forget about the body.
6495,（Stone， 1991：107—113),"(Stone, 1991: 107-13)."
6496,后结构主义（poststructuralist)方法分享了很多根本方法的假设。总之，它强烈反对将世界解释为像基于阶级冲突这样单一的、隐含的、根本的结构的观点。,"Poststructuralist approaches are strongly opposed to the idea that the world can be explained by a single, hidden, underlying structure, such as class-based conflict."
6496,相反，它认为社会中存在不平等的大量变数和维度。,"Instead, it is argued that there are numerous shifting and unstable dimensions of inequality in society."
6496,此外，它还认为这些不平等在各种表现形式中得到了反映，这些形式包括语言、知识理论（intellectual theories)、广告、流行音乐和城市景观。,"In addition, it is argued that these inequalities are reflected in various forms of representation, including language, intellectual theories, advertising, popular music and city landscapes."
6496,所有这些表现形式都包含一组共有的意义——我们称之为话语（discourses)。,All of these forms of representation involve sets of shared meanings --- what are called discourses.
6497,但是，对自然的统治和对他者的统治之间的这种联系还有更多的维度。,But this connection between the domination of nature and the domination of others has a further dimension.
6497,任何种类的“改造自然”计划都具有分布性后果，许多此类明显不公正研究都是急烈冲突的根源。,"""Nature-transforming"" projects of any sort have distributional consequences and the patent inequity of many of these has been the source of powerful conflicts."
6497,当前，在环境正义运动和名为“穷人的环境保护主义” 运动的多国组织中，这些都成为斗争的焦点(参阅本书第十三章)。,"These are now the focus of struggle in the environmental justice movement and within a polyglot group of movements known as ""the environmentalism of the poor"" (see chapter 13)."
6498,这些可憎的思想反映了一种占优势的正统，但同时也激起了热烈的辩论。,Such distasteful ideas reflected a prevailing orthodoxy but they also provoked spirited debate.
6498,尽管环境决定论和科学种族主义常常互相强化，但也可能互相矛盾。,"While environmental determinism and scientific racism were often mutually reinforcing ideas, they could also contradict one another."
6498,有些种族论者假定，各“种族”均被固定在一个不变的“天然”级序，这个级序就是从不同起点出发的截然不同的发育系列中当前的表现(多元发生论)。,"Some racial theorists assumed that different ‘races’ were fixed in an unchanging ‘natural’ hierarchy, the contemporary manifestation of quite distinct evolutionary sequences from different points of departure (polygenesis)."
6499,这个框架的核心就是环境控制（environmental conditioning）作用。,Central to this whole perspective is the idea of environmental conditioning.
6499,纽森在婴儿护理模式的论述中提供了经典的例子：贫困邻里的特征直接表现为贫穷的外观、拥挤的环境，以及抚养孩子的愚昧态度。,"A classic example is provided by Newson and Newson’s (1965) work on patterns of infant care.Impoverished neighbourhoods, they argued, are characterized by a poverty of sensory stimulation, by crowded environments that inhibit play, and by unenlightened attitudes towards child rearing."
6499,结果，这种环境下的孩子经过环境的作用成长为难以社会化的个体，他们倾向于融入离自己生活很近的社会群体，而无法应对其生活之外的各种竞争。,"The net result, they concluded, is that the environmental conditioning experienced by children growing up in such settings produces ‘under-socialized’ individuals with a competitive nature attuned only to the immediate social group, leaving them ill-equipped to cope with the more subtle forms of competition that prevail in the world beyond."
6500,8.,8.
6500,7.2社会和环境影响评估法使用定量研究方法能够评估社会和环境影响。,7.2 Social and environmental impact assessmentsBoth social and environmental impact assessments can be determined using a quantitative methodology.
6500,主要的数据收集方法包括观察法、调査法、历时研究法、案例研究、德尔菲法、文献或档案法、预测法、实验和准实验法。,"The chief methods of data collection include observation, surveys, longitudinal studies, case studies, the Delphic method, the documentary or archival method, forecasting and experimental and quasiexperimental methods."
6500,这些方法的优缺点已经在本章中的其他部分讨论过，但是在此再次提及有关定量研究方法论的优缺点是很有用的。,"The advantages and disadvantages of each of these methods have been discussed elsewhere in the chapter, but it useful to note here the advantages and disadvantages of the overriding methodology."
6501,20世纪中叶环境变化与历史断代方法的结合大放光彩，那时发明、发展、改进了这种技术并应用于环境重建。,"The coupling of environmental change and historical dating methods flowered in the middle of the twentieth century when techniques were invented, developed, improved and applied to environmental reconstruction."
6501,"这些技术中最重要的是放射性碳（Libby, 1955)和氧同位素温度估测与断代(Shackleton，1977)。","Among the most important of these were radiocarbon dating (Libby, 1955) and oxygen-isotope temperature estimations and dating (Shackleton, 1977)."
6501,这些方面阐明了哈里（Harré，1969)的论点:科学的进步常常是因技术发明造成的。,These illustrate the point made by Harré (1969) that scientific progress is often made by technical innovation.
6502,会议论文的目的是使听众(研究同行）了解你的书面研究内容。,The purpose of a conference paper is to inform a gathered audience of peers about the contents of your written research.
6502,听众参会的目的乃是为了倾听你对研究及其关键组成部分的介绍。,The audience hasassembled to hear you speak about your research and its key components.
6502,会议论文不能以直接朗读你的研究/会议论文的形式表达。,Conference papers should not be presented as a direct 'reading' of your research/conference paper.
6502,通篇朗读你将在会议期间散发的材料，或者已经收录在会议论文集当中的文章全文，这对听众来说是一种侮辱。,It is an insult to audiences to present your paper by reading out what you are going to hand out or what already appears in the conference proceedings.
6503,随着时间的推移，绘制地图的工艺水平和用来绘制地图的信息质量有了稳步提高。,"Over time, the art of mapmaking and the quality of information used to make maps got steadily better."
6503,有人首次沿非洲的海岸线进行了考察，因此，绘制出的地图更加精确了。到了18世纪，绘制出的海岸线已基本与现代地图中的海岸线看起来难分伯仲。,"The coastline of Africa was first explored, then plotted with growing accuracy, and by the eighteenth century that coastline was shown in a manner essentially indistinguishable from that of modern maps."
6503,沿海城市和人口也相当详实地展现在地图上。,Cities and peoples along the coast were also shown with great fidelity.
6504,在这些范式视角的指导之下，定性方法论将会取得对于所研究的旅游现象的深层理解。,
6504,研究结论的描述和分析也必然是深入而翔实的。,The resultant data provide rich and thick descriptions for analysis.
6504,定量方法是基于实证主义和混沌理论范式的，该范式将旅游现象的本质或者视为线性因果联系，或者视为非线性复杂联系，而且是可以用数字测量的。,"The use of a quantitative methodology is predicated to positivist and chaos theory paradigms, wherein tourism phenomenon are considered to be either linear-causal or non-linear chaotic in nature and able to be numerically measured."
6505,纯理论研究有时也指基础研究。,Pure research is sometimes referred to as basic research.
6505,它是构建理论、框架、模式的研究。,"It is research from which theories, frameworks and models are constructed."
6505,纯理论或基础性的研究增进了我们对世界的了解。,Pure or basic research advances our knowledge of the world.
6506,这种不平等的结构化地理可以用简单的方式得到解释，用下面一个最近发生的、不为人知但有趣的事件来说明：中美洲的小国哥斯达黎加试图通过销售“基因资源”来挣钱。,"This uneven geography of structuration can be illustrated, in simple terms, by the following interpretation of a recent, little-known but fascinating event: the attempt by the small, central American country Costa Rica to make money by selling off its ‘genetic resources’."
6506,像其他中美洲国家一样，从全球来看哥斯达黎加是一个相对贫穷的国家，属于“发展中国家”。,"Like other central American counties, Costa Rica is relatively poor in global terms and classed as a ‘developing country’."
6506,它的主要收人来源是靠出口咖啡豆和香蕉。,Its principal means of income is the export of coffee beans and bananas.
6507,在著名的《法的精神》中，孟德斯鸠把某种近似于科学的方法应用于社会的比较研究。,Montesquieu in his famous text on The Spirit of the Laws applied something loosely akin to scientific method to the comparative study of societies.
6507,"他揭示出支撑人类历史表面混乱和纷繁复杂的统治形式的根本原因,把土地和气候作为基本原因之一。",He set out to uncover the fundamental causes that underlie the seeming chaos of human history and the enormous diversity of governmental forms.And one of the fundamental causes identified was soil and climate.
6507,他写道：“精神和激情在不同的气候中是完全不同的，如果这是真的，那么法就必须对应于激情的差异和精神的差异。,"""If it is true,"" he wrote, ""that mentalities and passions are extremely different in different climates, then the laws must correspond to the difference of passions and to the difference in mentality."""
6507,"”这种差异地理学的环境基础并没有使他陷入纯粹的环境决定论，因为好政府的任务是使法律和道德秩序适应主导的物质环境(Cassirer，1968:214;Glacken, 1967, 572—581)。","This environmental foundation to the geography of difference did not lead him to pure environmental determinism, for it was the task of good government to bring about an adjustment of laws, and of moral order, to prevailing physical circumstances (Cassirer, 1968: 214; Glacken, 1967: 572—81)."
6508,有了上述对种族主义和种族歧视的说明，我们可以这样解释少数群体居住的集聚（congregation)与隔离（segregation) 过程 ，它们与被东道主社会同化（assimilation) 这一过程相反。同化过程本身是由各种形式的群体行为控制的，这些行为是为了将来自外部群体真实的和预期的威胁最小化。,"Given these caveats about racism and discrimination, we can interpret minority group residential congregation and segregation as being inversely related to the process of assimilation with the host society, a process that is itself governed by various forms of group behaviour designed to minimize real or perceived threats to the group from outsiders."
6508,不过，在深人分析这种行为及其空间结果之前，首先有必要明确“少数群体”、“东道主社会”、“隔离”和“同化”这几个术语的含义。,"But before going on to examine this behaviour and its spatial consequences in detail, it is first necessary to clarify the meaning of terms such as ‘minority group’, ‘host society’, ‘segregation’ and ‘assimilation’."
6509,在城市社会内部，存在着一些可以解释城市社会空间集聚和隔离的积极原因。,There are several rational reasons for segregation within urban society.
6509,不同“社区”的空间隔离有助于减少各社会群体之间的冲突并加强社会管理，同时赋予特定社会群体更具凝聚力的政治声音。,The spatial segregation of different ‘communities’ helps to minimize conflict between social groups while facilitating a greater degree of social control and endowing specific social groups with a more cohesive political voice.
6509,社会群体在居住上形成集群的另外一个重要原因是，其成员希望以此来维护该群体的身份认同或生活方式。,Another important reason for the residential clustering of social groups is the desire of its members to preserve their own group identity or lifestyle.
6509,群体规范是上述隔离现象得以形成的基本机制之一，这种规范支持群体内的通婚，反对不同社会、宗教、种族及人种背景的群体之间通婚。,"One of the basic mechanisms by which this segregation can be achieved is through group norms that support marriage within the group and oppose marriage between members of different social, religious, ethnic or racial groups."
6510,定量研究方法包括：问卷调查法、结构化访谈法、历时研究法、案例研究法、文献档案法、模型法、观察法、准试验法和影响评估法等。,"Quantitative methods include questionnaires and structured interviews, longitudinal studies, case studies, the documentary method, modelling, observation, the quasi-experimental method and impact assessment methods."
6510,定量分析包括：包含集中趋势量数的描述性统计、相关性测量和推断性统计。,"Analysis involves descriptive statistics including measures of central tendency, measures of association and inferential statistics."
6510,计算机为研究的设计和分析提供了附加工具和一些用于定量分析的软件包，例如Methodologist’s Toolchest、 SphinxSurvey、SPSS、Minitab、SAS 和 winMAX 等。,"Computers provide an additional tool in research designing and analysis, and some quantitatively based software packages include Methodologist's Toolchest, SphinxSurvey, SPSS, Minitab, SAS and winMAX."
6511,电子问卷的主要优点是联系的范围和速度。,The main advantages of e-questionnaires are the scope and speed of contact.
6511,而最主要的限制是它只能研究使用信息技术的人群。,
6511,,The major limitation is the extent to which the population being studied uses IT.
6511,"主要优点与以下几个方面相关：采用电子问卷进行调查很省心（像计算机辅助电话调查一样，问卷与资料分析程序相连;然而，电子问卷不需要操作者记录数据,它是由受访者完成的）；管理费用低；收集数据的速度比邮寄、电话、访问调查法都要快。","The key advantages relate to: the ease of conduct of an e-questionnaire (questionnaires can be linked to data analysis programs, as is the case with computer-assisted telephone interviews; however, e-questionnaires do not require the data recording to be completed by an operator — the respondent does that); the cost of conduct is minimal; the speed of data collection is faster than mail, telephone or interceptsurveys."
6512,数据编码包括编码的形成、数据输入及数据整理。,"Coding data involves the development of codes, data entry and datacleaning."
6512,数据输入可使用转换表、页缘编码、直接数据输入、扫描仪、电子数据表以及人工记录单。,"Data entry can be undertaken using transfer sheets, edge-coding, direct data entry, scanners, spreadsheets and manual tally sheets."
6512,数据的整理是与编码式整理和逻辑整理相关联的。,Data cleaning is associated with code cleaning and contingency cleaning.
6513,这使得进一步深究下述问题成为可能，为什么地方在当代世界中正变得越来越重要而非相反。,This permits a second cut at why place is becoming more rather than less important in the contemporary world.
6513,海德格尔的主张，以及其后许多作家从他那里吸收的，是有可能抵抗或拒绝地方建设之任何简单的资本主义(或现代主义)逻辑。,"What Heidegger holds out, and what many subsequent writers have drawn from him, is the possibility of some kind of resistance to or rejection of any simple capitalist (or modernist) logic of place construction."
6513,由此可以推断，技术合理性、商品化、市场价值和资本积累不断增强的对社会生活(或者如包括哈贝马斯在内的许多作家所称“生活世界”)的渗透，加之时空压缩，将激发一些抵抗，这些抵抗越来越强地聚集于地方(在这个词的最广泛意义上来理解)的替代性建造上。,"It would then follow that the increasing penetration of technological rationality, of commodification and market values, and capital accumulation into social life (or into what many writers, including Habermas, call ""the life world"") together with time-space compression, will provoke resistances that increasingly focus on alternative constructions of place (understood in the broadest sense of that word)."
6514,推论统计需要使用概率抽样，对检验假设及其与所研究总体之间的关系有重要意义。,Inferential statistics require the use of probability sampling and are important to test a hypothesis and its relationship to the overall population being studied.
6514,推断统计的检验包括卡方检验（用于定类测量）及方差分析（用于定距测量）。,Tests of inferential statistics include chi-square (used with nominal levels of measurement) and ANOVA (used with interval levels of measurement).
6514,推论统计也包括研究人员检验统计显著性、考虑统计显著性水平以及一类错误、二类错误。,"Inferential statistics also involve researchers in tests of statistical significance, consideration of levels of significance, and Type I and Type II errors."
6515,任何研究中都有可能在假设检验中出现错误。,"In any study, there is always a possibility of error being introduced in the testing of hypotheses."
6515,错误可分为一类错误和二类错误两种类型。,The errors may be described as one of two types — Type I or Type II .
6515,一类错误指零假设被证伪，而事实上该假设成立。,Type I errors occur when the null hypothesis is rejected when in fact i t is true.
6515,二类错误指当零假设事实上不成立但却被证实。,Type II errors occur when the null hypothesis is accepted when in fact it is false.
6515,表9 - 8概括了假设检验中产生的错误类型。,Table 9.8 outlines the types of error that may arise in hypothesis testing.
6516,对我来说，离开对土地的爱、尊敬和赞扬以及对其价值的高度重视，还能够与土地保持一种伦理关系，这是不可想象的。,"It is inconceivable to me that an ethical relation to land can exist without love, respect and admiration for the land, and a high regard for its value."
6516,提到价值，我当然是指远比经济价值更广泛的东西；我指的是哲学意义上的价值。所以，当一件东西趋向于保护生命共同体的完整性、稳定性和美的时候，它才是对的。,"By value, I of course mean something far broader than mere economic value; I mean value in the philosophical sense so that a thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community."
6516,反之，它则是错的。,It is wrong when it tends otherwise.
6517,随着“永久地”让渡的合法边界的抽象而来的是价格的抽象（和租金）、以单一标准衡量的财产价值的尺度。,"To the abstraction of legal boundaries alienated ""in perpetuity"" was added the abstraction of price (and land rent), a measurement of property's value assessed on a unitary scale."
6517,“最重要的是，把土地和财产当成商品拿到市场上买卖，这一点正是英国人在所有权理解上与印第安人的不同”。,"""More than anything else, it was the treatment of land and property as commodities traded at market that distinguished English conceptions of ownership from Indian ones."""
6517,殖民者的价值体系建立在社会地建构起来的时空母体上，这一母体与印第安共同体的母体完全不一样。,The value system of the colonizers was set in a matrix of socially constructed space-time which was radically at odds with that of the Indian community.
6518,非概率抽样包括就近抽样、目标式抽样、滚雪球抽样和专家抽样。,"Non-probability sampling includes convenience, purposive, snowball sampling and expert sampling."
6518,概率抽样包括简单随机抽样（抽签方法、名称方法、出生日期或电脑方法）、系统抽样、分层抽样和多阶整群抽样。,"Non-probability sampling includes simple random sampling (lottery method, first name, date of birth or computer-generated methods), stratified sampling, cluster sampling and multi-stage sampling."
6518,另外还有配额抽样，它属于一种准随机抽样的方法。,"Quota sampling, a quasi-random sampling method, is also used."
6519,尽管地理研究显然要对广大区域进行归纳，但是分析的焦点也可以向相反的方向转移。,"Despite an obvious geographical need to generalize over wide areas, the focus of analysis often moves in the opposite direction."
6519,这种简化法曾经是科学的标志，在有些情况下确实是要用显微镜来观察隐含的结构和过程。,"Such reductionism has been the hallmark of science, in some cases quite literally using the microscope to examine underlying structures and processes."
6519,"因此，安德森和伯特(Anderson and Burt, 1978)研究的基础是对土壤水分在土壤中运动的深入观察，以便更好地了解水文曲线中径流滞后形成的原因。","Thus, the basis of Anderson and Burt’s (1978) study was a detailed examination of soil moisture movement in soil, in order to better understand the way in which delayed throughflow hydrographs were generated."
6520,但是，在大多数研究城市的著作中，居民能够行动自如被认为是理所当然的，而伊姆里指出这其实是一种健全者地理学（ableist geography)。,"In most writing on cities the able-bodied character of citizens is taken for granted and this, Imrie argues, amounts to an ableist geography."
6520,因此，帕克等人指出，“人文地理学中过去很少有研究残疾人的空间”。,Park et al. note that ‘Human geography has in the past found little room for studies of disability'.
6520,作为一位因风湿性关节炎而残疾的教授，维拉•乔伊纳德深刻地揭露了这一问题的本质。,"The character of the problem has been movingly revealed by Vera Chouinard, a professor disabled by rheumatoid arthritis."
6521,双变量分析考虑两个变量之间的关系，两个变量间或者彼此相关，或者彼此无关。,"Bivariate analysis considers the relationship between two variables,which may or may not be related to each other."
6521,相关的变量可描述为证明共变，无关的变量在任何情况下都可描述为独立相关。,Variables that arerelated are described as demonstrating covariation; variables that arenot related in any way are described as having an independent relationship.
6521,判定两个变量间的关系有很多种方法：交叉表、散点图和相关性测量。,"There are a number of ways to determine relationships between two variables: cross-tabulation, scattergrams and measures of association."
6522,其他作者认为关注压迫的等级结构——假设某种社会关系比其他社会关系更重要——已经导致一种新的实在论的危险，它把某些社会定位，如阶级、性别等，置于多种压迫的核心位置，而不是谨慎地将在什么样的条件下哪种差异更重要的问题理论化。,"Other writers have argued that focusing on hierarchies of oppression – assuming that particular social relations matter more than others – has instead instigated what has threatened to become a new form of essentialism, valorizing particular social locations, such as class or gender, at the heart of multiple oppressions rather than theorizing carefully which differences matter under what conditions."
6522,更具建设性的是，其他一些学者还发展出了交叉性的概念，以便于对多重身份的理解。,
6522,,"More productively, others still have developed the notion of intersectionality as a means of understanding multiple identifications."
6522,（Crenshaw，1995）,"(Crenshaw, 1995)"
6523,一种新的社会主义理论必须以“地方”为中心。,A new theory of socialism must now centrally involve place.
6523,人们牢记的论点是，无产阶级没有祖国，不占有把它与有产阶级区分出来的那些要素。,"Remember the argument was that the proletariat had no country, the factor which differentiated it from the property owning classes."
6523,但是，因为国际经济的爆炸性增长和老式共同体非工业化的破坏性后果，地方巳经成为联合过程的至关重大的因素——对无产阶级或许比占有资本的阶级更重要。,But place has been shown to be a crucial element in the bonding process — more so perhaps for the working class than the capital-owning classes — by the explosion of the international economy and the destructive effects of deindustrialization upon old communities.
6523,当资本流动时，地方的重要性就更清晰地显现出来。,"When capital has moved on, the importance of place is more clearly revealed."
6523,（Williams，1989a：242),"(Williams, 1989a:242)"
6524,北端区不仅紧邻于工业区，更糟的是里面有各种各样的工作和商业场所，它们与住宅错综复杂地混在一起。,"Not only is the North End bumped right up against industry, but worse still it has all kinds of working places and commerce mingled in the greatest complexity with irs residences."
6524,与波士顿任何一个可居住单元相比，这儿的密度是最高的，也许是美国所有城市中最高的。,"It has the highest concentration of dwelling units, on the land that is used for dwelling units, of any part of Boston, and indeed one of the highest concentrations to be found in any American city."
6524,它的公园用地很少孩子们在街上玩耍。,It has little park-land.Children play in the streets.
6524,那儿没有超级街区(车辆禁行街区），甚至连像样一点的大街区也没有，有的只是非常小的街区；用规划的行话来说就是“支离破碎，街道浪费。”,"Instead of super-blocks, or even decently large blocks, it has very small blocks; in planning parlance it is ""badly cut up with wasteful streets."""
6525,弗兰克•哈韦是北端协会，当地的一个街区服务中心(settlement house)的主任。他说，“我在北端已经有28年了，在这么长的时间里，我还从没有听说过一件强奸、抢劫、骚扰孩子和其他类似的街头犯罪。如果有的话，在上报前，我肯定会有所耳闻。,"Frank Havey, director of the North End Union, the local settlement house, says, ""I have been here in the North End twenty-eight years, and in all that time I have never heard of a single case of rape, mugging, molestation of a child or other street crime of that son in the district. And if there had been any, I would have heard of it even if it did not reach the papers."""
6526,电话调査主要是结构式访谈，采用封闭式问题。访问者使用电话技术与受访者交流，并记录答案。,"Telephone surveys are primarily structured interviews using closed questions, with an interviewer recording the respondent's answers.Contact with respondents is made using telephone technology."
6526,计算机技术可以协助电话技术，在这种情况下，使用软件程序可以迅速记录受访者的回答，分析程序也有助于整合访谈数据。,"Telephone technology may be further assisted by computer technology, in which case the responses are immediately recorded using software programs that integrate the responses with analysis procedures."
6527,正如第二章所介绍的那样，这种新制度的特征是通过专门化产品的范围经济来实现持续不断的可获得全球竞争力的创新。,"As introduced in Chapter 2, this new regime is characterized by continuous innovation to achieve global competitiveness via economies of scope in specialized products."
6527,有人认为，在解除管制的全球金融体系下，这种方法是补偿大众市场饱和以及政府参与凯恩斯主义需求管理政策的能力不足所必需的。,"This approach, it is argued, is necessary to compensate for the saturation of mass markets and the inability of states to engage in Keynesian policies of demand management in a deregulated global financial system."
6527,这就要求一种新型的管制方式，而其中的福利利益让位于商业利益。,This requires a new mode of regulation in which the interests of welfare are subordinated to those of business.
6528,“自我实现”的理想广泛存在于生态学文献。,"Ideals of ""self-realization"" are widespread in the ecological literature."
6528,它们在某种意义上接近马克思通过研究人类的创造力来关心人类解放和自我发展，特别是他在《1844年经济学哲学手稿》以及《政治经济学批判草稿(大纲)》中相关的讨论。,"They parallel in certain ways Marx's concerns, particularly in The Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844 but also in later works such as the Grundrisse, for human emancipation and self-development through the working out of our creative powers."
6528,然而，马克思主义传统一如既往地关注贫困和匮乏，生产力的解放最终成为通往更广泛的人类自我实现目标之主导的且在某种程度上唯一的手段。,"In the Marxist tradition, however, quite properly concerned as it has been with impoverishment and deprivation, the liberation of the productive forces came to be seen as the privileged and to some degree exclusive means towards the broader goal of human self-realization (see Grundmann, 1991b: 54)."
6528,这样，它就成为目标本身。,"As such, it became a goal in itself."
6529,以排他性的和老生常谈的方式来定义“他者”是通往自我定义的第一步。,"Defining the ""other"" in an exclusionary and stereotypical way is the first step towards self-definition."
6529,重新发现地方，如海德格尔例子所表明的，对于建构任何类型的进步政治来说，危险与机会一样多。,"The rediscovery of place, as the case of Heidegger shows, poses as many dangers as opportunities for the construction of any kind of progressive politics."
6529,如萨义德在其《东方学》(Said，1978)中示范的那样，解构和后现代冲动确实提供了一种工具，可以用来反对令人震惊的对其他地方的模式化，但是，在文化大众的总体工作中，存在着巨大的公共视角、再现和政治学的困难，这是急需正视的。,"Deconstruction and the postmodern impulse, as Said (1978) demonstrates in his study of Orientalism, certainly provide a means to attack the appalling stereotyping of other places, but there is a huge problem of public perspectives, representation, and politics within the overall work of the cultural mass in this regard that desperately needs to be confronted."
6530,"由于水、太阳辐射和养分均可能受限制，克莱门茨（Clements,1928）的演替概念曾被解释为导致气候顶极植被。","Because any of water, radiation and nutrients can be limiting, the succession concept of Clements (1928) has been interpreted as leading to the climate climax vegetation."
6530,气候植被顶极和演替概念暗含着植被达到这个容量取决于增长极限的假设。,The assumption that the vegetation reaches the capacity determined by the limits of growth is implicit in the climatic climax vegetation and the concept of succession.
6530,它形成了从气候方面解释植被覆盖的历史证据（例如在古生物学上）， 以及重建全球气候变化造成过去植被变化的基础。,"It forms the basis of the interpretation of historical evidence of vegetation cover in climatic terms (for example, in palynology) and the reconstruction of past vegetation shifts resulting from global climate change."
6531,解释社会学范式、冲突理论范式和女性主义范式都采用定性的内容分析。,"Qualitative content analysis is used by the interpretive social sciences paradigm, the critical theory paradigm and the feminist perspectives paradigm."
6531,同样，在使用这些范式进行旅游研究时，当然也可以进行定性内容分析。,It can also be used in tourism research informed by these paradigms.
6531,与定量内容分析一样，定性内容分析的方法也有一些科学规则。,"As with quantitative content analysis, the method of qualitative content analysis has scientific protocols."
6531,这些规则与德伊（1993）所提出的那些关于定性资料的分析原则相似。,The protocols are not unlike those Dey (1993) notes in regard to qualitative data analysis.
6532,解释性调査法目的在于检验假设（一种因果关系）。,Explanatory surveys are designed to test a hypothesis (a causal relationship).
6532,举例来说，为了验证到维多利亚(Victoria)菲利浦岛(Philip Island)游览的本地居民多于非本地居民，研究者就会进行调査设计，来收集到此参观的游客的居住地和旅游类型的数据资料。,"For example, to test the hypothesis that more locals visit Phillip Island in Victoria than non-locals, the researcher would design a survey to collect data on place of residence and visitation patterns to Phillip Island."
6532,通过数据分析，研究者就可以确定到该地参观的游客居住地和其旅游类型之间存在的所有关系，然后证实或推翻假设。,"Through data analysis, the researcher would determine the existence of any relationship between place of residency and visitation patterns to Phillip Island, then either accept or reject the hypothesis."
6533,正如纯理论研究可以采用探索性的、描述性的和解释性的研究方法一样，应用性研究也可采用这样一些研究方法。,"Just as pure research draws on several approaches, that is exploratory, descriptive and explanatory research, so too does applied research."
6533,但是，应用性研究涉及了更多的研究方法：探索性的、描述性的、解释性的、因果关系的、比较性的、评价性的、预测性的 (所有这些方法都将在下面予以解释）。,"However, applied research draws on a wider range of approaches: exploratory, descriptive, explanatory, causal, comparative, evaluative and predictive (all of these terms are explained below)."
6533,但这些方法并不是互相排斥的。,
6533,,This does not mean to imply that each of these approaches is mutually exclusive.
6534,揭示人们对“地方感”需要“感情投入”地探究感觉、情绪和价值观的领域。,"Disclosing people’s ‘sense of place’ requires ‘empathetic’ enquiries into the realms of feelings, emotions and values."
6534,在像利这样的学者向人文地理学界推出所谓“解释学方法”后大约30年间，对地方的主观依恋或对地方的主观理解显然仍和以往一样重要。,"Some three decades after the likes of Ley launched this so-called ‘hermeneutic approach’ in human geography, it’s clear that subjective attachments to, or interpretations of, place matter as much as ever."
6534,尽管有全球性的互相依赖，但大多数人还是生活在若干平方千米的范围内。,"Global interdependency notwithstanding, most people live their lives within just a few square kilometres."
6535,我们在这条街道上的居民们做了一切能做的事。,We people on the street did what we could.
6535,印刷店的老板把他手头一份急活停了下来，专门在星期六的早上赶印了很多紧急请愿书，这样在孩子们放学时，可以帮助分发。,"The job printer stopped his press, took off of it work on which he had an urgent deadline, and printed emergency petitions on a Sarurday moring so the children, out of school, could help get them around."
6535,邻近街区的人们也拿走了请愿书散发到更远的地方。,People from overlapping street neighborhoods took petitons and spread them farther.
6536,经费预算表同工作进度表一样，在形式上与引言、文献综述和方法论部分均不同。,"The budget section, like the time line, differs in style from the introduction, literature review and methodology sections."
6536,经费预算部分不包含大量的文字描述，只是在这部分的开始通常会概括性说明经费总额及在附件中是否包含引注。,The budget section does not contain a lot of textual description.You should commence the section with an overview statement that indicates the complete budget amount and indicate if any quotes have been included in the appendices.
6536,采用线形项目经费预算法是个体经费预算项目当中最为简单易行的方式。,Organising the budget into a simple line item budget is the easiest representation of the individual budget items.
6536,通常，为了降低整个项目的成本，资助方通常会减少经费预算，因而在制订投标书的过程中，最好按照急需资助的优先顺序对经费预算项目进行排列。,"When completing tenders, you may be asked to rank the budget items as to their priority for funding, as often budgets will be cut by the tender receivers to reduce the overall cost of the project."
6537,一种新的社会主义理论必须以“地方”为中心。,A new theory of socialism must now centrally involve place.
6537,人们牢记的论点是，无产阶级没有祖国，不占有把它与有产阶级区分出来的那些要素。,"Remember the argument was that the proletariat had no country, the factor which differentiated it from the property owning classes."
6537,但是，因为国际经济的爆炸性增长和老式共同体非工业化的破坏性后果，地方已经成为联合过程的至关重大的因素——对无产阶级或许比占有资本的阶级更重要。,But place has been shown to be a crucial element in the bonding process — more so perhaps for the working class than the capital-owning lasses — by the explosion of the international economy and the destructive effects of deindustrialization upon old communities.
6538,在人文地理学内部，引入系统分析和模拟复杂相互关系的尝试已是某些经济地理学领域的特点，尤其在与国际、区域或城市范围内经济增长有关的那些领域。,"Within human geography, attempts to introduce systems analysis and the modelling of complex interrelationships have characterized certain areas of economic geography, notably those concerned with economic growth in an international, regional, or urban context."
6538,一个典范实例是普雷德（Pred，1977a）关于城市增长动力学的研究，其基础在于用输入-输出公式表示一种经济结构。,"(A good example is the work of Pred, 1977a, on the dynamics of urban growth, whose basis lies in the input-output formulation of the structure of an economy."
6538,因为要获取数据来检验作为整体而不是作为一系列分离假设的模型，很多关于各种系统的这种研究一直停滞在建模阶段，然而系统方法的引入已使人文地理学在专门技术上有了重大收获。,"Much of this work on systems has stopped at the model building stage, because of problems of obtaining data to test the models as wholes rather than as series of separate hypotheses.Hence the introduction of a systems approach has led to considerable acquisition of technical expertise by the discipline."
6539,理解住房市场的一个有效方法是，把住房市场看做一系列“参与者”在各种政治及制度制约下的集中行动，这些集中行动的结果体现在空间上，就表现为土地利用的变化、所有权模式、社区的变迁、住房价格和住房质量等方面（图6—1)。,"In general it is useful to think in terms of housing markets as the focus for a variety of ‘actors’ operating within the various constraints of political and institutional contexts, the result of which are spatial outcomes that can be identified in terms of land use changes, occupancy patterns, social area changes, housing prices and housing quality (Fig. 6.1)."
6539,传统的住房子市场的定义表述为住房的存量特征（房屋类型、租赁形式和价格）、家庭类型（家庭地位、经济地位、种族）或者是区位（图 6—2)。,"Traditional definitions of housing submarkets have been couched in terms of the attributes of housing stock (type of dwelling, type of tenancy and price), household type (family status, economic status and ethnicity) or location (Fig. 6.2)."
6539,不过，在任何给定的城市中，住房子市场通常都不可能划分得如此整齐和清晰。,"But it is unusual for housing submarkets to form such neat, discrete compartments within any given city."
6540,现在让我们回到现代性的现实情况。,Now let’s return to the reality that is modernity.
6540,事后我们能够看到富国经济发展不是真正的终点;这些国家的经济转变是跳跃式前进的，而且与髙科技工业分不开。,"In hindsight, we can see that economic development in the rich countries is not actually an end-point, economic change in these countries has proceeded in leaps and bounds with new high-tech industries."
6540,相反，往昔的“发展中国家”却在经济上越来越落后。,"In contrast, most of the erstwhile ‘developing countries’ are economically falling further and further behind."
6541,另一个较大的争议是围绕决定城市模式因子中经济因子与文化因子孰轻孰重的问题。,Another big controversy has surrounded the relative importance of economic and cultural factors in determining the form of cities.
6541,其中的一个极端是，一些研究陷人了经济决定（economic determinism)的陷阱，认为变化中的城市经济结构决定相应的社会和文化模式；而另一个极端最近占了上风，它被认为是“文化决定论”的一种形式，因为文化问题已经成为现代经济中的关键问题。,"At one extreme, some studies have fallen into the trap of economic determinism, assuming that the changing economic structure of cities determines the accompanying social and cultural forms.The other extreme, which has come to the fore more recently, might be seen as a form of ‘cultural determinism’, since it assumes that cultural issues have become crucial in contemporary economies."
6541,因此，它讨论文化影响生产什么（日益增加的电视、电影、音乐和软件）以及如何生产（在公司中“工作文化”问题要比过去更加严重）。,"Thus, it is argued that culture affects what is produced (increasingly videos, films, music and software) as well as how it is produced (in firms that take issues of ‘work culture’ much more seriously than in the past)."
6542,而且，需要仔细测量污染和资源损耗的成本，因为第二个约束认为经济增长(资本积累)和环境质量之间存在着一个零和均衡。过度顾虑后者就不必要地放弃前者的利益。,And it also requires careful measurement of costs of pollution and resource depletion because the second constraint is that there is thought to be a zero-sum trade-off between economic growth (capital accumulation) and environmental quality.To be overly solicitous with respect to the latter is to forgo unnecessarily the benefits of the former.
6542,这是货币化成本效益分析的领域，这种分析现在对于塑造标准观点中的环境政治学发挥着非常重要的作用。,This is the domain of monetized cost—benefit analysis which now plays such an important role in shaping environmental politics under the standard view.
6543,把红色对我们感官产生的影响还原成它的纯粹物理概念，就如同把景观的意义还原成对它的地理要素的描绘，都会丧失美学经验追求的本质。,To reduce the impact of the color red upon our senses to its purely physical concept was to lose something in exactly the same way that the reduction of a landscape's meaning to a description of its geological components was to lose the essence of what esthetic experience was about.
6543,因此，必须在表象和直接效果层次上，更重要的是在总体性层次上来维持美学。,"Esthetics therefore had to remain at the level of surface appearance, immediate impact and, most important of all, at the level of the totality."
6543,如果不诉诸某种类似于莱布尼茨式奇想的东西，美学知识是很难达及的。,And esthetic knowledge was very hard to come by without resort to something akin to the Leibnizian conceit.
6544,筛选数据是指对大量的数据进行提炼，按现有类别、主题和概念分门别类。,"Data reduction is associated with the distillation of rich data into identifiable categories, themes and concepts."
6544,展示数据是指将上述的类别、主题和概念以表意的形式加以呈现。,"Data displays are the ideographic presentations of the categories, themes and concepts."
6544,展示的方法包括：图示法、分类法、 矩阵法和对在大量数据中持续反复出现的主题、主旨、相互关系和程序进行可视的（文本性的）描述。,"These may range from maps, taxonomies, matrices and models to visual (and textual) portrayals of the distillation of constantly reoccurring themes and motifs and relationships and processes found in the rich data."
6545,对具化的研究反映出另外一种努力，即避免笛卡尔在论述世界时明确的思想与身体的分离。,This work on embodiment represents another attempt to avoid the mind/body split that is evident in Cartesian reasoning about the world.
6545,正如我们在第一章所见，这种分离的观点是基于这样一个错误假设，即作者“没有特定的历史背景，是一个无社区、无身体的成员”。,"As we saw in Chapter 1, this detached view is based on the mistaken assumption that the writer ‘. . . has no particular history, is member of no community, has no body’ (Young, 1978, cited in Duncan, 1996, emphasis added)."
6545,相反，“具体知识”（‘ embodied knowledge’）的概念（也被称为地方知识或根植性知识）公开认同了观点、概念和分析都是来源于处在特定时间和特定地点中的人。,"In contrast, the concept of embodied knowledge (also termed local or situated knowledge) explicitly acknowledges that ideas, concepts and analyses emerge from people in specific places at particular times."
6546,从理论上说，专家的专业技能是“现成的”而不是“顶尖的”，但是有很多人（如马克思•韦伯）认为，政府程序的极端复杂性已经带来了“官员垄断”。,"In theory, the expert professional is ‘on tap’but not ‘on top’, but there are many who believe, like Max Weber, that the sheer complexity of governmental procedure has brought about a‘dictatorship of the official’."
6546,例如，莱恩伯里认为专业人士的影响是如此巨大，而且他们所操纵的决策规则（decision rules)是如此复杂，以至于他们能够有效地将许多公共服务业配置从哪怕是最强大的政治权力组织的控制中夺过来。,"Lineberry, for instance, argued that the influence of professional personnel can be so great and the decision rules by which they operate so complex as to effectively remove the allocation of most public services from the control of even the strongest political power groups."
6546,这里至关重要的一点是，专业化官员的目标和动机并不总是与公众的最大利益相一致，或者与他们的选举代表的意见相一致。,The crucial point here is that the objectives and motivations of professional officers are not always coincident with the best interests of the public nor in accordance with the views of theirelected representatives.
6547,目标读者为决策者的报告，内容应该包括关于研究是如何进行的简短总结。,The content of reports for decision makers should include a short summary of how the study was conducted.
6547,"主要焦点应该落在研究结果上，还应该使用图像帮助理解研究结果，如曲线图和图表(Neuman 1994, p. 473)。","The main focus should be on the results.Visual inputs should be used to assist the communication of the results, such as graphs and tables (Neuman 1994, p. 473)."
6547,研究结构及研究结果的细节可以放在附录中，这样，那些对这两部分感兴趣的读者就能够找到它们（Neuman 2000)。,Specifics of research design and findings can be situated in the appendices so that those who are interested in reading these sections will be able to access them (Neuman 2000).
6547,目标读者为决策者的技术性报告，一般会采用前面已经详细介绍过的科学实验报告的结构。,Technical reports for decision makers will generally follow the structure of the scientific research report detailed earlier.
6548,这些决定论（determinist theory)观点可在几个方面得以论证。,Evidence to support these tenets of determinist theory has been assembled on several fronts.
6548,心理超载（psychological overload)观点便是有利的论据之一。该观点来自环境心理学家的调査研究。后来托夫勒推广了这个观点。他认为：在此情形下对于其他信息的寻求相处理会导致“未来-簾惊”：一种对于过分刺激的人类反应。,"The idea of psychological overload resulting from complex or unfamiliar environments has been investigated by environmental psychologists and popularized by Alvin Toffler (1970), who suggested that the need to ‘scoop up and process’ additional information in such situations can lead to ‘future-shock’: the human response to overstimulation."
6549,虽然我们假定仅仅对某些参数值会出现多重均衡，但我们很难从这个模型中得出这样的结论：存在多重均衡的可能性很大。,"One would hardly conclude from this model that the existence of multiple equilibria is highly likely, even given the assumptions that such multiple equilibria will occur only for some parameter values."
6549,另外，人们很容易对这些假定的正确性提出怀疑。,And it is easy to critique the plausibility of the assumptions.
6549,不过这个模型仍可作为考察发展模型的一个有用出发点。,Yet the model can serve as a useful jumping-off point for thinking about development models.
6550,烤鸡业的普遍工作条件对健康非常不利。,The conditions prevailing within the chicken broiler industry are less than salubrious.
6550,沙门氏菌污染是一种地方性问题，污染问题也很普遍，对生产条件的描述很可能会激起那些只对动物权利略微敏感的人的愤怒。,"Salmonella contamination is an endemic danger, pollution problems are rife, and descriptions of production conditions are liable to stir the ire of those only mildly sensitive to animal rights."
6550,烤鸡产业的附属业是鸡肉加工业，250个工厂内雇佣15万名工人，它们主要位于非常小的城镇或贯穿于“烤鸡地带”的乡村环境中。,"Ancillary to broiler-chicken production, is a chicken-processing industry employing 150,000 workers in 250 or so plants, mostly located in very small towns or rural settings throughout the ""Broiler Belt."""
6551,按照实证主义范式的观点，研究者与研究对象或客体之间的关系是客观且价值中立的。,The relationship between the researcher and the subjects or objects is one that is objective and value free.
6551,研究者被默认为不会影响研究的结果或发现。,The researcher is assumed not to impact on or influence the results or findings in a research project.
6551,研究过程遵循严格的程序以确保对结果的客观性和价值中立的解释。,The conduct of research follows strict procedures to ensure objectivity and value-free interpretations.
6551,正因为如此，其他研究者才能够重复该研究并取得一致的研究结果。,"As a consequence, other researchers should be able to replicate the same piece of research and obtain the same findings."
6552,(3)社会关系总是空间的，并且存在于某种生产出来的空间性框架中。,3. Social relations are always spatial and exist within a certain produced framework of spatialities.
6552,换句话来说，无论在哪个方面，社会关系都是某种绘制的地图，无论是象征的、比喻的，还是物质的。,"Put another way, social relations are, in all respects, mappings of some sort, be they symbolic, figurative, or material."
6552,组织社会关系需要一种绘制行动，以便人们知道他们的位置。,The organization of social relations demands a mapping so that people know their place.
6552,革命行动需要对社会关系和当事人进行重新绘制，那些当事人不再承认他们先前被分配的位置。,Revolutionary activity entails a re-mapping of social relations and agents who no longer acknowledge that place to which they were formerly assigned.
6552,由此得出的结论是，空间关系(以及那些空间关系的话语)的生产是社会关系的产物，改变一种就是改变另一种。,From this it follows that the production of spatial relations (and of discourses about space relations) is a production of social relations and to alter one is to alter the other.
6553,地理学家——尤其是第二次世界大战后培养的那些——被这些模式所吸引。他们将其作为能够被检验的假设的基础，用严密的基于数量化方法的表面区位决策在经济上是合理的，新设施和道路规划能够以此类模式为基础。,"Geographers – especially those trained after the Second World War – were attracted to these models, as foundations for hypotheses that could be tested, using rigorous, quantitatively-based procedures to show both that locational decisionmaking was economically rational and that planning for new facilities and routes could be based on such models."
6553,此外，他们还重新发现了芝加哥大学社会学家和其他学者开发的有关“自然区域”中城市内部空间组织的模式。,"In addition, they ‘rediscovered’ models of the internal spatial organization of cities into ‘natural areas’ developed by sociologists and others at the University of Chicago."
6554,至于全球性和本土性的问题，与唯心主义者不同的是，唯物主义者所持的观点是，所有这些尺度都是在各种社会行动主体的积极作用下才被创造出来的。像全球性这样的尺度不是单纯地存在着，等待着被使用，而是要让其显现化。,"In contrast to idealists, then, materialists maintain that such scales as the local and the global are actively created through the practices of various social actors – scales do not just exist, waiting to be utilized, but must instead be brought into being."
6554,因此，跨国公司不仅仅是将它们的活动扩大到了早已存在的、地质意义上的以地球为边界的全球性尺度，而且必须积极地打造它们自己全球性尺度的运作方式。,"Thus, transnational corporations do not simply adapt their activities to a pre-made global scale defined by the Earth’s geologically given limits but must, instead, actively build their own global scale of operation."
6554,实际上，它们必须变成“全球性”的。,"They must, in effect, become ‘global’."
6555,很可能，每个人(除了这些场所的主人)都会同意这一类的用途大煞风景。,Probably everyone (except possibly the owners of such objects) is agreed that this category of uses is blighting.
6555,但这并不意味着垃圾场(junk yards)以及诸如此类的事因此就是城市多 样性必然带来的威胁。,But it does not follow that junk yards and their like are therefore threats which accompany city diversity.
6555,成功的城市地区从来就不会有这儿一个，那儿一个的垃圾场(junk yards)，但这并不是这些地区成功的原因。,"Successful city districts are never dotted with junk yards, but that is not why these districts are successful."
6555,恰恰相反，这些地方找不到乱七八糟的垃圾场(junk yards)是因为它们很成功。,It is the other way around.They lack junk yards because they are successful.
6556,案例研究需要弄清事情的来龙去脉——特定的机制与所研究地点特殊情况相作用造成可观察的事件，为我们提供了自然界运行方式的线索。,"A case-study experiment requires recontextualization – particular mechanisms interact with the specific contextual character of the location under study, to cause observable events which give us clues about the way nature works."
6556,一个例子是1850年以后观察到的美国西北部南普拉特河(South Platte River)河道格局变化的事件:河流上游水库蓄水以后，河流从辫状水系变成了曲流的形式。,"An example is the observed event of a change in channel pattern on the South Platte River after 1850, from a braided to a meandering form, following reservoir impoundment in its headwaters."
6556,流量控制降低了年平均洪水位时河流的动力。,This control of flow reduced the stream power at the mean annual flood.
6557,把红色对我们感官产生的影响还原成它的纯粹物理概念，就如同把景观的意义还原成对它的地理要素的描绘，都会丧失美学经验追求的本质。,To reduce the impact of the color red upon our senses to its purely physical concept was to lose something in exactly the same way that the reduction of a landscape's meaning to a description of its geological components was to lose the essence of what esthetic experience was about.
6557,因此，必须在表象和直接效果层次上维持美学，更重要的是在总体性层次上来维持美学。,"Esthetics therefore had to remain at the level of surface appearance, immediate impact and, most important of all, at the level of the totality."
6557,如果不诉诸某种类似于莱布尼茨式奇想的东西，美学知识是很难达及的。,And esthetic knowledge was very hard to come by without resort to something akin to the Leibnizian conceit.
6558,在资本主义制度下，劳动是一种被在市场上买卖的商品，并由此与工人异化。,"Labor under capitalism, is a commodity to be bought and sold, in the market place, and as such is alienated from the worker."
6558,当劳动分工变细后，异化也随之增加。,Alienation is increased as the division of labor becomes finer.
6558,这种非人性化影响资本主义社会的两大阵营(资产阶级和无产阶级）。,Such dehumanization affects both parties in a capitalist society (i.e.bourgeoisie and proletariat).
6559,我会在下面的三章里谈到这个问题。在四个生发多样性的条件中，有两个比较容易对付，主要是解决灰色地带的问题——老建筑都已经在那儿，随时可以发挥潜能;另一个条件是需要增加街道，这也不是办不到的难事。,"However, I shall anticipate the discussion in the next  three chapters to say this: Of the four generators of diversity, two represent easy problems to deal with in curing the troubles of gray areas --- aged buildings are usually already present to do their potential share; and additional streets where they are needed are not innately difficult to acquire."
6559,（与大规模的土地清空相比(我们已经在这方面浪费了很多资金，这仅仅是一个小问题。）,(They are a minor problem compared with the large scale land clearance we have been taught to waste our money on.)
6560,对于马克思来说，对物质社会实践世界的分析，对货币循环、商品生产和交换的分析，定义了一种复杂的社会关系和普遍评价的时空世界，在这个世界中，地方必然作为构造性因素存在于资本积累的历史地理之中。,"For Marx, analysis of the world of material social practices, of money circulation and commodity production, and exchange defines a spatio-temporal world of intricate social relations and universal valuations, within which places necessarily have their being as constitutive elements within the historical geography of capital accumulation."
6560,但是，这种时空世界也为我们“类存在物”定义了同样普遍的道德、经济和政治责任的领域。作为“类存在物”，尽管我们的特点是异化和剥削，但不得不通过阶级斗争的全球政治-经济战略来拯救。,"But this spatio-temporal world also defines an equally universal sphere of moral, economic, and political responsibility for our ""species being"" which, though characterized by alienation and exploitation, has to be rescued by a global political—economic strategy of class struggle."
6561,"当群落可利用的所有资源(水、太阳辐射、养分)均被消费以生产生物量时,就达到了这个上限。","The upper limit is reached when all the resources available to the community (water, radiation and nutrients) are consumed in producing biomass."
6561,"同样,稳定的下限会被固定于任何资源的限制—李比西定律。","Likewise, a lower stable limit would be fixed by any limitation on resources – Liebig’s Law."
6561,"其中任何一种都可能是“限制的”,而且在1960年代和1970年代,这些问题在“新生态学”中被重新解释为容量或潜力。","Any one of them might be ‘limiting’ and, in the 1960s and 1970s, they were reinterpreted in the ‘new ecology’ as the capacity or potential."
6562,资料三角校正是指研究者在研究过程引入多种资料来源。,Researchers concerned with data triangulation draw on various sources of data in the research process.
6562,调查者三角校正是指研究中雇用若干个研究者或评论者。,Investigator triangulation refers to the employment of several researchers or evaluators in a study.
6562,理论三角校正是指研究者用几种方法或视角分析资料。,Theory triangulation involves researchers using several theories or perspectives to analyse data.
6562,方法论的三角校正是指研究者使用多种方法收集与研究相关的资料。,Methodological triangulation involves researchers using several methods to gather data relevant to a study.
6563,整个18世纪就是在这种意义上理解理性的，即不是把它看作知识、原理和真理的容器，而是把它视为一种能力或一种力量，这种力量只有通过它的作用和结果才能充分理解。,"The whole eighteenth century understands reason ... not as a sound body of knowledge, principles, and truths, but as a kind of energy, a force which is fully comprehensible only in its agency and effects."
6563,理性的性质和力量，仅从结果是无法充分衡量的，只有根据功用才能看清。,"What reason is and what it can do, can never be known by its results but only by its function."
6563,理性最重要的功用，是它有结合和分解的能力。,And its most important function is to bind and to dissolve.
6564,对于那些对地理学思想史感兴趣的人来说，值得一提的是，奥尔森和我都同样被奥尔曼论“异化”的著作所打动，该著作强调内部关系，初版于1972年。不过，奥尔森后来采纳了语言学和唯心主义导向，这一点无论如何与我采取的历史的—地理的唯物主义立场都不一样。,"For those interested in the history of geographical thought, it is worth noting that Gunnar Olsson and I were both equally impressed with Oilman's book on Alienation and its emphasis on internal relations when it was first published in 1972, but that the linguistic and idealist direction in which Olsson subsequently took the idea is in all other respects quite at odds with my own work in historical-geographical materialism."
6564,或许因为同样的原因，巴斯卡(1993)在他付出了巨大努力和深刻思考的著作中展开了自己的辩证现实主义观点，他注意到自己和奥尔曼的著作之间具有某种交叉点，尽管他批评奥尔曼倾向于把辩证法理解成纯粹的认识论而不是一种有力的本体论立场。,"Perhaps for similar reasons Bhaskar (1993), in laying out his own version of dialectical realism in a book of intimidating difficulty and intensity, notes both a certain convergence between his own work and that of Oilman's, while criticizing Oilman for tending to treat dialectics as pure epistemology rather than as a powerful ontological position."
6565,在辩证的/关系的视野中，事实与价值之间的分离是不可能实现的(除非通过阴谋诡计，或者在某些极为有限的领域中。在这些领域中，人们合理地接受这个观念，即价值是或可能被视为恒定的)。,"In the dialectical/relational view, the separation of facts and values is impossible to achieve (except by sleight of hand or within certain strictly limited domains where it may reasonably be held that values are or can be held constant)."
6565,如我们所见，在某些科学领域中，这种必然融合事实和价值的辩证的/关系的观点已经开始复兴，例如，在“如何解释量子理论”这个问题上的广泛争论。,"In some areas of science, as we shall see, this dialectical/relational view of the inevitable fusion of facts and values has undergone a revival of sorts, as multiple contestations have arisen over, for example, how to interpret quantum theory."
6566,一类错误和二类错误与陈述假设的研究项目相关。,Type I and Type II errors are associated with research projects that state hypotheses.
6566,在研究项目的分析阶段，通过数据收集汇总，研究者能够进行假设检验。,"In the analytical phase of a research project, having aggregated the data, the researcher is able to test hypotheses."
6566,研究者使用的假设有许多的类型，主要包括零假设和备择假设。,"There are several types of hypotheses that the researcher uses, primarily the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis."
6567,就如同我们可以想象空间同特定身份相联系、排除或包容一样，我们同样可以把身份看成是因空间而形成和发挥作用的。,"Just as we can imagine spaces associated with, excluding or embracing particular identities, we can also see identity as spatially formed and enacted."
6567,"流散身份(diasporic identity)就是这样一种概念(见 Anderson, 1991; Gilroy, 1993)。","The idea of diasporic identity is one such idea (see Anderson, 1991; Gilroy, 1993)."
6567,"流散的意思指的是某一人群从他们发祥地扩散或分散出去，流散到各地。但是现在这个词出现了引申的用法，用来代表人们有多个地方作为归属地的复杂感受，他们可能把这些地方都看成是自己的家乡(Clifford, 1994)。","Diaspora literally refers to the dispersal or scattering of a population from an original homeland, but it is now used more loosely to capture the complex sense of belonging that people can have over several places, all of which they might think of as home (Clifford, 1994; see Mavroudi, 2007, for more on different the orizations of diaspora)."
6568,只要现代部门有不可耗尽的规模经济——这对整个论证至关重要——我们就必须将现代部门模型化为不完全竞争的部门。,"As long as there are unexhausted economies of scale in the modern sector, which are crucial to the whole argument, one must face up to the necessity of modeling the modern sector as imperfectly competitive."
6568,墨菲等人的模型，通过假设存在多个定价受到限制的垄断者来引入不完全竞争。,"In the Murphy et al. formulation, imperfect competition is dealt with by assuming a set of limit-pricing monopolists."
6568,尽管（我们很快会看到）它不是万能的，但用在这里还是一个不错的方法。,"This works well here, although (as we will see) it is not always an adequate device."
6569,调査者完成问卷调査同样可被细分为中途拦截式调查（intercept)和上门调査。,Interviewer-completed questionnaires can also be subdivided intointercept surveys and household interviews.
6569,针对旅游研究，这里有两种基本的中途拦截式调查类型：路访和现场调査（见本章后面的讨论）。,"Within tourism studies, there are essentially two types of intercept surveys: en-route surveys and on-site surveys (see discussion later in the chapter)."
6569,因为受访者是从一个活动中（Frey 1989)被中途拦截，所以这里使用“中途拦截调査”这一术语。这种情况既能发生在来往一个或多个目的地的旅游途中，也能发生在一个目的地的某点。,The term 'intercept' is used since the respondent is 'intercepted' in the course of an activity (Frey 1989) — in this case either travelling to or from a destination or several destinations or while on-site at a destination.
6570,上门调査收集的数据通常是有关旅游者对旅游和旅游产品及其未来发展的态度和意见方面的。,Household surveys usually collect data regarding attitudes and opinions about travel and tourism products and developments.
6570,它同时方便监控社会经济变化以及旅游趋势和方式。,They also facilitate the monitoring of changes in socioeconomic profiles and travel and tourism trends and patterns.
6570,上门调查的优缺点与自填式问卷调查和调查者完成问卷调查的一样。,The advantages and disadvantages of household surveys are the same as for interviewer completed and self-completion questionnaires.
6571,我们还要对莱恩·斯蒂芬森以及所有约翰·威利出版杜的成员所不断给予的帮助表示衷心地感谢。,We would like to give a great deal of thanks to lain Stevenson and everyone at John Wiley for their continued support.
6571,编辑们对南极旅游工作国际协会为允许前往南极的旅游者和旅游工作人员重新制定组织指导方针表示由衷感谢。,The editors would also like to give special thanks to the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) for permission to reproduce lAATO's guidelines for tour operators and visitors to Antarctica.
6571,最后，我们向所有为此项目提供帮助，做出贡献的所有同仁表达最诚挚的谢意，因为你们的无私奉献而使得研究工作得以顺利进行！,"Finally, we would like to thank ail the contributors for their support of the project and making the job of the editors that much easier."
6572,早期对旅游的研究即旅游研究主要是建立在数量计算和经济效益确定的基础上。,"Initially, the study of tourism — that is, tourism research — was predicated to the counting of numbers and the determination of economic benefits."
6572,这是因为旅游业这种服务性的产业在国内和国际层面上都被视为经济发展的工具，对于那些只有很少或根本没有基本的技术资源的地区或国家来说更是如此。,"This occurred because tourism, a service industry, was viewed as an economic development tool both at a national and international level, particularly for those regions or nations with minimal or no primary or technological resources."
6572,许多年来，振兴主义和经济传统(Getz 1987)是用于旅游发展规划的主要方法，而这两者都是以经济学范式为基础的。,"For many years, boosterism and the economic tradition (Getz 1987) were the predominant planning approaches adopted for tourism development.Both are founded on economic paradigms."
6573,原始资料或二手资料的使用取决于研究项目本身、使用的范式和一些外部因素诸如时间金钱等的限制。,"The use of primary or secondary data depends on the research project, the overlying paradigm and any external factors such as time and monetary constraints."
6573,对于旅游研究者来说，资料来源是很广泛的。,"For tourism researchers, data sources are extensive."
6573,原始资料可以通过观察法、访谈法、专家小组或问卷调查法等方式收集。,"Primary data may be gathered by using observation, interviews, panel groups or questionnaires."
6573,二手资料可以通过由私人、公共和非营利部门提供的文化文件和著作来收集。,"Secondary data may be gathered from cultural documents and artefacts accessible in the private, public and non-profit sectors."
6574,所有表格、图表和附录的标记都要清晰、简明地表达它们的内容。,"All labels for tables, graphs and appendices should clearly and succinctly describe their contents."
6574,例如：“旅游者数量”就不如“2000年南澳洲的洲际旅游者数量”传递的信息量更大。,"For example, 'Tourist numbers' is not as informative as 'Interstate tourist numbers in South Australia in 2000'."
6574,要注意， 一些表格和图表是可以脱离其背景而存在的，且可用于他处，这样，相应的标记和题目就要能够保证它们在脱离了原来的使用环境之后仍然是完整而切题的。,"Remember that some tables and graphs may be removed from their context and used elsewhere, so the labels or titles should enable them to stand alone from the document from which they were drawn."
6575,旅游组织既可以由公共部门的代表或私有部门的代表组成，或由公共部门的代表和私有部门的代表共同组成。,Tourism bodies may consist entirely of public or private representatives or a mixture of personnel from the public and private sectors.
6575,旅游组织可在本地、地区、州、国内或国际等不同的组织层面上运作（Mill and Morrison 1998)。,"They can also operate at several levels — local, regional, state, national or international ( Mill & Morrison 1998)."
6575,旅游组织对研究的要求与我们上面提到的几个部门对研究的要求基本相同。,The research requirements of tourism bodies are not dissimilar to those of the sectors noted above.
6576,表4-2列出了研究者对社会所承担的伦理责任。,Table 4.2 provides a checklist of the researcher's ethical responsibilities to Society.
6576,在使用这个表格的时候，如果回答与提示不同的话，就表明研究设计需要重新考虑伦理的问题。,"When using the checklist, if any responses differ from those indicated, then the research design needs to be reconsidered with respect to its ethical framework."
6576,在有的情况下，特别是对于那些贯穿（尽管并不绝对）批评理论范式或女性主义范式的研究更是如此。,"In some cases, there may be political ramifications, and this may be especially true of research informed by either (though not exclusively) a critical theory or feminist paradigm."
6576,如果研究涉及不同的政治流派，那么就有必要讨论研究的社会“利益”。,"If there are political ramifications, then there also needs to be some discussion regarding the social 'good' of the research."
6577,以《纽伦堡法典》、《人权宣言》和《赫尔辛基宣言》为基础，人们又制定了很多的伦理准则。,"Many codes of ethics are founded on the Nuremberg Code, the Universal Declaration of  Human Rights and the Declaration of Helsinki."
6577,保护个体的权利是道德和社会的责任，已经被西方世界公认，并且受国际准则和宣言的约束。,"The protection of individual rights is a moral and social responsibility that is internationally recognised in the Western world, and is guided by these international code and declarations."
6577,因此，研究者有责任确保他能保护作为被研究者的人类和非人类参与者的权利。,"Therefore, it is expected that every researcher has a responsibility to ensure that they protect the rights of individuals (and non-human subjects) participating in their research."
6578,数据的整理包括两种方式：可能编码式整理和逻辑整理(Babbie 1995)。,Data cleaning involves two types of cleaning — possible-code cleaning and contingency cleaning (Babbie 1995).
6578,"数据的整理是很有必要的，因为数据输入包含人员介入，不管人们在输入资料时如何地小心翼翼,但错误依然难以避免。",Cleaning data is necessary because of the fact that data entry involves humans and humans are prone to make errors despite their best intentions not to do so.
6578,数据输入中的错误一般是指编码员编排了错误的编码或调査对象犯了错误，如写了两个答案的编码而不是一个。,Errors in data entry are associated with coders assigning the wrong codes and respondents making mistakes such as coding two responses instead of only one.
6579,这种“马赛克”世界观在哈特向所处的时代就已经过时但依然存在。,
6579,,This ‘mosaic view’ of the world was already outliving its usefulness in Hartshorne’s time.
6579,到1940年代末，地方不再是孤立的这种情况逐渐变得清楚了，这就是向哈特向的“区域分异”观点提出挑战的事实。,"By the 1940s it was becoming clear that places were no longer isolated, a fact that posed a challenge to Hartshorne’s idea of ‘areal differentiation’."
6579,60年后，如卡斯特尔斯所认为的那样，在世界范围内地方之间的相互联系比以前任何时候都更紧密了。,"Over 60 years later, places worldwide are, as Castells argues, more intimately interlinked than ever before."
6580,他们的一般性理论作为环境变化后弹性与适应性循环的模式而出现。,Their general theory emerges as a model of the cycle of resilience and adaptation following change.
6580,这可以想象为麦比乌斯带(Mobius strip)随时间变化的轨迹，如图7.4所示。,"This is envisaged as a Mobius strip trajectory through time, as shown in Figure 7."
6580,如果我们从条带左下方一次扰动(比如打击)开始，新情况的特征是有机体的重组和短期的外貌或向外扩展——先锋期(或生态学上的r相)。,"4. If we start following a major perturbation (say a shock) at the bottom left of the strip, the new situation is characterized by reorganization and the transient appearance or expansion of organisms – the pioneer stage (or r-phase in ecology)."
6581,这就意味着要研究发展理论，你必须有勇气犯错误，为了得出令人信服的非凡见解，写模型时必须不拘小节。,"This means that to do development theory, one must have the courage to be silly, writing down models that are implausible in the details in order to arrive at convincing higher-level insights."
6581,这不是什么新教训。,This is not a new lesson.
6581,大约十几年前贸易理论家们就碰到了这个问题，他们发现为了重建贸易理论，要考虑报酬递增，必须不能受所谓普遍性的约束；几年后增长理论家们得到了同样的教训。,"Trade theorists learned it more than a dozen years ago, when they realized that a reconstruction of trade theory to take account of increasing returns would necessarily involve abandoning all pretense of generality; growth theorists learned the same lesson a few years later."
6582,描述性统计能够使调查人员以数字术语来描述收集的原始数据（Neuman 2000，p.317)。,"Descriptive statistics enable researchers to describe the aggregation of raw data in numerical terms (Neuman 2000, p. 317)."
6582,描述性统计包括使用单变量分析、双变量分析及多变量分析。,"Descriptive statistics involve the use of univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis."
6582,这些分析方法包括使用频数分布、百分比表格以及集中趋势量数。,"These methods of analysis incorporate the use of frequency distributions, percentage tables and measures of central tendency."
6583,第一张是乔治•埃尔加•希克斯（George Elgar Hicks）绘制的一幅图画，题为“古老英格兰的原动力”(图4.1)。该画表现一家人，站在家庭与外部世界之间的门槛上。,The first is a painting called ‘The sinews of old England’ by George Elgar Hicks (Figure 4.1).It shows a family positioned on the threshold between home and world.
6583,这幅画及其题目以明晰的形象化语言表现出英国的民族特性，即力量与工作的中心是男人。,The title and the painting represent English national identity in clearly embodied terms that centre on the strength and work of the man.
6584,术语“在位”和“出位”源自人类学学科领域，尤其是与民族志的定性方法的研究工具相关。,The terms 'emic' and 'etic' are founded in the discipline of anthropology and are especially associated with the qualitative methodological tool of ethnography.
6584,"民族志是“描述某一群体或者某一文化的艺术和科学”（Fetterman 1989, p. 11)。","Ethnography is 'the art and science of describing a group or culture' (Fetterman 1989, p. 11)."
6584,"派克（Pike）（1954）最早创造了在位和出位这两个术语（Pelto & Pelto 1978, p. 54）。","Pike (1954) is credited with coining the terms emic and etic (Pelto & Pelto 1978, p. 54)."
6585,民族志报告的显著特点是运用了大量描述（Geertz 1973)和逐字引述 (Fetterman 1989)。,The distinguishing features of ethnographic reports are the use of thickdescriptions (Geertz 1973) and verbatim quotations (Fetterman 1989).
6585,报告还采用“民族志的现在”（the ethnographic present)及研究者的角色或研究者的“社会立场”（social situatedness) (Fetterman 1989)等方法。,Ethnographic reports also use 'the ethnographic present' and the role of the researcher or the researcher's 'social situatedness' is also presented (Fetterman 1989).
6585,大量的描述使民族志学者为读者清晰地再现了所研究的现象，这些描述都来自于野外记录和转录。,Thick descriptions enable the ethnographer to recreate the phenomenon being studied with clarity for the reader.Thick descriptions are developed from field notes and transcriptions.
6586,“明智利用”运动事实上利用了环境激进主义的长期传统—虽然正如我们将要看到的那样，它利用的是一种非常特殊的传统。,"The ""wise use"" movement draws in fact on a long tradition of environmental activism – though, as we shall see, of a very special sort."
6586,“明智利用”这个术语的运用并非机会主义反对政府干预或调控的修辞手法。,"The appropriation of the term ""wise use"" is not merely an opportunistic rhetorical device with which to counter any form of governmental intervention or regulation."
6586,这个传统来源于古典自由主义理论，特别是那些通常归之于洛克的理论，以及它们向政治—经济实践的转化，特别是在具有杰斐逊式民主传统的美国。,"The tradition has its origins in classical liberal theories, particularly those generally attributed to Locke, and their translation into political–economic practices most particularly in the United States with its tradition of Jeffersonian democracy."
6587,经济地理学——活动在空间的区位——显然是一门具有重要实际意义的学科，学术界应该会对它很有兴趣。,Economic geography---the location of activity in space---is a subject of obvious practical importance and presumably of considerable intellectual interest.
6587,但在整个标准的经济学理论中儿乎完全看不到它的身影。,Yet it is almost completely absent from the standard corpus of economic theory.
6587,在过去的几年中，我的主要目标就是用我所知道的惟一的方式来补救这种遗漏，也就是构建巧妙且有说服力的模型，以吸引更多的学生和同仁来研究经济地理学。,"My main objective over the past few years has been to remedy that omission the only way I know how: by producing clever, persuasive models that in turn help inspire students and colleagues to work on the subject."
6588,这个任务完全不同于小城镇或郊区的街道和人行道应有的用途。,This task is totally unlike any service that sidewalks and streets in little towns or true suburbs are called upon to do.
6588,大城市不是小城镇，区别不仅仅在于比其更大，也不是郊区，区别不在于比其更稠密。,"Great cities are not like towns, only larger.They are not like suburbs, only denser."
6588,它们有着一些基本的不同，其中之一是城市顾其思义有着许许多多的陌生人。,"They differ from towns and suburbs in basic ways, andone of these is that cities are by definition full of strangers."
6588,对任何一个人而言，在大城市中碰到的陌生人比他认识的人要多得多，不仅在公共场所如此，更为常见的是在家门口。,"To any one person, strangers are far more commmon in big cities than acquintances.More common not just in places of public assembly, but more common at a man's own doorstep."
6589,原始资料最重要的优点是该资料是为了研究者当前项目的特定目的而收集的。,The key advantage of primary data is that the data have been collected for the specific purposes of the researcher's current project.
6589,所以，如果信息收集过程严格遵循相关的科学规则和程序的话，该信息就将具有一定的相关性和及时性。,"Subsequently, if the relevant scientific guidelines and protocols have been followed correctly, the data will have relevance and recency."
6589,原始资料收集也使研究者直接面向研究所需要的具体的目标群体（或研究单元)，而不像在使用二手信息时可能通过扩大、缩减或调整目标群体(或研究单元）而做出妥协。,"Primary data collection also enables the researcher to target the specific population (study units) desired for the study rather than making compromises by widening, narrowing or adjusting the target population or study units as sometimes occurs when using secondary data sources."
6590,纯理论或基础性的研究增进了我们对世界的了解。,Pure or basic research advances our knowledge of the world.
6590,"在旅游学领域里，这类理论或理论框架包括：目的地生命周期理论（Butler 1980)、德克西（Doxey)的恼怒指数（irridex)模型（1975)、克劳森（Clawson)的休闲体验理论（1963)(后来被奇利安（1992)修正用以说明旅行体验），以及推—拉动机模式等准理论，例如我们所看到的戴恩(Darm, 1977)和格雷（Gray, 1970)的追求漫游（wanderlust)与追求阳光（sunlust)的分类方法。","In the field of tourism, examples of theories or theoretical constructs include the destination life cycle (Butler 1980), Doxey's irridex (1975), Clawson's recreation experience (1963), which was later modified by Killion (1992) to demonstrate the travel experience, and the quasi-theoretical push-pull motivation models (see, for example, Dann (1977) or Gray's (1970) wanderlust and sunlust classification)."
6590,纯理论研究耗费时间并提出比较宽泛的结论，而这些结论很可能并不直接应用于旅游业。,Pure research takes time and addresses broad issues that may have no immediate application by the tourism industry.
6591,目录页需列出以下几项：报告摘要（executive summary)、序言/前言、致谢、表格和图表目录、章节标题、参考文献和附录。,"The contents page lists the following items: executive summary, preface/foreword, acknowledgments, list of tables and list of figures, chapters, subsections, references and appendices."
6591,从报告摘要到致谢部分需要使用罗马数字标注页码。,Roman numerals are used for pages from the executive summary through to the acknowledgments section.
6591,目录页不必列在其中，但各章要分成多个小节(参见图10-6)。,"The contents page itself is not listed on the contents page, and chapters are organised into subsections (see figure 10.6)."
6592,对于住宅市场而言，住宅的耐久性具有三重含义。,The durability of housing has three implications for the housing market.
6592,首先，业主通过花钱维修或维护，可以降低住宅物理性折旧的速度。,"First, the landlord can control the rate of physical deterioration by spending money on repair and maintenance."
6592,其次，每年市场上都有大量的二手住宅出售。,"Second, there is a large supply of used housing on the market every year."
6593,社会学家倾向于使用“内容分析”这一术语，历史学家则使用“档案研究”，哲学家和文学专业的学生使用“文本分析”或“文学批评”。,"Sociologists tend to use the term 'content analysis', historians the term 'archival research', and philosophers and students of literature the term 'textual analysis' or 'literary criticism'."
6593,不同学科也将不同的解释框架应用到文化作品分析当中来。,Different disciplines also apply different interpretive frameworks to the analysis of cultural artefacts.
6593,"话语分析、修辞分析和解构是考察文本时也会提到的术语（Reinharz 1992, p. 148)。","Discourse analysis, rhetoric analysis, and deconstruction are additional terms that refer to the examination of texts (Reinharz 1992, p. 148)."
6594,"对地理学家来说,这一框架中最广为人知的是关于日常生活的时间地理学，它由特斯腾•哈格斯特朗提出并给予了详细说明。",The best-known element of this framework to geographers is the time–geography of daily life that has been elaborated by Torsten Hägerstrand.
6594,他的基本模型描述了日常个人活动的空间制约和时间制约，说明了人们为了达到特定目的（或“计划”）而从一个地方 (或“停留点”）向另一个地方移动而产生时空间“路径”的方式。,"His basic model captures the constraints of space and time on daily, individual spatial practices.It illustrates the way that people trace out ‘paths’ in time and space, moving from one place (or‘station’) to another in order to fulfil particular purposes (or ‘projects’)."
6594,通过三种制约的界定而将这种移动概念化：（1)能力制约（capability constrains)——主要的制约，受可用移动时间以及可用交通方式速度的限制；（2)权威制约（authority constrains) 制度和习俗对移动和可达性的影响；（3)组合制约（coupling constrains) 限定时段内必须完成某特定计划而产生的制约。,"This movement is conceptualized as being circumscribed by three kinds of constraint: (1) capability constraints – principally, the time available for travelling and the speed of the available mode of transportation, (2) authority constraints --- laws andcustoms affecting travel and accessibility, and (3) coupling constraints --- resulting from the limited periods during which specific projects are available for access."
6595,与城市社会地理相关的一个主要现象是在欧洲和北美工业化核心地带的许多城市和城市地区出现了逆工业化（deindustrializatimi)。,One of the major outcomes in relation to urban social geography has been the deindustrialization of many of the cities and urban regions of the industrial heartlands in Europe and North America.
6595,另一个现象是大都市地区中制造业和服务业就业岗位的加速分散化（decentralization)。,Another has been the accelerated decentralization of both manufacturing and service employment within metropolitan regions.
6595,第三个现象是一小部分特大城市变成了“世界城市”(也称作全球城市），它们在专业化信息和知识的生产、处理与贸易中日益专业化（见第二章）。,"A third has been the transformation of a few of the largest cities into world cities (also termed global cities) specializing in the production, processing and trading of specialized information and intelligence (see Chapter 2)."
6595,第四个现象是髙等级的生产者服务业就业岗位的再集中化（recentralization)。,And a fourth has been the recentralization of high-order producer-service employment.
6596,我们现在需要谈论的是这种方法中一些具有普遍意义的因素。,All that we need to talk about now are a few general aspects of the approach.
6596,我想像一个由几个分离的区位构成的经济。,I imagine an economy with a number of separate locations.
6596,（地区连续分布的情况也可以处理；事实上，讨论在一个连续的空间经济中的聚集现象有一些非常有趣的方法，不过此处我略过不谈。,"(It is possible to deal with a continuum of locations as well; indeed, there are some very interesting ways of looking at agglomeration in a continuous spatial economy, but I won't go into them here.)"
6596,）有两个部门：农业，它的地理位置固定不变，和制造业，它的地理位置随时间推移而变化。,"There are two sectors: agriculture, which is geographically immobile, and manufacturing, which is mobile over time."
6597,52个地理学专业组织中，其中有些受到新方法的影响很大，有些受到的影响则较小。,"Some of the 52 geographies have been much affected by the new methods, while others have been little affected."
6597,后者中较典型的是新形成的女权主义地理学和地理学思想史的研究。,The latter were typified by the newly wrought genre of feminist geography and studies in the history of geographical thought.
6597,这些后面还要作简要的介绍。,These are briefly introduced below.
6598,"在植物群落和动物群落数据中进行格局研究，通常包括多元分析法的应用（Kent and Coker, 1992; Waite, 2000）。","The search for pattern in plant and animal community data routinely involves the application of multivariate analysis (Kent and Coker, 1992; Waite, 2000)."
6598,"正如盖特里尔（Gatrell, 1983）所指出的，生物学家业已设计出无数(不)相似系数，用以评估群落组成样本之间匹配的程度（degree of matching）。","As Gatrell (1983) points out, numerous (dis)similarity coefficients have been devised by ecologists to assess the degree of matching between samples of community composition, often described as ‘ecological distance’."
6598,"其中许多具有“公制”的性质（即基于欧几里得空间概念）——丝毫不是欧氏距离系数本身（Kent and Coker, 1992; Waite, 2000）。","Many of these are described as having ‘metric’ properties (i.e.they are based on concepts of Euclidean space) – not least the coefficient of Euclidean distance itself (Kent and Coker, 1992; Waite, 2000)."
6599,但是，没有什么证据能够表明通过INBio挣来的300万美元中有任何一点用在了哥斯达黎加的土著人保留地上。,"However, there’s little evidence that any of the $5 million earned through INBio has made its way into Costa Rica’s native reserves."
6599,这个国家的土著人被禁锢在一种没有给他们多少权力或机会的政治组织中，他们被排除在INBio的活动之外就能说明问题。,"The country’s indigenous peoples are locked in a political structure that offers them little power or opportunity, and their exclusion from INBio’s operation illustrates this graphically."
6599,另外，他们所居住的位置从地方来看远离哥斯达黎加的政治权力中心，即首都，这就使他们的声音更难以被听到。,"On top of this, their physical location in places distant from the capital city, the centre of political authority in Costa Rica, makes it doubly difficult to be heard."
6600,批评理论范式植根于卡尔•马克思（Karl Marx)的著作。这种理论认为，从事科学研究的必要性在于将受压迫群体从压迫下解放出来，并因而改变其社会环境。,The critical theory paradigm is grounded in the work of Karl Marx and the need to conduct research that will free oppressed groups from oppression and thereby change their social circumstances.
6600,"批评理论与解释社会学范式有某种共同之处,但却与实证主义不同。",Critical theory has synergies with the interpretive social sciences paradigm but not with positivism.
6601,直方图是由彼此挨着的垂直长方条构成的。,Histograms are graphs with vertical bars adjoining each other.
6601,连接这些长方条的中点，就能够制成频数的折线图。,These can be made into a frequency polygon by joining the midpoints of the bars.
6601,地图绘制法在地图上描述频数，形象地确定了所描述变量的位置和重要性（Sanmtakos 1998）。,Cartographs demonstrate frequencies on a map to visually identify the location and magnitude of the variable being represented (Sarantakos 1998).
6602,单变量分析是一次只对一个变量进行的分析。,Univariate analysis involves the analysis of one variable at one time.
6602,单变量分析很容易通过描述与变量相关的频数分布来实现。,This is easily achieved by representing the frequency distribution associated with a variable.
6602,频数分布可以使用本章以前所讨论的数据输入及编码的任一方法来实现。,Frequency distributions can be developed using any of the methods of data entry and coding discussed previously in this chapter.
6602,从本质上讲，频数分布描述了答案选项中与每个种类相关的答案的数量。,"Essentially, the frequency distribution portrays the number of responses associated with each of the categories in a response set."
6602,频数分布能够用于定类、定序及定距测量层次的变量。,"Frequency distributions can be used with variables measured at the nominal, ordinal and interval level."
6603,评价性研究主要是应用研究而非构建理论的研究，因为研究者的兴趣在于确定策略、实践活动、计划和法律机制改进的效果。,"Evaluative research is primarily applied research rather than theory-building research, as the researcher is interested in determining the outcomes of changes in strategies, practices and planning, and legislative mechanisms."
6603,评价性研究可能是以总结性或过程性的评价(summative evaluation & formative evaluation)为基础。,Evaluative research may be based on either summative or formative evaluation strategies.
6603,过程性评价通常是在一项活动的进行当中实施的，而总结性评价主要是在这项活动的尾声进行， 它的目的是为了确定某策略的成败，或者意在引入一项变革机制或行动。,"Formative evaluation is undertaken as an ongoing activity, whereas summative evaluation is primarily undertaken at the end of the process to determine the success or otherwise of a strategy or the introduction of a change mechanism or activity."
6603,评价性研究依赖于定量、定性或混合的研究方法。,"Evaluative research draws on quantitative, qualitative or mixed method methodologies."
6604,R. J. 乔利（1962）是第一位在地理学研究团体中引入系统理论，即“地貌学”和普遍系统论”的学者。,R. J. Chorley (1962) was first to bring systems theory before the geographical community with “Geomorphology and General Systems Theory.”
6604,在美国，爱德华A.阿克曼被认为是第二次世界大战之后第一位指出系统研究正在整个科学界兴起的学者。,In America Edward A. Ackerman was arguably the first geographer to point to the rise of systems research throughout the scientific world after World War II.
6604,阿克曼认为，所有的科学都关注着四个“压倒一切”的问题。,"All science, said Ackerman, is concerned with four “overriding” problems."
6605,在思考与澳大利亚有关的主要二手资料信息来源之前，我们应该先讨论一下统计资料的运用尤其是人口普查资料运用的缺点。,"Before moving on to consider key sources of secondary data relevant to the Australian setting, some additional disadvantages of working with statistical data, especially census data, should be discussed."
6605,读者可能想知道哪些人口普査资料与旅游研究有关。,You may be wondering what census data have to do with tourism research.
6605,人口普查资料是全国性的资料库，它可以为研究者提供全国性的人口统计信息。,Census data are national data sets that provide researchers with information about the national population.
6605,所收集资料的范围有很多项目，包括性别、年龄、宗教信仰、婚姻状况、国籍、出生地、目前居住地、教育背景和资质、雇用情况、居住细节、收人和车辆拥有状况等。,"The data collected span many criteria, including gender, age, religious affiliation, marital status, nationality, birthplace, current place of residence, educational background and qualifications, employment details, dwelling details, income and vehicle ownership."
6606,当目标读者为普通公众时，报告就应尽量使用简单易懂的语言，避免出现晦涩的术语和冗长的叙述。,"For the general public, the language used needs to be easily understood, soyour text should be free from jargon and wordy statements."
6606,第八章关于问题设计的相关要求也可应用于此：尽量使用简单精练的语言，避免使用技术性或模棱两可的术语。,The directionsnoted in chapter 8 for question design also apply here: use simple and succinct language and avoid technical or ambiguous terms.
6606,在为普通公众编写报告时，语言水平应与普通报纸所使用的语言水平大致相当。,"In preparingreports for the general public, the level of the language should be equivalent to the language level in most tabloid newspapers."
6606,而拥有技术知识的特殊利益集团可能要求更具技术性、内容更为翔实的论文。,Special interest groups with technical knowledge may require more technical and detailed texts.
6606,但这绝不是指普通公众缺乏语言技能。,This is not to suggest that the general public have poor language skills.
6606,当然，提供这些指导是为了通过适当阅读水平和清晰明确的语言风格帮助作者获得报告的最大覆盖面。,"Rather, these guidelines are offered to help you gain the maximum coverage for your report by ensuring that the reading level is appropriate and that the language is clear and unambiguous."
6607,要理解这种“反常的”行为，我们或许可以做这样一种分析，即，把城市的用地分成两种形式。第一种形式可以称为是普通用地(general land )，主要是为步行的普通大众的人群的流动之用。,"It helps to understand this ""perverse"" behavior if, in our minds, we divide all of the land of a city into two types.The first type, which can be called general land, is used for general public circulation by people on foot."
6607,在这些用地上，人们可以自由行走，自己选择，想到哪儿就到哪儿。,"It is land over which people move freely, and by choice, on their way from here to yonder,and from yonder back again."
6607,这包括街道、一些小的公园，有时候也包括一些建筑的走廊区，这些地方可以用做街道，供人们自由行走。,"It includes the streets,many of thesmaller parks, and sometimes it includes the lobbies of buildings when they are used freely as streets."
6608,知情同意要求正在进行研究的参与者们完全知晓此研究的性质。,Informed consent requires that research participants are fully apprised ofthe nature of the research in which they are participating.
6608,当参与者被研究活动的某些方面所蒙蔽时，就等于出现欺骗。,Deception occurs when participants are deceived about some aspect of the research.
6608,举个例子来说，发起人的真实身份被伪装，或者用一些含糊的术语来表述整个研究的目的，或故意扭曲研究目的。,"For example, the true identity of the sponsor may be masked or the overall research purpose may be couched in ambiguous terms or purposefully misrepresented."
6608,发生此种欺骗行为的原因，通常前提是研究参与者们已熟悉发起人的真实身份或研究的真正意图，继而他们的反应就会受到这种认识的影响。,"The reason for such deception is usually based on the premise that had the participants been made aware of the real identity of sponsor or the purpose of the research, then their responses would have been influenced by that knowledge."
6608,这种欺骗行为，一定要经研究同行、科学研究团体和道德评价团体认可。,"Deception of this nature must be approved by research peers, the scientific community and/or ethics review panels."
6608,道德评价团体负责审核从事研究的道德许可申请。,Ethics review panels are involved in reviewing applications for ethical clearance for the undertaking of research.
6609,“启发式询问的独特之处在于它特别注重研究者个人的经验、感受以及洞察力”（Patton 1990，P.72）。,"The uniqueness of heuristic inquiry is the extent to which it legitimizes and places at the fore [the] personal experiences, reflections, and insights of the researcher' (Patton 1990, p. 72)."
6609,启发式研究的过程包括6个阶段：事先约定、逐步进入、深思熟虑、阐述、详细解释以及创造性地综合（Moustakas 1990）。,"The process of heuristic research involves six phases: initial engagement, immersion, incubation, illumination, explication and creative synthesis (Moustakas 1990)."
6609,"启发式研究所用的方法包括口头访谈、半结构化访谈、标准化的开放式访谈（Moustakas 1990, P. 47）。","Methods used in heuristic research include conversational interviews, semi-structured interviews and standardised open-ended interviews (Moustakas 1990, p. 47)."
6609,"访谈法也需要个人资料作为补充，比如期刊报道或个人的日记（Moustakas 1990,p.49）。","Interviews are also supplemented with the use of personal documents such as journals and diaries (Moustakas 1990, p. 49)."
6610,空间为全部有关社会过程的元理论规定了不可驯服的残余。,Space defines the untamable residual to all metatheories of the social process.
6610,这些非常强烈的主张值得我们批判性详察。,These are very strong claims that deserve critical scrutiny.
6610,它们预示了这个问题，如何理解有关行动和社会决定问题的差异地理学和理论化的空间性。,"They presage the question of how to understand the geography of difference, the spatiality of theorizations, in relation to the issues of agency and social determination."
6610,例如，诺尔-塞替(1994)指出，社会学中的某种运动““暗示着同启蒙运动思想的决裂”，“否定了许多同现代联系在一起的既定特点” 。,"Here, for example, is Knorr-Cetina's (1994) description of those movements within sociology that ""imply a rupture with Enlightenment thinking"" and ""a negation of many of the definitive features that have been associated with the modern."""
6611,对环境的动态部分历来存在争议，表示气候学的空间单位是气团及其数不清的各种性质以及表征气团间边界特征的锋。,"As arguably dealing with the most dynamic part of the environment, the spatial units of climatology are represented by air masses and their numerous different characteristics and the fronts that characterize the boundaries between them."
6611,气团和锋二者在空间和时间上均处于永恒变化之中。,Both air masses and fronts are constantly changing in space and time.
6611,"不过，地球上主要气团和锋带业已得到充分认识(Briggs et al., 1997; Barry and Choley, 1998; Goudie, 2001)。","Nevertheless, the major air mass and frontal zones of the planet are widely recognized (Briggs et al., 1997; Goudie, 2001; Smithson et al., 2002; Barry, 2003)."
6612,下面是来自气象学的另一个例子。,Here's another story from meteorology.
6612,民间传说认为你可以根据天空的状况预测未来的天气，而且声称某种云朵预示着风暴即将到来。,"Folk wisdom has always said that you can predict future weather from the aspect of the sky, and had claimed that certain kinds of clouds presaged storms."
6612,然而，随着19世纪和20世纪早期气象学的发展，即随着一些重大的发现，如在一次风暴中，风沿环形的路径吹等——民间传说完全不了解这些知识——人们基本上不再注意天空的状况。,"As meteorology developed in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, however, as it made such fundamental discoveries, completely unknown to folk wisdom, as the fact that the winds in a storm blow in a circular path, it basically stopped paying attention to how the sky looked."
6613,关于增加公路容量既不能减少交通拥挤，也不能提高高峰期行车速度的说法有很多种。,There are many anecdotes about increases in highway capacity that did not result in less congestion and faster travel during the rush hour.
6613,原因在于高峰期行车的需求是高弹性的，最初很多通勤者因交通拥挤公路的速度慢而放弃。,"The reason is that the demand for rush-hour travel is highly elastic, with many commuters initially deterred from using the congested highway because of slow travel speeds."
6613,这就是“潜在需求”现象。,"This is the phenomenon of ""latent demand."""
6614,(1)建构任何种类的知识，“绘制空间”的话语行为都是先决条件。,"1. The discursive activity of ""mapping space"" is a fundamental prerequisite to the structuring of any kind of knowledge."
6614,离开对情境、区位和位置在其中发生的空间的绘制，任何有关“情境性”、“区位”和“位置性”的谈论都是无意义的。,"All talk about ""situatedness,"" ""location and positionality"" is meaningless without a mapping of the space in which those situations, locations, and positions occur."
6614,而且，不管空间绘制是比喻的还是真实的，这都同样正确。,And this is equally true no matter whether the space being mapped is metaphorical or real.
6615,首先考虑我的模型中经济在某一时刻的情况，也就是说给定制造业在空间上的分布时的情况。,"Consider first a snapshot of my model economy at a point in time, which is to say with some given distribution of manufacturing across space."
6615,当然，我们会发现制造业选择其中一些区位比另一些区位更有利。,"We will, of course, find that some locations are more desirable for manufacturing than others."
6615,而且，不难发现可以用一个地点的市场潜力指数来衡量该地点是否理想，这个指数虽然比社会物理学家用的指数复杂得多，但仍能看得出来它们是有关系的。,And we will not be surprised to find that the desirability of sites can be measured by a market potential index that is rather more complicated than the ones used by the social physicists but still recognizably related.
6616,“动态平衡”包括因不断侵蚀而导致的渐进性地形发育。,A ‘dynamic equilibrium’ involves progressive evolution of landform as a response to ongoing erosion.
6616,很多能够影响区域尺度地貌的重大气候变化也是在这种时间尺度上进行的——例如，整个大陆冰盖的进退。,"This is also the timescale at which major changes in climate can affect landforms at the regional scale – for example, advances and retreats of  ice sheets over entire continents."
6616,乔利等(Chorley et al.，1984)深入讨论了地貌中的尺度问题，而索恩斯(Thornes)则详细探讨了时间问题。,"Chorley et al. (1984) provide further discussion of the scale issue in geomorphology, while time is discussed in more detail by Thornes."
6617,"学界并没有一部统一的“地理学”史，只有林林总总、令人眼花缭乱的不同版本,彼此差异很大，而且往往是百家争鸣。","There is no single history of ‘geography’, only a bewildering variety of different, often competing versions of the past."
6617,因为地理学本身就处在不断变化之中：从现代早期（early-modern)的航海，到18世纪启蒙运动的地理探险，再到19世纪晚期的“新”地理学，直至两次世界大战之间的区域地理学。,One such interpretation charts the transition from early-modern navigation to Enlightenment exploration to the ‘new’ geography of the late nineteenth century and the regional geography of the interwar period.
6617,本文所述的种种——就像所有其他地理学史一样——只不过反映了作者的偏好。,This contextualist account – like all other histories of geography – reflects the partialities of its author.
6618,在第一次世界大战的几年中，1914年以前出现的“新”地理学已经发展为一门复杂而通俗的学科，在各级教育系统中都很突出。,"By the interwar years, the ‘new’ geography that had arisen before 1914 had evolved into a sophisticated and popular discipline, prominent at all levels in the educational system."
6618,大学里产生了众多的二级学科，其中许多延续至今，唯二次大战之间有两种倾向值得一提。,"In the universities, a host of new subdisciplines arose, most of which continue to the present, but two wider interwar trends are worthy of special mention."
6618,其一是坚信地理学应该是一门综合性的区域科学。,"The first was the conviction that geography should be an integrative, regional science."
6619,在时间序列分析中，用技术去除小尺度的噪声（系统输出中的快速波动），借以强调像周期性循环和趋势这样的大尺度格局，以及像重大干扰或阈值改变这样的事件。,"In time-series analysis, techniques are applied to remove small-scale noise (rapid fluctuations in system output) in order to emphasize larger-scale patterns such as periodic cycles, trends, major perturbations and threshold changes."
6619,趋势面分析也被应用到空间研究中，用点状尺度的数据来归纳区域格局。,"Trend-surface analysis has been applied in spatial studies too, generalizing regional patterns from point-scale data."
6619,这两种情况下滤波器都要留下某种频率的成分而排除其他频率。,"In both cases, the filter passes components of certain frequencies while excluding others."
6620,由于以上这五种原因，如果认为全球化就等于同一化和均质化就是一种误解。,"For the five reasons mentioned above, it is simply misconceived to think that globalization equals sameness and homogeneity."
6620,相反，人文地理学家已经证明地方之间的联系越多，地方之间的差异就越多，并会被改造。,"On the contrary, human geographers have shown that the more linked places become, the more place differences endure and are remade."
6620,"在斯温盖道（Swyngedouw, 1989）新创造的词汇中，我们需要少谈论一些全球化，多谈论一些不平衡的“全球本土化”进程 。","In Swyngedouw’s (1989) apt neologism, we need to talk less about globalization and more about an uneven process of ‘glocalization’."
6621,需要研究的第二个问题是将一个尺度的分析结果应用到不同尺度上去。,The second question relates to the need to apply the results of one scale of analysis at different scales.
6621,这涉及把结果从小尺度到大尺度的尺度放大——例如把小流域的研究结果推广到大河流域。,"This may involve upscaling of results from smaller to larger areas – for example, extending results from small catchment studies to large river basins."
6621,也可能在有些情况下是尺度缩小——例如，将通用循环模型（全球尺度）的结果应用到某个区域。,"It may also in some circumstances involve downscaling – for example, applying the results of general circulation models (global scale) to particular regions."
6622,这些东西的出现绝非一日之功，而是渐进的标准化与协同研究的对象，历经几个世纪才得以投入使用。,They didn’t suddenly come into existence over night but were the subject of progressive standardizations and co-ordinations that have taken centuries to put into place.
6622,而且此类事物还需海量的投资。,And they required extraordinary investments too.
6622,它们需要研制专门化设备，能够在相同地点测量相同的事物，今天基于卫星的全球定位系统（GPS）就是其最终产物。,"They required the invention of specialized devices that could measure the same things at the same places, culminating in today’s satellite-based global positioning system (GPS)."
6623,话语表达人类思想、幻想和欲望。,"Discourses express human thought, fantasy, and desire."
6623,它们也在制度上依据于、在物质上受制于、在经验上植根于社会和权力关系的表现形式。,"They are also institutionally based, materially constrained, experientially grounded manifestations of social and power relations."
6623,因为同样的原因，话语的效果充满并浸透了社会过程中的所有其他环节(例如，影响信仰、实践，并被它们影响)。,"By the same token, discursive effects suffuse and saturate all other moments within the social process (affecting, for example, beliefs and practices as well as being affected by them)."
6624,然而，《人口原理》第一版被先验普遍原则的演绎强有力地歪曲了。那个原则主张，食物对于人的生存是必要的，两性之间的激情是必需的和永恒的。,Yet the first edition of the Essay is strongly colored by deduction from a priori universal principles: namely that food is necessary to the existence of man and that the passion between the sexes is necessary and constant.
6624,他把这两个基本原理置于资源有限性的世界语境中，并推论出著名的“自然法”:人口增长(几何序列)对生存手段(代数扩张)的压力不可避免地产生贫穷、疾病、饥荒、战争以及“人口过剩”的普遍趋势。,"He places these two postulates in the context of a world of finite resources and deduces the famous ""natural law"" in which population growth (a geometric series) places pressure on the means of subsistence (an arithmetic expansion) inevitably producing poverty, disease, famine, war, and a general tendency towards ""overpopulation."""
6625,人口普查资料是全国性的资料库，它可以为研究者提供全国性的人口统计信息。,Census data are national data sets that provide researchers with information about the national population.
6625,所收集资料的范围有很多项目，包括性别、年龄、宗教信仰、婚姻状况、国籍、出生地、目前居住地、教育背景和资质、雇用情况、居住细节、收入和车辆拥有状况等。,"The data collected span many criteria, including gender, age, religious affiliation, marital status, nationality, birthplace, current place of residence, educational background and qualifications, employment details, dwelling details, income and vehicle ownership."
6625,这些信息可以帮助旅游研究者确定旅游目的地社区人口的社会经济特征，还有助于市场营销中的市场细分，特别是制订广告战略。,"This information can assist tourism researchers in determining the sociodemographics of host communities at (potential) tourism destinations.It can provide information concerning population characteristics that can then be used in developing market segments to assist with marketing, particularly advertising strategies."
6626,但是，可以从这样几个方面对这种方法提出批评，包括把几个不同方面的剥夺指标进行合并的必要性和在总体指数中给它们以同样权重的正确性（参看对生活质量指标的讨论）。,"This kind of approach can be criticized on several grounds, however, including the desirability of aggregating indicators of several different aspects of deprivation and the validity of assigning them equal weight in the overall index (recall the discussion of quality-of-life indicators)."
6626,还需要注意预防人类生态学方法错误（ecological fallacy)的危险（即用以人的集合体为基础的数据对个人作出推断）。,It is also necessary to guard against the dangers of the ecological fallacy (i.e.making inferences about individuals with data based on aggregates of people).
6626,因此并不是每个居住在贫困区的人都是受到剥夺的，也并不是每个处于“多重剥夺”地区的贫困人口都必然是受多重剥夺的。,Thus not everyone in a deprived area is necessarily deprived and not every deprived person in an area of ‘multiple deprivation’ is necessarily multiply deprived.
6627,在20世纪，地理学在总体上，特别是人文地理学，已经与主要学术生活部门一起进入各大学之中。,"Geography in general, and human geography in particular, has moved among the major divisions of academic life within universities over the last century."
6627,1970年代以前，罕有人文地理学家认为自己的专业属于社会科学，20年以后，他们中大多数人改变了看法。,"Before the 1970s, very few human geographers identified their discipline as a social science: two decades later, most did."
6627,这种转变既不是“自然的”，也不一定是明显的，而是该学科的身份与“社会科学”想把地理学家纳入其轨道的意愿之间的矛盾造成的。,That shift was neither ‘natural’ nor necessarily obvious: it resulted from conflicts over the discipline’s identity and over the willingness of ‘the social sciences’ to accept geographers within their orbit.
6628,人文地理学通常因其多样的热烈争论而引人瞩目。这些争论并非仅集中于人文地理学的主题上，而是更多地集中在人文地理学的哲学上，即其主题的倾向上，最近几十年来尤其如此。人文地理学者们由于涉足自然科学尤其是社会科学而正面临着哲学领域内的争辩。,"Human geography is currently characterized by a great deal of lively debate which focuses not so much on its subject matter as on its philosophy: its orientation to its subject matter.Much more than was so in previous decades, human geographers are being exposed to debates within philosophy as they refer to the natural and, in particular, the social sciences."
6629,在城市里，除了承载交通外，街道还有许多别的用途。城市中的人行道(sidewalks)——街道中行人走路的部分——除了承载行人走路外，也有其他很多用途。,"Streets in cities serve many purposes besides carrying vehicles,and city sidewalks --- the pedestrian parts of the streets --- serve many purposes besides carrying pedestrians."
6629,这些用途是与交通循环紧密相关的，但是并不能互相替代，就其本质来说，这些用途和交通循环系统一样，是城市正常运转机制的基本要素。,These uses are bound up with circulation but are not identical with it and in their own right they are at least as basic as circulation to the proper workings of cities.
6630,意境地图结构的深层便是意象元素之间的认知距离（cognitive distance)，它是意境地图的又一个重要方面，引发了众多学者的研究兴趣，经过研究还发现了许多重要的规律。,"Underlying the organization of people’s mental maps is the cognitive distance between image elements, and this is another aspect of imagery that has been shown to exhibit interesting and important regularities."
6630,认知距离是贮存于环境认知表述中的空间信息的基础，产生于一系列机制，包括人脑对可视物之间距离的感知、可视环境的结构和使用方式以及地图或路标等环境的符号表示物的影响。,"Cognitive distance is the basis for the spatial information stored in cognitive representations of the environment.It is generated from a variety of mechanisms that include the brain’s perception of the distance between visible objects, the use-patterns and structure of the visible environment, and the impact of symbolic representations of the environment such as maps and road signs."
6630,对大多数人而言，城市内部的认知距离通常要大于其客观距离，并且这与城市规模及使用交通方式无关，虽然也有证据表明，随着物理距离的增加总体估计会有所下降。,"For the majority of people, intra-urban cognitive distance is generally greater than objective distance, regardless of city size and their usual means of transport, although there is evidence to suggest that this overestimation declines with increasing physical distance."
6631,描述性统计包括使用单变量分析、双变量分析及多变量分析。,"Descriptiv e statistics involve the use of univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis ."
6631,这些分析方法包括使用频数分布、百分比表格以及集中趋势量数。,"These methods of analysis incorporate the use of frequency distributions, percentage tables and measures of central tendency."
6631,同时也包括使用变异量数，例如：单变量分析中的极差、百分位点及标准差；双变量分析的交叉表、散点图以及相关性的测量，如卡方检验X2、系数9、Spearman等级相关系数及皮尔森积差(r)相关系数；多变量分析的X2、方差分析和多元回归分析。,"They also incorporate the use of measures of variation, such as : ranges , percentiles and standard deviation for univariate analysis; cross-tabulation , scattergrams and measures of association suc has chi-square , the phi coefficient, Spearman' s rho and Pearson's r for bivariate analysis ; and chi-square , analysis of variance and multiple regression analysis for multivariate analysis ."
6632,扫描仪能够使调査者直接将参与者的答题纸扫描进入计算机系统进行随后的分析。,Scanners enable researchers to scan participants' response sheets directly into a computer system for subsequent analysis.
6632,答题纸的设计得能够通过扫描，且通过适当软件程序能够直接编码以进行随后的分析。,The response sheet has to be designed so that scanning is possible and to enable direct coding and subsequent analysis by appropriate software programs.
6632,扫描比编码员（人工编码员）的直接数据输入快得多。,Scanning is faster than direct data entry by coders (i.e.human coders).
6633,又假设关于这个题目有一种思想，它看起来似乎言之成理，对实际工作也很有启发，但是我们现在不能很好地把它纳人完备的微观动机和宏观行为模型中去。,"And suppose that there is a body of thinking about that subject that seems to make considerable sense, shed a fair amount of empirical light, but that doesn't seem to be something we are currently able to wrap up neatly into fully specified micromotives-and-macrobehavior models."
6633,我们应该完全忽略那种思想吗？,Should we completely ignore that body of thinking?
6633,我不这么认为，这样做对我们这个职业的很誉很不好，有人会说我们心胸狭隘。,"I don’t think so, and it speaks badly of our profession that we are so narrow-minded."
6633,我很想和经济学的另一个领域：商业周期的研究，做一个比较。,"I can't resist a parallel with another area of economics, the study of business cycles."
6634,"这种循环模型直接暗含在现代性的作品之中(Taylor,1999)。","This cyclical model is directly implicated in the creation of modernities (Taylor, 1999)."
6634,"如前所述,现代性状态经历着不断的转变和三个盟主——新商业主义、新产业主义、新消费主义——引起的经济剧变,加剧了社会转变的程度。","As previously noted, the condition of modernity is experienced as incessant change and the economic upheavals caused by the three hegemons – new mercantilism, new industrialism, new consumerism – intensified the degree of social change."
6634,"现代性造就了大量机会与风险,寻常百姓不得不对此作出反应。",
6634,"在每个霸主国内转变的压力增加造成了叫做常规现代性的日常生活新方式(Taylor,1999)。",
6635,中途拦截式调査既可使用自填式问卷也可使用调査者完成问卷。,Intercept surveys use either interviewer-completed questionnaires or self-completion questionnaires.
6635,上门调査发生在受访者的住所。,Household surveys occur at the residence of the respondent.
6635,综合性调査通过上门调査的方式实施，既可使用电话方式也可使用面对面方式进行。,Omnibus surveys are conducted through household surveys either using face-to face surveys or telephone surveys.
6636,持续时间更长的少数群体集群一般是由于外部歧视和内部凝聚力的相互作用而产生的。,Minority clusters that persist over the longer term are usually a product of the interaction between discrimination and internal cohesion.
6636,当后者在动力作用中成为主导时，所产生的居住集群被称为少数群体飞地（enclaves)；而当外部因素成为主导作用时，所产生的居住集群一般被称为特殊人群聚居区。,"Where the latter is the more dominant of the forces, the resultant residential clusters may be termed enclaves; and where external factors are more dominant, the residential clusters are generally referred to as ghettos."
6636,当然，实际上要区分究竟到何种程度隔离才算自愿或者到何种程度为非自愿是很困难的，更为现实的做法是将其作为连续统一体而非两种类型来考虑。,"In reality, of course, it is often difficult to ascertain the degree to which segregation is voluntary or involuntary, and it is more realistic to think in terms of a continuum rather than a twofold classification."
6637,关于违法犯罪行为的空间变量的大量研究都支持拥挤理论、社会无序化、社会反常状态及设计决定论等理论。但还没有系统而有效的证据显示其中某个理论居于主导地位。,"Empirical studies of spatial variations in crime and delinquency have lent support, variously, to theories of crowding, social disorganization, anomie, design determinism and deviant subcultures; but it is difficult to assemble evidence in support of any one theory in preference to the rest."
6637,既然没有能兼容并包的理论选择，那么这种折中的多因素方法必然成为一种流行的理论框架。,"In the absence of any alternative all-embracing theoretical perspective, an eclectic multifactor approach thus becomes an attractive framework of explanation."
6638,例如，地理学家可能把“时间维”加到聚落模型中，以表明在某个时期内这些模型是如何发展的。,"Thus a geographer might add a ‘time dimension’ to a model of, say, settlements to show how patterns have developed over a given period."
6638,这样的模型称为“动态模型”(与之相对的是描述某一时间事物状态的静态模型），此类模型依靠时间序列数据与分析。,Such models are called dynamic models (in contrast to ‘static models’ that describe a situation at one point in time) and rely on timeseries data and analysis.
6638,对时间的第二种看法是将之视为社会变化，其重点在于“时间的内容”。,"The second view of time is as social change, where the emphasis is upon the ‘content of time’."
6639,话语表达人类思想、幻想和欲望。,"Discourses express human thought, fantasy, and desire."
6639,它们也在制度上依据于、在物质上受制于、在经验上植根于社会和权力关系的表现形式。,"They are also institutionally based, materially constrained, experientially grounded manifestations of social and power relations."
6639,因为同样的原因，话语的效果充满并浸透了社会过程中的所有其他环节(例如，影响信仰、实践，并被它们影响)。,"By the same token, discursive effects suffuse and saturate all other moments within the social process (affecting, for example, beliefs and practices as well as being affected by them)."
6640,计算机非常有助于定量数据分析。,Computers have assisted greatly in the analysis of quantitative data.
6640,"现今，大多数的定量数据都被转变成“机读”的形式，即可以被计算机或类似的机器读取和操作的形式（Babbie 1995, P. 363)。","Nowadays, most quantitative data are turned into 'machine-readable form — a form that can be read and manipulated by computers and similar machines' (Babbie 1995, p. 363)."
6640,"可供研究者选用的定量数据分析软件包可供研究者选用有很多。例如Methodologist’s Toolchest 3.0 ，SphinxSurvey，SPSS(社会科学统计软件包) ，Minitab, SAS (统计分析系统）以及WinMAX。","There are a number of quantitative software packages available to assist researchers, such as the Methodologist's Toolchest Version 3.0, SphinxSurvey, SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences), Minitab, SAS (Statistical Analysis System), and winMAX."
6640,其中有些软件包甚至能够辅助研究设计而不再只是局限于数据分析。,Several of these software packages are aids for research design rather than solely analytical packages.
6640,下文对这些软件包进行了简要的描述，读者据此能够对使用的类型有一个全面了解，而不是仅对各个软件包的特点的概要性理解。,"A brief description of these packages follows, so that you have an understanding of the diversity available to you, rather than a comprehensive summary of all the features of each package."
6641,文学艺术以三种主要途径为地理学服务。,Literary art serves the geographer in three principal ways.
6641,文学艺术就像对人类体验与关系实验的可能模式一样，它提供这样的线索：一个地理学家在进行研究时可能寻求什么（例如，社会空间）。,"As though experiment on possible modes of human experience and relationship, it provides hints as to what a geographer might look for when he studies, for instance, social space."
6641,文学艺术作为一种人工产物，它揭示了一种文化对环境的理解与价值……,As artifact it reveals the environmental perceptions and values of a culture.…
6642,当文学理论向社会理论渗透的时候，一个剧烈冲突的舞台就形成了，一方面是广泛的实证主义、经验主义和历史唯物主义传统，另一方面是现象学、解释学和辩证法传统。,"As literary theory permeates social theory, the stage is set for strong confrontations between broadly positivist, empiricist, and historical materialist traditions on the one hand and a vast array of phenomenological, hermeneutic, and dialectical traditions on the other."
6642,因此，很可能对辩证地建构的论证进行非辩证的解读。尽管出发点是好的，但结果却是广泛的曲解。,"It is then very likely that nondialectical readings, however well intentioned, of dialectically constructed arguments will generate widespread misinterpretations."
6643,时间和空间构成宇宙的基本物理维度。,Time and space form the basic physical dimensions of the universe.
6643,这样，我们用时间量度变化，包括社会变化。,"As such, time is used to measure change, including societal change."
6643,社会时间表示含有内容的时间：变化过程中的人文现象。,Social time indicates time with content: human phenomena in the process of change.
6643,社会时间与社会空间作为“时空”而永恒地联系在一起。,Social time is invariably linked to social space as ‘time-space’.
6644,一个是“业余”科学时期，这时医生和教士起着自然历史学家的重要作用，这是18世纪和19世纪的显著特征，此后当科学进入发展中的大学时，在性质上越来越变得具有“学术性”。,"A period of ‘amateur’ science, in which doctors and clergymen played significant roles as natural historians, characterizes the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, after which science increasingly became ‘academic’ in nature as it moved into the developing universities."
6644,然后，20世纪中叶，当政府、工业界和军事界主宰着科学日程时，它变得“职业化”起来。,"Then, in the mid-twentieth century it became ‘professional’ as government, industry and the military dominated scientific agendas."
6644,科学的目的已经改变了，其社会学性质已经改变了，因此不仅难以追究个别“传统”的来源，而且这样的追究也是很不适当的。,"The purpose of science has changed, its sociology has altered, and the extraction of a single ‘tradition’ is accordingly not only difficult, but even quite inappropriate."
6645,对于后现代主义和后结构主义理解社会正义所陷入的僵局，存在着大量不满的迹象。,There are abundant signs of discontent with the impasse into which post-modernism's and poststructuralism's approach to the question of social justice has fallen.
6645,并且出现了许多不同的策略，试图恢复关于正义论证的动员力量。它们不是诉诸有限但却普遍的原则，就是更加雄心勃勃地试图在所谓现代主义的普遍主义和后结构主义的解构所产生的分裂的特殊性之间建造一座桥梁。,"And a number of different strategies have emerged to try to resurrect the mobilizing power of arguments about justice in ways which either permit appeal to carefully circumscribed, but nevertheless general, principles or which, more ambitiously, try to build a bridge between the supposed universalisms of modernism and the fragmented particularities left behind by post structuralist deconstruction."
6646,在第十二章，我们将再次遇到这个难题，在那里我采纳了身份政治学的某些前提。,"We will encounter this difficulty again in chapter 12, where I take up some of the groundings of identity politics."
6646,如果我把存在着的万物(包括每一种“他性”)都内在化了，那我必定就要代表每一人，这等于根本上什么也没说。,"If I internalize everything (including every ""otherness"") there is, then I am under the necessity to speak for everyone there is which is equivalent to saying nothing particular at all."
6646,"同样严肃的是，“内部关系学说不可能把‘变化’视为任何实际实体的属性”(Whitehead, 1969:74)。","Equally serious, is that ""the doctrine of internal relations makes it impossible to attribute 'change' to any actual entity"" (Whitehead, 1969: 74)."
6647,人依赖自然环境，且他不能把环境理解为自己能够从外边施加影响的客体，在人这个“小宇宙”和世界那个“大宇宙”之间内在相似性的观念中，我们发现这种依赖性的文化映像。那两个宇宙具有相同的结构，并由同样的要素组成。我们也可以在“宇宙的”人的身体形象上发现这一文化映像，那是不完整的身体，不能清楚区别于它所融入的周围世界，易受这个世界影响并将之吸收进自身。,"Man's dependence on the natural environment, and his incapacity to apprehend it as an object upon which he could act from outside, finds its cultural reflection in the idea of the inner analogy between man the ""microcosmos"" and world the ""megacosmos"" which have the same structure and consist of the same elements; and also in the image of the ""cosmic"" human body — incomplete, not clearly differentiated from the surrounding world into which it merges, open to this world and absorbing it into itself."
6647,（Gurevich，1985：32),(p. 32)
6648,下面举例说明把一般事务转化为可研究问题的困难：欧洲以至全球许多河谷平原森林的衰退。,"An example will illustrate this difficulty of turning a general issue into a researchable problem: the decline of floodplain woodland in many river valleys in Europe and, indeed, globally."
6648,河流的渠道化和流量管理把这些河流与泛滥平原相隔离，导致洪水频率、河道迁移速率以及泛滥平原沉积物含水层充水的速率都降低了。,"Channelization and river-flow management have separated rivers from their floodplains, leading to reductions of flood frequency, of rates of channel migration, and of recharge of floodplain sedimentary aquifers."
6648,这些变化又导致河边木本树种繁殖机会降低、生境损失和生物多样性降低。,"In turn, this has caused reduced opportunities for the regeneration of woody riparian species, a loss of habitat, and a reduction in biodiversity."
6649,对我来说，离开对土地的爱、尊敬和赞扬以及对其价值的高度重视，还能够与土地保持一种伦理关系，这是不可想象的。,"It is inconceivable to me that an ethical relation to land can exist without love, respect and admiration for the land, and a high regard for its value."
6649,提到价值，我当然是指远比经济价值更广泛的东西；我指的是哲学意义上的价值。所以，当一件东西趋向于保护生命共同体的完整性、稳定性和美的时候，它才是对的。,"By value, I of course mean something far broader than mere economic value; I mean value in the philosophical sense so that a thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community."
6649,反之，它则是错的。,It is wrong when it tends otherwise.
6650,科学研究作为一种解放力量的作用被质疑。,The role of scientific enquiry as a liberatory force is called into question.
6650,霍克海默和阿多诺并没有抛弃科学（虽然他们确实提出了一种相当有说服力的方法来理解为什么在生态运动中会有如此众多的人—尤其是自然浪漫主义家— 抛弃了科学）。,Horkheimer and Adorno did not abandon science (though they did provide a reasonably compelling way to understand why so many in the ecological movement - particularly the nature romanticists - do).
6650,他们认为批判研究的核心任务是：改革科学本身，试图重新捕获人类意义和目标，把“返魅” 于世界的努力（有时被描绘成克服“与自然疏远” ）内在化进科学本身，这种努力与作为启蒙思想中的“他者” 而嵌入到自然创造物中的“去魅” 相对。,"They took it as the key task of critical enquiry to reform science itself, to try and recapture some sense of humanity and purpose and to internalize within science itself some effort at a ""re-enchantment"" with the world (sometimes depicted as overcoming ""alienation from nature"") as opposed to the ""disenchantment"" embedded in that creation of nature as ""other"" in Enlightenment thought."
6651,城市化动力和城市构造存在于一种基本的创造性张力，它为探究不同的物种存在模式提供联系。,The dynamic of urbanization and the construct of the city exist in a fundamental creative tension that provides the nexus to explore different modes of species being.
6651,不同时空秩序和结构的生产是社会过程中的积极因素。,The production of different spatio-temporal orderings and structures are active moments within the social process.
6651,我们通过城市化（过程）和城市（物）之间辩证关系所理解的东西，建构了一种至关重大的社会生态转型观点，并且因此建构了一种根本的反资本主义和亲社会主义斗争的观点。,"What we understand by the dialectical relation between urbanization (the process) and the city (the thing) constitutes a critical point of socio-ecological transformation and, consequently, a fundamental point of anti-capitalist and pro-socialist struggle."
6652,如表9一1所示，社会生活的时间可以分为三个层次，每一个层次都与其他两个相关联（西蒙森，1991）。,"As suggested by Figure 9.1, the temporality of social life can be broken out into three levels, each of which is interrelated to the others (Simonsen, 1991)."
6652,社会生活的长时段（longue duree)属于制度（法律、家庭等）的历史发展范围。,"The longue durée of social life is bound up with the historical development of institutions (the law, the family, etc.)."
6652,在短时段（dasein)中（或预期寿命期间），社会生活受到个人和家庭生命周期的影响，也受到特定时代社会条件特征的影响（与长时段相互作用）。,"Within the dasein, or lifespan, social life is influenced by the life cycle of individuals and families and (interacting with the longue durée) by the social conditions characteristic of their particular generation."
6652,在日常生活时段上，个人的惯常性既与社会的制度框架结构也与个人的生命周期节奏相互作用。,"And within the durée of daily life, individual routines interact with both the structure of institutional frame-works and with the rhythm of their life cycle."
6653,空间和时间既不是绝对的也不外在于过程，而是偶然的并包含在过程之中。,Space and time are neither absolute nor external to processes but are contingent and contained with them.
6653,存在着多种多样的空间和时间（以及时空)，它们包含在物理、生物和社会等不同过程之中。,"There are multiple spaces and times (and space-times) implicated in different physical, biological, and social processes."
6653,这些过程全都生产——用列斐伏尔的术语——自己的时空形式。,
6653,,The latter all produce to use Lefebvre's (1991) terminology—-their own forms of space and time.
6654,当然，在所研究的空间和时间尺度之间有很密切的联系。,"There is, of course, a strong relationship between the spatial and temporal scales of study."
6654,一般意义上说，随着空间尺度的增加，时间尺度也会增加。,"In general, as spatial scale increases, so does the timescale of interest."
6654,因此，奈顿提出了研究河流地貌所用的尺度之间的近似关系，如表11.,"Thus, Knighton suggests the approximate linkage between scales in studies of fluvial landforms, as shown in Table 11."
6654,1所示。,1.
6655,历时研究是对同一或相似样本进行纵向的研究。,Longitudinal studies examine the same sample of people or a similarsample of people over time.
6655,历时研究的类型包括小样本多次调査、时间序列研究、趋势研究、世代分析以及案例研究。,"Types of longitudinal study include panelstudies, time series studies, trend studies, cohort analysis and case studies."
6655,数据可通过焦点群体法、参与观察法、访谈法和文献法获得。,"Data may be collected using focus groups, participant observation, interviews and the documentary method."
6656,过去25年来非线性、混沌、复杂和平衡稳定性问题的重要性主导着随时间变化现象的研究。,"In the last 25 years the importance of non-linearities, chaos, complexity and issues of the stability of equilibria have dominated the study of phenomena through time."
6656,传统的时间序列分析是以经验为基础的。,Conventional time-series analysis is empirically based.
6656,需要特殊的技术来识别非线性现象。,Special techniques are needed to identify the non-linearities.
6657,通过社会地创建时空的社会-文化实践，穆恩追踪了有关价值的意义的象征体系的形成。,Munn tracks the formation of symbolic systems of meanings – of values – through the socio-cultural practices which socially construct space and time.
6657,不同的时空形式源自不同的社会实践。,Different forms of space–time derive from different social practices.
6657,这意味着，加瓦人的空间和时间是多维度的和等级的，取决于被观察的各种社会实践的类型。,This means that space–time in Gawan society is multidimensional and hierarchical depending upon the sorts of social practices being looked at.
6658,在不到20年时间里，他们伐木、砍柴、放牧和耕种的土地扩大到了原来的1600倍。,"In less than two decades the area they drew on to cut wood, produce charcoal, graze animals and cultivate had grown exponentially."
6658,我将这种现象称为时空扩展。,I called this phenomenon time–space expansion.
6658,通过这样一种弹性的空间战略，年轻人能够继续生活在村子里，他们偶尔也到附近的城镇里工作。,"Through this spatial strategy of resilience, young people were able to remain in the village even if their work trajectories included occasional stints in nearby towns."
6659,第一种是时空收敛（time-space convergence）。,The first of these is time-space convergence.
6659,由于注意到本世纪内穿越距离所需时间的急剧减少，世界好像在一定程度上“变小”了。,"Through noting that the time it takes to transverse distances has fallen dramatically in recent centuries, it is sometimes suggested that the world is becoming somehow ‘smaller’."
6659,这种“缩小着的世界”的想法对地理学家并不是独特的，但作为时空收敛的精确测量则很独特。,This idea of a ‘shrinking world’ is not unique to geography but its precise measurement as time-space convergence is.
6660,实施研究设计集中体现在两个主要的活动上：资料收集和资料分析。,Implementing the research design is focused on two major activities: data collection and data analysis.
6660,两种活动都涉及研究的伦理问题，也与资料收集和分析过程中的研究者行为的伦理相关。,Both activities are associated with ethical issues relating to permission to conduct the study and to the researcher acting ethically during data collection and analysis.
6660,在这一阶段中，研究者也需要组织一次前测。,
6660,,"Also in this phase, the researcher will be involved in running a pilot of the study."
6661,自然科学中有些成就是千百年长期孕育的产物，所采用的方法及其赖以支撑的哲学框架亦已因新出现的知识而改变。,"Some of the successes of the physical sciences have been the product of lengthy gestation over hundreds of years, and the methods employed and the philosophical frameworks underpinning them have changed in response to emerging understandings."
6661,因此， 除了多元论之外并不存在什么单一的传统。,"Thus there is no single tradition, except that of pluralism."
6661,在这种“传统”之中，地理学从观察、测量、各种实验、理论改进和试验中汲取了丰富的方法。,"Within this ‘tradition’, there is a rich source for geography of methods drawing on observation, measurement, various forms of experimentation, theory development, and testing."
6662,“测试法”这个方法不全是数学方法。,The testing method — this method is not a fully mathematical method.
6662,它是一种实验法，试图确定某一个市场分区，使之先于其他市场区域作出变革。,It is an experimental method that attempts to determine a market section that changes ahead of other market sections.
6662,这个方法用于中期到长期的预测。,The method is used for medium to long-term forecasts.
6663,"乔利（Chorley, 1978）对比了地貌研究中实用主义和现实主义方法的差别。",Chorley (1978) has drawn the distinction between functional and realist approaches in geomorphology.
6663,实用主义理论就是进行统计归纳，而关注过程动力学就意味着要作更为现实的理解。,Functional theories involve statistical generalizations whereas a focus on process dynamics implies greater realism of understanding.
6663,这样就出现两个问题：小尺度的研究结果——不论是实用主义的还是现实主义的——能不能应用到更大的尺度上？,"Two questions arise: can the results of small-scale studies, whether functional or realist, be applied to the larger scale?"
6663,地方研究在何种程度上能够代表更大的区域范围，还是只能作为一个独特案例研究？,And to what extent are local studies representative of the wider region or merely unique case studies?
6664,很难设想身体以外的地方。,It is difficult to think of places outside the body.
6664,例如，设想一次乡间散步，地方不仅是由两眼所见的景色所组成的，而且还有在山谷中登高趋低，树林中的风吹鸟鸣，触摸围墙和树枝，以及被践踏的野草和肥料的气味。,"Think, for example, of a country walk and place consists not just of eye surveying prospect but also the push and pull of walking up hill and down dale, the sound of birds and the wind in the trees, the touch of wall and branch, the smell of trampled grass and manure."
6664,或者设想一次城市中的散步，地方也不仅是由两眼所见的其他人或广告牌或楼宇所组成，而且还有交通与谈话的噪声，同售票机与扶手的接触，以及废气与烹调食物的气味。,"Or think of a walk in the city and place consists not just of eye making contact with other people or advertising signs or buildings, but also the sound of traffic noise and conversation, the touch of ticket machine and hand rail, the smell of exhaust fumes and cooking food."
6665,历时研究是指对同一或相似样本在一定时间段内进行研究。,Longitudinal studies involve the study of the same people or a similarsample of people over a set period of time.
6665,这种研究的数据可能通过访谈、焦点群体法、参与观察法和文献法(在本章后面进行解释)得到。,"Data may be collected usinginterviews, focus groups, participant observation and the documentarymethod (explained later in the chapter)."
6665,历时研究也可用于定量方法，但因为本章关注的是定性研究方法，因此只讨论有关整体归纳范式的方法。,"Longitudinal studies may also beconducted using quantitative methods; however, as this chapter focuses on qualitative methods, only those methods associated with a holistic-inductive paradigm are discussed."
6665,纽曼（2000)曾划分出历时研究的不同类型.小样本多次调查、时间序列研究、趋势研究以及世代分析。,"Neuman (2000) identifies several types of longitudinal studies: panel studies, time series studies, trend studies and cohort analysis."
6665,他认为案例研究也是历时研究的一种数据收集方法。,He also includes case studies as a method of data collection for longitudinal studies.
6666,20世纪之初掀起了一场关于“大国”前途的充满焦虑的辩论。,The onset of the twentieth century provoked a rather anxious debate about the future of the ‘great powers’.
6666,许多人认为1900年标志着世界历史的转折点，是欧洲持续扩张400年的终结。,"Many believed that 1900 would mark a turning point in world history, the end of a 400-year period of continuous European expansion."
6666,世界地图上未探查过和未被认领的“空白”空间在迅速减少，或者看来是如此，“世界封闭”（global closure）之意呼之欲出。,"The unexplored and unclaimed ‘blank’ spaces on the world map were rapidly diminishing, or so it seemed, and the sense of a ‘global closure’ was palpable."
6667,发展经济学和经济地理学致命的问题是该领域的先驱没有明确地说明市场结构，即在他们所描述的假想经济中的竞争状况。,"In both development and geography the crucial problem, in particular, was the inability of the field's pioneers to be explicit about market structurethat is, about the conditions of competition in the hypothetical economies they were describing."
6667,这是一个很微妙的问题；事实上，对于不从事严肃的经济学建模工作的人，不可能向他们解释清楚这为什么竟然成为一个难题。,"It's a subtle problem; indeed, it is virtually impossible to explain why it is an issue at all to anyone who has not tried to engage in serious economic modeling."
6667,但是对于把发展经济学和经济地理学纳入主流经济学理论的诸多努力而言，市场结构的难题却被证明是致命的。,And yet the market structure issue proved fatal to efforts to integrate both development and geography into the mainstream of economic theory.
6668,本章中提出的市民身份、家长式统治、种族歧视、集体消费、法律、政府和市民社会等问题，都以某种方式来自于城市中的社会公正问题。,"The issues of citizenship, patriarchy, racism, collective consumption, the law, the state and civil society reviewed in this chapter all raise, in one way or another, the question of social justice in the city."
6668,哈维在恩格尔之后认识到公正的概念不仅随时间和地方而变化，而且还因人而异。,"David Harvey, following Engels, recognizes that conceptions of justice vary not only with time and place, but also with the persons concerned."
6668,因此，最根本的是考察创造生活世界的物质及道德基础，各种不同的社会公正概念正是由此而生。,It follows that it isessential to examine the material and moral bases for the production of the lifeworlds from which divergent concepts of social justice emerge.
6668,我们会在随后的几章中进行考察。,This we shall do in subsequent chapters.
6669,但是，如果在建公园的过程中不考虑将人聚集起来的原因，而是把公园作为人的替代品，那么把公园建立在有人的地方就毫无意义。,"But there is no point in bringing parks to where the people are, if in the process the reasons that the people are there are wiped out and the park substituted for them."
6669,这是在住宅项目、市政和文化中心的设计中存在的根本错误之一。,This is one of the basic errors in housing-project and civic-and cultural-center design.
6669,从任何形式上说，街区公园都不能代替城市的多样性。,Neighborhood parks fail to substitute in any way for plentiful city diversity.
6669,那些成功的街区公园从来就没有干扰过周围复杂和多样化的城市功能或对其构成障碍。,Those that are successful never serve as harriers or as interruptions to the intricate functioning of the city around them.
6669,相反，那些公园将周边地区多样化的功能贯穿在一起，起了一种很和谐的组织作用。,"Rather, they help to knit together diverse surrounding functions by giving them a pleasant joint facility."
6670,大约与此同时，出现了另一个重要地标。,Another important landmark appeared about the same time.
6670,"这就是“攀级范例” (panrarchy paradigm)，它是因霍林(Holling, 1973)创造性的工作建立起来的，他发展了对稳定性和弹性的隐喻，承认多稳态(multiple stable states)的存在，并将其应用到对人为系统和自然系统转化的理解中。","This is the panarchy paradigm that builds on the original work of Holling (1973) in developing the metaphor of stability and resilience, admitting the existence of multiple stable states and applying it to understanding transformations in human and natural systems."
6670,霍林和冈德森(Holling and Gunderson，2002)发展了受干扰后适应性循环的概念。,"In particular, Holling and Gunderson (2002) developed the concept of adaptive cycles following disturbance."
6671,教育的需承量在一定时期内发生变化基于两个原因。,The quantity of education demanded raises over time for two reasons.
6671,首先是收入效应（income effect)。,The first is the income effect.
6671,制造业生产率的提高带来了实际经济收入的提高：经济总产量提高了，居民购买力也得以提高。,"The increase in manufacturing productivity increases the real income of the economy: the total output of the economy increases, increasing the purchasing power of its citizens."
6672,盗窃的社会总成本等于受害成本与防止成本之和。,The total social cost of burglaries equals the sum of the cost incurred by victims and the cost of prevention.
6672,若每个犯罪成本不变，那么受苒成本增加率也是不变的。,Victim cost increases at a constant rate if the cost per crime is constant.
6672,由于边际收益的滅少，防止成本随着盗窃次数的减少而快速增加，盗窃总成本在B上最小（点G）。,"The prevention cost increases rapidly as the number of burglaries decreases, a result of diminishing marginal returns.Total cost is minimized with B burglaries (point G)."
6673,城市开发公司是一系列准自治非政府组织 (quangos)之一（其他还有英格兰和威尔士的培训与企业理事会TECs以及苏格兰的地方企业理事会），它们近年来在英国承担了很多治理职能。,"The UDCs are one of a series of quangos that have taken over many aspects of governance in the UK in recent years (Peck andJones, 1995)."
6673,广义的类似政策在美国也实施过。,Broadly similar policies have been enacted in the United States.
6673,例如，授权区（empowerment zones)的目的也在于吸引私人部门资金投人到缺乏投资的地区，但是在这个案例中，存在着保证任何新的动议都得到 地方社区支持的明显考虑。,"For example, empowerment zones are also intended to attract private sector funds into deprived areas but in this case there is a much explicit concern to secure local community support for any new initiatives."
6673,到目前为止，授权区一直都集中在底特律这样的东北部工业衰落城市中，80个地方项目都是致力于增加培训和改善社会住房。,"So far empowerment zones have been concentrated in the deindustrializing cities of the Northeast such as Detroit, where 80 local projects are aimed at improving training and social housing (Hall, 1998)."
6674,采用实证主义范式的研究者通常主要使用定量研究方法。,A researcher operating from a positivist paradigm will primarily use quantitative methods.
6674,具体的数据收集的方法包括问卷法、观察法、文档分析法以及实验和准实验的方法（这些方法将在第三章和第八章中做出解释）。,"The methods of data collection include questionnaires, observation, documentary analysis and experiments and quasi-experiments.(These methods are explained in chapters 3 and 8.)"
6674,数据分析通常采用统计方法，由此得出由数字表示的研究结论。,Analysis will be conducted using statistical calculations and the units of study will subsequently become numeric representations.
6675,数据编码包括三个步骤：编码的形成（此过程可以发生在数据收集过程之前，也可以包括在数据收集的工具中）；数据输入；数据整理。,Coding data involves three steps: the development of codes (which mayoccur prior to the data collection process and which may appear on datacollection tools); data entry; and data cleaning.
6675,读者一定记得定性数据分析也涉及数据编码，并且第七章也描述了大量的给定性数据编码的方法（例如：描述性、解释性及模型编码、开放式编码、轴心式编码及选择式编码）。,"You will recall that qualitative data analysis also involves data coding and chapter 7 described a number of ways to code qualitative data (descriptive, interpretive andpattern-based codes, and open, axial and selective coding, for example)."
6675,如果需要回顾以上内容，请参考第七章。,Refer back to chapter 7 if you need to refresh your memory.
6676,数据的整理包括两种方式：可能编码式整理和逻辑整理 (Babbie 1995)。,Data cleaning involves two types of cleaning — possible-code cleaning and contingency cleaning (Babbie 1995).
6676,"数据的整理是很有必要的，因为数据输入包含人员介入，不管人们在输入资料时如何地小心翼翼,但错误依然难以避免。",Cleaning data is necessary because of the fact that data entry involves humans and humans are prone to make errors despite their best intentions not to do so.
6676,数据输入中的错误一般是指编码员编排了错误的编码或调査对象犯了错误，如写了两个答案的编码而不是一个。,Errors in data entry are associated with coders assigning the wrong codes and respondents making mistakes such as coding two responses instead of only one.
6677,就像上文提到的，数据输入有多种方法可资使用。,"As already noted above, there are a number of ways that data can beentered."
6677,数据输入的轻松与否将取决于在调査设计阶段，调查者是否对数据分析过程给予了全面的考虑。,The ease of data entry will depend on the researcher giving fullconsideration to the data analysis phase in the research design stage.
6677,举个例子，如果调查问卷的设计包含了数据编码，那么就有可能立刻输入数据；否则，就需要准备编码簿，并且数据输入还要求数据输入人员在调查问卷和计算机程序之间互相参照（这也增加了在数据输人过程中犯错误的概率）。,"It ispossible, for example, to enter data immediately from the questionnaire ifdata codes are included in the questionnaire design.Otherwise, code books need to be prepared and data entry will require some cross-referencing between the questionnaire and the computer program by the data entry person (which also increases the chances of possible errors in data entry)."
6678,许多地貌图的绘制是为了咨询报告和应用项目。,Many geomorphological maps are produced for consultancy reports and in applied projects.
6678,这些图常常是专门为某个地点或某种问题而绘制的，而且经常不在国有土地上。,These are often site- and problem-specific and may often not be in the public domain.
6678,"现在广泛应用GIS绘制的数字化地形模型，成为地貌学家的重要工具(DeMers, 2005)。","Digital terrain modelling using GIS is now widely applied and is an important tool for geomorphologists (DeMers, 2005)."
6678,"在这方面再次证明GPS的价值是无法衡量的（Longley et al., 2001)。","Again GPS has proved invaluable in this respect (Longley et al., 2005)."
6679,单一税的另一变通就是双比率税（two-rate tax)或分割税（split tax)。,"Another alternative to a pure land tax is the two-rate tax, or the split tax."
6679,根据传统的财产税，土地和改良土地而增加的价值按同样的比率征税。,"Under the conventional property tax, land and improvements are taxed at the same rate."
6679,3%的财产税实际上就是对土地征收3%的税并对改良土地而增加的价值征收3%的税。,A 3 percent property tax is actually a 3 percent tax on land and a 3 percent tax on improvements.
6680,本章进一步详尽地描述了建立在这些要点之上的分析方法，以及所有那些由沃斯（de Vaus） （1995）在开篇引文中描述的方法。,This chapter describes in further detail the methods of analysis that arefounded in these points as well as those described by de Vaus (1995) in the opening quote.
6680,本章将为读者介绍单变量分析、双变量分析和多变量分析，还将使读者熟悉各种分析方法的适用条件，这些条件源自于所调査的各种变量的测量层次(定类、定序、定距及定比）。,"You will be introduced to univariate analysis, bivariate analysis and multivariate analysis.You will also be familiarised with the conditions regarding the use of the various methods of analysis.These conditions are derived from  the level of measurement of the variable (s) being investigated (nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio)."
6680,此外，读者也将了解到沃斯并未提及但却被列入本章学习目标中的其他分析方法。,You will also be introduced to additional methods of analysis not described by de Vaus but listed in the objectives for this chapter.
6681,正如法伊夫指出的，这些定性方法通常（可能有些错误地）被认为较之定量方法要容易一些。,These qualitative methods are often ---somewhat mistakenly --- thought of as less useful than quantitative methods.
6681,但实际上，如果使用精确，研究者能通过定性方法对支撑定量方法的假设条件进行更严谨的定义。,"However, if used rigorously, qualitative methods can enable the researcher to take a serious look at the assumptions underpinning the methods being used in the analysis."
6681,"特别是，由定性方法引起的关于被观察人和观察人共同价值观的数据选择的内在价值问题（即被安东尼•吉登斯称为“双重解释""(double hermeneutic)的问题），","In particular, qualitative methods raise questions about the values inherent in the choice of data being collected together with the values of those being observed and those undertaking the observation --- what has been termed by Anthony Giddens the double hermeneutic."
6682,第一种做法是对理论解释能力的判断。,The first is a judgement about the explanatory power of a theory.
6682,这就提出了解释与预测之间的不对称性问题；正如任何统计学预测模型在经济学或水文学中所展示的那样，解释的能力并不意味着预测的能力。,"This introduces the asymmetry between explanation and prediction; the capacity to predict does not imply an ability to explain, as any statistical forecasting model in economics or hydrology demonstrates."
6682,所以，对旨在提供解释的理论的预测检验生来就是自相矛盾的，而且还需要某些东西。,"A predictive test of a theory that purports to provide explanation is inherently inconsistent, therefore, and something is required in addition."
6683,第二，正如利科(Ricoeur，1991)所言，自我感和身份感部分地通过我们用以描述自己与世界暂时关系的叙事手段来建立，并因此呈现相对持久的结构。,"Secondly, as Ricoeur (1991) notes, our own sense of self-hood and of identity in part gets constructed through the narrative devices which we use to describe our temporal relation to the world, and so assumes relatively durable configurations."
6683,虽然身份并不依靠同一性或本质，但根据我们讲述自身历史和地理——简言之，我们在物之秩序中的位置——的故事，它确实获得了持久性和永恒性。,"While identity does not rest upon sameness or essence, it does acquire durability and permanence according to the stories we tell ourselves and others about our history and our geography, about, in short, our place in the order of things."
6683,虽然身份使他性内在化了，但它仍然为起作用的“他性”的(常常是空间的)领域以及他者与特殊自我感之间的关系划定界限，并使这两者相对持久。,"Although identity internalizes othernesses, it nevertheless delimits and renders relatively durable both the (often spatial) field of ""othernesses"" brought into play and the relation of those others to a particular sense of self-hood."
6684,当所要调查研究的旅游现象的资料不存在或只有很少时通常采用探索性研究方法。,Exploratory research is conducted when very little or no data exist on the tourism phenomenon being investigated.
6684,从探索性研究中得出的结果可用于拓展出一个更为深入的研究项目。,Findings from exploratory research can be used to develop a more extensive research project.
6684,一般来讲，探索性研究是不公开的，其主要作用是帮助建立适合于将来研究使用的类目和概念；用于确定某个主要研究的可行性或了解研究论题相关领域中存在的有关问题。,"Generally, exploratory research is not published.Rather, it serves to establish possible categories and concepts suitable for use in further research, in determining the feasibility of a major study or in understanding that which exists in areas related to the study topic."
6685,在这个意义上，少数群体包括美国城市中的非裔美国人、波多黎各人、意大利人、犹太人、墨西哥人、越南人和（亚洲）印度人；英国城市中的加勒比黑人、亚洲人和爱尔兰人；法国城市中的阿尔及利亚人和西班牙人；德国城市中的土耳其人和克罗地亚人等等。,"Minority groups in this sense therefore include African-Americans, Puerto Ricans, Italians, Jews, Mexicans, Vietnamese and (Asian) Indians in American cities; Afro-Caribbeans, Asians and Irish in British cities; Algerians and Spaniards in French cities; Turks and Croats in German cities; and so on."
6685,当然，东道主社会不一定是均质的，它通常包含一个占主导地位的特权群体（charter group)，也正代表了新的少数群体所进人的母体。,"While the host society may not be homogeneous, it always contains a charter group that represents the dominant matrix into which new minority groups are inserted."
6685,在北美、澳大利亚和英国的大部分城市中，特权群体是带有“盎格鲁-撒克逊”文化的白人。,"In North America, Australia and Britain the charter group in most cities is white, with an ‘Anglo-Saxonn culture."
6685,根据各个城市所包含的人群，其少数群体与特权群体的空间隔离程度在不同城市之间也有很大差异。,The degree to which minority groups are spatially segregated from the charter group varies a good deal from city to city according to the group involved.
6686,第二类的用地形式可以是特殊用地（special land），通常不是当做步行用的大街。,"The second type of land, which can be ca1led special land, is not commonly used as public thoroughfare by people on foot."
6686,在这上面可以建房也可以不建，可以是公共场所也可以不是，可以让人们进入到里面也可以不让进人。,It can be built on or not; It can be publicly owned or not; it can be physically accessible to people or not.
6686,但这不是问题的所在。,This is beside the point.
6686,关键的问题是人们要绕过它走，或沿着它的边走，但不是在其中穿行。,"The point is that people walk around it, or alongside it, but not through it."
6687,研究者可以用条形图或者饼状图来描述表格中的数据。,The researcher could present the data from this table as a bar graph or a pie chart.
6687,条形图使用垂直的长方条来描述每个种类以及他们的频数，这些长方条是分离的，表示每个测量变量之间都没有数量关系（Saramakos 1998)。,Bar graphs portray each of the categories and their frequency using vertical bars that are separated to show there is no quantitative relationship between each of the measures (Sarantakos 1998).
6687,饼状图能够用所测量单位的百分比大小来描述数据(Sarantakos 1998)。,Pie charts enable representation of data to be proportionate to the size of the unit being measured (Sarantakos 1998).
6688,铁轨（railroad tracks）就是一个典型交界地带的例子。很久以前，轨道也代表了一种社会交界地带的意思。“轨道的另一边”，此话的含义一般是指与大城市接壤的小城镇地区。,"Railroad tracks are the classic examples of borders, so much so that they came to stand, long ago,for social borders too --- ""the other side of the tracks"" --- a connotation, incidentaly, associated with small towns  rather than with big cities."
6688,我们现在要谈的不是这种含义的交界处，而是指它对周边区域带来的实际的和功能上的影响。,"Here we shall be concerned not with the social connotations of areas demarcated by borders, but rather with the physical and functional effects of their borders on their immediate city surroundings."
6689,需要研究的第二个问题是将一个尺度的分析结果应用到不同尺度上去。,The second question relates to the need to apply the results of one scale of analysis at different scales.
6689,这涉及把结果从小尺度到大尺度的尺度放大——例如把小流域的研究结果推广到大河流域。,"This may involve upscaling of results from smaller to larger areas – for example, extending results from small catchment studies to large river basins."
6689,也可能在有些情况下是尺度缩小——例如，将通用循环模型（全球尺度）的结果应用到某个区域。,"It may also in some circumstances involve downscaling – for example, applying the results of general circulation models (global scale) to particular regions."
6690,隔离和集聚在空间的表现是由歧视、组织作用和群体内部凝聚力的相互作用而决定的。,"The spatial expression of segregation and congregation, then, is determined by the interplay of discrimination, fabric effects and the strength of internal group cohesion."
6690,如果一个地方少数群体和特权群体之间的感知社会距离较近，那么特权群体的歧视和少数群体内部凝聚力的作用就会减弱，而少数群体的居住集群很可能只是被广泛的城市社会空间组织同化的一个暂时阶段。,"Where the perceived social distance between the minority group and the charter group is relatively small, the effects of both charter group discrimination and internal cohesion are likely to be minimized and so minority residential clusters are likely to be only a temporary stage in the assimilation of the group into the wider urban sociospatial fabric."
6690,这种集群有可能被称为侨民区。,Such clusters may be termed colonies.
6690,它们像河口港一样，有效地为自己群体的成员提供了一个基地，使他们在这里受到文化的同化，并从这里再分散到其他空间。,"They essentially serve as a port-of-entry for members of the group concerned, providing a base from which group members are culturally assimilated and spatially dispersed."
6690,因此，随着时间的推移，它们的存留取决于其少数群体新成员的不断输人。,Their persistence over time is therefore dependent on the continuing input of new minority group members.
6691,家庭环境和同龄人效应。,Home Environment and Peer Group Effects.
6691,研究者也赞同同龄人对成绩的影响，如果一个学生的周围都是聪明好学的学生，那么他就会学到更多。,Researchers also agree about the effects of the peer group on achievement: a student learns more if she is surrounded by smart and motivated students.
6691,一些证据表明成绩差的同学受同龄人的影响最大，班级里聪明好学的学生增加，成绩最差的学生受益最大。,There is some evidence that the largest peer group effects are experienced by low achievers: the students at the bottom of the class have the most to gain from adding smart and motivated students to the class.
6692,有时，研究者们选择同时采访夫妻二人。,"Sometimes, researchers choose to interview heterosexual couples together."
6692,人们对这种数据收集方法的恰当性持有不同的意见。,There are varying attitudes to the appropriateness of this for data collection.
6692,瑞纳兹(1992，p.41)的报道称，“社会学家黎丽安•鲁宾曾写道，参与到妇女运动之后她才意识到，采访夫妻最好分别进行，因为‘当男人不在场时，女人更容易自由地谈论她们对于生活、角色以及婚姻（关系）的感觉’”。,"Reinharz (1992, p. 41) reports that the 'sociologist Lillian Rubin wrote that involvement in the women's movement showed her the need to interview husbands and wives separately and privately because ""women tend to discuss their feelings about their lives, their roles, and their marriages [relationships] more freely when men are not present'""."
6693,计算机非常有助于定量数据分析。,Computers have assisted greatly in the analysis of quantitative data.
6693,"现今，大多数的定量数据都被转变成“机读”的形式，即可以被计算机或类似的机器读取和操作的形式（Babbie 1995, P. 363)。","Nowadays, most quantitative data are turned into 'machine-readable form — a form that can be read and manipulated by computers and similar machines' (Babbie 1995, p. 363)."
6693,"可供研究者选用的定量数据分析软件包有很多。例如Methodologist’s Toolchest 3.0 ，SphinxSurvey，SPSS(社会科学统计软件包) ，Minitab, SAS (统计分析系统）以及WinMAX。","There are a number of quantitative software packages available to assist researchers, such as the Methodologist's Toolchest Version 3.0, SphinxSurvey, SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences), Minitab, SAS (Statistical Analysis System), and winMAX."
6693,其中有些软件包甚至能够辅助研究设计而不再只是局限于数据分析。,Several of these software packages are aids for research design rather than solely analytical packages.
6693,下文对这些软件包进行了简要的描述，读者据此能够对使用的类型有一个全面了解，而不是仅对各个软件包的特点的概要性理解。,"A brief description of these packages follows, so that you have an understanding of the diversity available to you, rather than a comprehensive summary of all the features of each package."
6694,地理学理论的总体是什么？,What are the populations for geographical theories?
6694,在很多情况里总体的所指远不清楚。,They are far from clear in many cases.
6694,那么样本又指什么？,Thus what do the samples refer to?
6694,（在设想应用中心地理论的场合，一个地方的样本是对包括有200个聚落的农村威尔特郡的研究呢？还是对200个聚落中样本的研究？在第二种情形下，它肯定不适宜构成一个随机样本。,"(Is a study of rural Wiltshire, comprising 200 settlements, a sample of one area in which central place theory is supposed to apply? Or is it a sample of 200 settlements, in which case it is surely not a properly constituted random sample?)"
6694,）如果无论总体还是样本的性质都不清楚，那么统计意义上之检验的合理性必然会有问题。,"If the nature of neither population nor sample is clear, then the validity of statistical significance tests must be very much in doubt."
6695,时间和空间现在被解释为“只是对包容性统一之总体性的抽象，是彼此在对方之中成形的……时空只不过是把集合体组成统一体的体系”。,"Space and time are now construed as ""simply abstractions from the totality of prehensive unifications as mutually patterned in each other ... space-time is nothing else than a system of pulling together of assemblages into unities."""
6695,因而， “事件”这个词便指“这些时空统一体中的一个”。,"The word ""event"" is then defined to mean ""one of these spatiotemporal unities."""
6695,当然，此处有趣的是把各种成分集合成统一体从而使得时空性得到定义的实际过程。,"What is interesting here, of course, is the actual process of putting together assemblages into unities so as to define spatio-temporalities."
6696,只有当河流动力足以携带该粒级时含沙量才会增加。,Only when the stream power is sufficient to entrain that grain size can the sediment load increase.
6696,随着平均粒径对分选(X2)的比率增大，携带的阈限(搬运某一粒径开始的数值)也增大。,The threshold of entrainment (the value at which transport of a given particle size begins) increases as the ratio of mean grain size/sorting (x2) increases.
6696,超过这个阈限以后河流动力微小的增大就会使泥沙搬运量产生一个跳跃。,This produces a jump in the amount of sediment transported after the tiny increase in stream power that crosses the threshold.
6696,这个跳跃成为突变(catastrophe)(法语中意为台阶)，不要与意为灾难的灾变(catastrophic)相混淆。,"This jump is called a catastrophe (French for step), not to be confused with catastrophic, meaning disaster."
6696,非线性突变的发现导致被称为突变论的非线性科学整个领域及其专门的数学主体(specialized body of mathematics)的出现。,The discovery of non-linear catastrophes has led to a whole area of non-linear science called catastrophe theory with its own specialized body of mathematics.
6697,这种变化能够联系到另一种情形，其中我们对图像空间的想法正在改变。,This change can be linked to another way in which our thinking about image space is changing.
6697,在过去，某种图像常常创造出与其相似的空间。,"In the past, particular kinds of image very often created spaces in their likeness."
6697,例如，某种空间对称性观念帮助产生了帕拉第奥式（Palladian）的景观，而某种现代主义的敏感性则帮助产生那种布局严谨而而秩序井然的景观，至今在许多城市居住区中仍能找到。,"So, for example, a particular notion of spatial symmetry helped to produce the Palladian landscape while a particular kind of modernist sensibility helped to produce the kinds of strictly laid out and ascetically ordered landscapes still to be found lingering on in many urban housing estates."
6698,贫穷是显而易见的，而富裕也极尽招摇。,"Poverty is manifest, affluence is ostentatious."
6698,绅士化区位就位于贬值的老房地产旁边。,Gentrification sits beside the devalorization of old property.
6698,到警察局的布告栏去寻找信息，发现又发生了一次种族袭击，而布告栏上的涂鸦则显示了对地方警察局调查能力的信任状况。,"The appeals for information in the police posters tell of yet another racist attack, just as the graffiti with which they are decorated demonstrate the credence given locally to the powers of police investigation."
6699,"因此,约翰•弗雷泽•哈特(John Fraser Hart,1982)等地理学家吸收了康德的唯心主义哲学观点,认为尺度不过是为了将世界条理化而信手拈来的概念化机制,而其他地理学家则根据马克思主义的唯物主义理论认为尺度是真实存在的社会产物(也就是说尺度在这个世界上确实存在),而且同样有其构建的政治方式。特别是史密斯认为尺度的产生源自资本内部的矛盾[5]。通过案例分析,他研究了1980年代美国经济的重组如何导致其工业景观尺度的重新确定(Smith and Dermis,1987; Smith,1988)。","Hence, while geographers such as John Fraser Hart (1982: 21) drew upon Immanuel Kant’s idealist philosophy to suggest that scales were no more than handy conceptual mechanisms for ordering the world (‘subjective artistic devices ... shaped to fit the hand of the individual user’), others drew upon Marxist ideas of materialism to argue that scales were real social products (that is to say, that scales really exist in the world) and that, as such, there was a politics to their construction – Neil Smith, for instance, contended that the production of scales emerged out of contradictions within capital, showing, by way of example, how restructuring in the US economy during the 1980s was leading to a rescaling and reregionalization of its industrial landscape (Smith and Dennis, 1987; Smith, 1988)."
6700,最近，关于嵌在特殊话语之中的“主体位置”或“立场”亦有很多有益的讨论。,"There has also been much salutary discussion recently on the ""subject positionality"" or the ""standpoint"" embedded in particular discourses."
6700,人们开始注意隐蔽的位置性和权力游戏，它们隐藏于甚至在表面上最无害和在道德上中立的话语中。,Attention has been drawn to the hidden positionalities and power plays that lie buried within even the most seemingly innocuous and ethically neutral discourses.
6700,在今天，提出任何“真理”或者甚至“相关性”和“政治学”主张而不提供这些主张的原始根据(包括“主体位置”声明)，是很困难的。,"It is difficult now to advance any claims to ""truth"" or even ""relevance"" or ""politics"" without providing some initial grounds (including declarations of ""subject positionality"") upon which to base such claims."
6701,全球化也与更大范围的全球文化的发展相联系。,Globalization is also associated with the development of a broader global culture.
6701,这是一个颇受争议的观点，但基本上包含了西方唯物论价值观的广泛传播。,This is a controversial idea but essentially involves the widespread diffusion of Western values of materialism.
6701,全球化也可从好莱坞电影在全世界的普及和“世界音乐”的日益流行中看到。,Globalization can also be seen in the popularity of Hollywood films throughout the world and the increased popularity of ‘world music’.
6701,因此，一般认为，全球化包括了文化的均化，即全球范围内文化内部联系的发展。,It is therefore argued that globalization involves the homogenization of the culture --- the development of cultural interrelatedness throughout the globe.
6702,物质实体和文化之间的关系可以用目的性（intenticmality)这个概念来加以概括。,The relationship between material objects and culture may be encapsulated by the notion of intentionality.
6702,这个概念使大家注意到这样一个事实，即物质实体本身是没有意义的，它们只有通过人们的使用才被赋予了意义。,This concept draws attention to the fact that objects have no meaning in themselves but only acquire meaning through the uses that people put them to.
6702,总之，文化包含的内容远远超过了高雅艺术。事实上，在文化研究中，文本包含了任何一种有意义的表述（representation)形式，可以是广告、大众电视节目、电影、流行音乐甚至食品。,"To sum up, culture involves much more than high art; indeed, in cultural studies a text comprises any form of representation with meaning and can include advertising, popular television programmes, films, popular music and even food."
6703,城市美化运动的目的是建立城市标志性建筑。,The aim of the City Beautiful was the City Monumental.
6703,一些建造系统林阴大道的宏大计划被制定出来，但大部分却没有任何结果。,"Great schemes were drawn up for systems of baroque boulevards,which mainly came to nothing."
6703,这个运动真正产生的结果是仿照芝加哥展览会的中心标志物，一个又一个城市建造了市中心，或文化中心(cultural center )。,"What did come out of the movement was the Center Monumental, modeled on the fair.City after city built its civic center or its cultural center."
6703,这些建筑物沿着一条林阴大道，就像费城的本杰明•富兰克林公园大道;或靠着 一个商场，就像克利夫兰的市政中心;或比邻公园，就像圣路易的市中心;或与公园交错在一起，就像旧金山的市政中心。,"These buildings were arranged along a boulevard as at Benjamin Franklin Parkway in Philadelphia, or along a mail like the Government Center in Cleveland, or were bordered by park, like the Civic Cemer at St. Louis, or were interspersed with park, like the Civic Center at San Francisco."
6704,因此很明显，词汇不是中立的，而是具有很强的根本假设和含义的。,"Clearly, then, words are not neutral but have powerful underlying assumptions and meanings."
6704,这表明要理解支撑语言的话语，很重要的一点就是文化（culture)的分析。,This means that analysis of culture is crucial to understanding the language and discourse.
6704,后结构主义思想对城市社会地理学的影 响十分显著，这反映在分支学科明显的“文化转向”（‘culture turn’）之上。,"The effect of poststructuralist thinking on urban social geography has been substantial, to the point where the subdiscipline has taken a clear ‘cultural turn’."
6704,应当强调的是，这不是文化地理学中传统文化观念的转变（有时也被称为“超有机体”观点；参见邓肯，1980），而是向文化作为一个具有共同意义的系统的人类学观点的转变。,"This, it should be emphasized, is not a turn toward the traditional notion of culture within cultural geography (sometimes termed the ‘superorganic’ view; see Duncan, 1980), but to the anthropological idea of cultures as systems of shared meanings."
6705,问题的确认乃是科学工作中十分重要的部分，而且常常是十分困难的劳心之举。,"Problem recognition is a very important part of scientific endeavour, and often a very difficult intellectual exercise."
6705,任何一个想提出一项研究计划的人都要明白引文中最后一句话的重要性。,Anyone who has tried to develop a research project will know the significance of the final phrase in this quotation.
6705,找到一个有兴趣乃至有价值的一般研究领域并不难，但是很难把这种兴趣转变为一套可以进行研究的问题。,"It is often easy to find a general area in which research would be interesting, even valuable, but less straightforward to turn that interest into a researchable set of questions."
6705,这就是问题表述的精髓，也是使科学成为如此成功的事业之所在。,"This is the essence of problem formulation, and a scientific tradition which has made science such a successful enterprise."
6706,人所皆知，马克思憎恶乌托邦思想。因此，把他拖进这样一种争论似乎是奇怪的。,"In view of Marx's well-known antipathy to Utopian thinking, it may seem strange to indude him in a discussion of this sort."
6706,不过，他确实提出了某种乌托邦理想，并十分急切地使之与其他乌托邦理想区别开来。,But Marx produced a certain kind of Utopianism that he was most anxious to keep separate from other varieties.
6707,反机构化最极端的结果发生在加利福尼亚州。,The most extreme consequences of deinstitutionalization are to be found in California.
6707,该州精神病院的迅速关闭导致服务依赖型集聚区的出现（也被称为无墙庇护所 (asylum-without-walls) 沃尔科， 1981）。,"The rapid closure of psychiatric hospitals in the state led to the creation of service-dependent ghettoes (also termed the ‘asylum-without-walls’, Wolch, 1981)."
6707,从前的隐性精神病人被限制在环境恶劣的邻里中，而规划立法则将基于社区的设施规划在更加富裕的地区。,Former in-patients have become restricted to poorer-quality neighbourhoods as zoning legislation has kept community-based facilities outside more affluent areas.
6707,为了获得利益，基于社区的服务业已经得到了发展，但是其中一些服务业相对规模较大，拥有一百多名从业者，并且已经开始具有一些老的精神病院的机构特征。,For-profit community-based services have been developed but some of these are now relatively large with over a hundred occupants and are beginning to reproduce some of the institutional features of the older mental hospitals.
6707,由于财政紧缩限制了在基于社区形式的服务业上的投资，这使得精神病人的问题更加严重化。,Fiscal retrench-ment has served to exacerbate the problems of mentally-ill persons by restricting funds for community-based forms of care.
6707,此外，一些内城地区的绅士化和城市更新也制约了基于社区设施的发展。,"In addition, the gentrification and urban renewal of some inner city areas have led to curbs on these community-based facilities."
6707,其结果导致了无家可归者的增加，他们睡在街边“棚户区”。,"The consequence has been increased homelessness, with people sleeping on the streets in ‘cardboard cities’."
6707,有时汽车载着满车的精神病患者或者显性精神病患者在医院或者监狱之间穿梭——这是一个再机构化的过程。,Sometime the wheel has turned full circle with mentally-ill or ex-psychiatric patients ending up in hospital or prison – a process of reinstitutionalization.
6708,吸引物和目的地包括旅游景点吸引物、自然吸引物、建筑吸引物以及人类文化、遗产吸引物，它们可以为旅游者提供各种不同的旅游体验。,"Attractions and destinations offer a plethora of  travel experiences ranging from  site-specific attractions to natural attractions, built attractions and human cultural/heritage attractions."
6708,在复合而成的旅游体验中有许多交织在一起的相关利益者：旅游供应商、接待供应商、居民和旅游者以及政府机构和部门。,"There is a mix of interested stakeholders within the composite experience: travel suppliers, hospitality suppliers, residents and tourists, and government agencies and departments."
6708,研究旅游吸引物和目的地应该采用多学科的视角，同时存在跨学科研究的潜力。,"Research into tourism attractions and destinations enables a multidisciplinary perspective to be adopted, as well as the potential for interdisciplinary research."
6709,在随机抽样中，研究者可以使用多种表格来帮助决定样本容量。,There are various tables available to researchers to assist in decision making regarding sample size in probability samples.
6709,本章后边罗列了一些这样的表格。随机抽样方法较多，包括：简单随机抽样（simplerandom sampling）、系统抽样（systematic sampling）、分层随机抽样（stratified random sampling）和多阶整群抽样（multistage cluster sampling）。,"Examples of such tables are presented later in the chapter.There are a number of random sampling approaches: simple random sampling, systematic sampling, stratified random sampling and multistage cluster sampling."
6710,我们迫切需要一种社会主义的先锋运动来表达那种政治学。,We badly need a socialist avant-garde movement to express that politics.
6710,但是，它不可能是那种强制推行单一目标的老式先锋政党。,But it cannot be an old-style avant-garde party that imposes a singular goal.
6710,它也不可能仅仅以德里达那种“终极的后结构幻象”作为武装，那是一种“没有特权、资格和头衔……没有政党、国家、民族共同体的新国际”之幻象。,"Nor can it function armed only with Derrida 's ""ultimate post-structuralist fantasy"" of a ""New International without status, without title and without name ... without party, without country, without national community"" (of above, p. 8)."
6710,以解放方式来塑造社会生态和政治经济变迁，需要的不只是思想和话语(不管思想和话语有多重要）。,It will take much more than thought and discourse (however important these may be) to shape socio-ecological and political-economic change in emancipatory ways.
6710,那种版本的先锋派——现在盘踞于学院，在那里，潜心于对思想和理想之流不知怎地被想象为本身就是激进的和革命的——失去了实质性优势。,"That version of avant-gardism, now so entrenched in the academy, in which immersion in the flows of thought and ideality is somehow imagined to be radical and revolutionary in itself has no material purchase."
6711,"显著性检验能够使研究者从统计上判定在样本中变量间的关系是否偶然，从而决定是否将这种关系推论至总体（Neman 2000, p. 338; Babbie 1995, PP. 431 ~436)。","Tests of significance enable the researcher to determine statisticallywhether a relationship between variables is a chance one in the sample as opposed to being probable in the population (Neuman 2000, p. 338;Babbie 1995, pp. 431-6)."
6711,萨兰塔克斯（1998)在表9-7中说明了非参数检验和参数检验。,Sarantakos (1998) refers to non-parametric and parametric tests in table 9.
6711,参数检验假定所研究的变量在总体中表现为正态分布。,7. Parametric tests assume that the variable being studied reflects a normal distribution in the population.
6711,非参数检验假定所研究的变量在总体中并不表现为正态分布。,Non-parametric tests assume that the variable being studied does not reflect a normal distribution in the population.
6712,基本上，在定量研究中，研究者既试图接受（支持、证实）假设，又试图拒绝（不支持、证伪)假设。,"Essentially, in quantitative research, the researcher attempts to either accept (support, confirm) or reject (not support, not confirm) hypotheses."
6712,但永远也不存在最终的证据(Neuman 2000，p.129)。,"There is never an ultimate proof (Neuman 2000, p. 129)."
6712,假设被接受或是拒绝取决于显著性水平及被认定是一类错误还是二类错误（Bums 1997，pp.107-111)。,"Hypotheses are accepted or rejected depending on the levels of significance and consideration of Type I or Type II errors (Burns 1997, pp. 107-111)."
6713,本章将侧重于对时间的第二种看法。,This chapter will focus on this second view of time.
6713,内容包括3部分：第一，描述地理学家研究时间的方法；第二，讨论不同的时间格局；最后，解释我们怎样用关于时间的思想来解释现在。,"The argument consists of three parts: first, the ways in which geographers have studied time are described; second, different patterns of time are discussed; and, finally, we interpret how we use our ideas about time to interpret the present."
6713,但是，在介绍两种基本关系——时间与空间和时间与现代性状态——之前，我们还不能切入主题。,"We cannot begin the argument, however, without introducing two basic relations: time and space, and time and modernity."
6714,但是不断变化的时空秩序安排也是文化、美学和政治激烈争论的焦点。,"But changing spatio-temporal orderings have also been the focus of intense cultural, esthetic, and political debate."
6714,反思这个观点有助于我们理解资本主义时代文化和政治生产领域中产生的某些混乱。,Reflection on this idea helps us under-stand some of the turmoil that has occurred within the fields of cultural and political production in the capitalist era.
6714,回过头来看看，想一想以现代主义(后现代主义被假定为对其的反动)而知名的复杂的文化运动。,"Consider, glancing backwards, that complex cultural movement known as modernism (against which postmodern-ism is supposedly reacting)."
6715,"盖特里尔（Gatrell, 1983)强调这就是“绝对空间”的概念。",Gatrell (1983) stresses that this is the concept of absolute space.
6715,人文地理学家迅速发展了关于空间与距离的新概念——例如，“时间距离”、“费用或经济距离”、“认知距离或感知距离”和“社会距离”等——所有这些都把距离视为一种相对的现象(“相对空间”）。,"Human geographers quickly developed new ideas about space and distance – for example, ‘time-distance’, ‘cost or economic distance’, ‘cognitive or perceptual distance’ and ‘social distance’  – all of which treat space as a relative phenomenon (relative space)."
6715,最后，这些进展导致了人文地理学家对空间分析的反对，其中许多人现在把空间视为一种社会结构。,"Ultimately, these developments have led to widespread rejection of spatial analysis by human geographers, many of whom now regard space as a social construct."
6716,正是从这种内部关系出发，他反对牛顿的思想：时空天生就存在，它们是内容中立的容器，并不关心放置在其中的东西是什么。,"It was from this standpoint of internal relations that he opposed the Newtonian view that space and time existed in their own right, that they were content neutral containers indifferent with respect to whatever it was that was placed within them."
6716,相反，他主张，空间总是视实体或物质而定，不过并不是以相对论所理解的那种方式来决定。当地理学家们使用“相对空间”来表明空间如何根据穿其而过的物质而弯曲或变形时，空间也不是由它们来决定的。,"He argued instead that space was always contingent on substance or matter, not, however, in the way understood in relativity theory or by geographers when they use the term ""relative space"" to indicate how space gets bent or warped depending on the matter being traversed."
6717,美国环境正义运动产生的这些条件说明了它的一些主要特点。,These conditions of production of an environmental justice movement in the United States account for some of its central features.
6717,首先，对某些特殊污染——有毒物和危险的污染物——的集中关注把讨论压到了象征问题上，清楚说明了，就如污染那样，这个问题也是有关“地位的诉求和反诉求”的(Douglas，1984:3)。,"To begin with, the focus on particular kinds of pollution — toxics and dangerous contaminants — loads the discussion towards symbolic questions, making clear that the issue is as much about ""claims and counter-claims to status"" (cf. Douglas, 1984: 3), as it is about pollution per se."
6717,这就是使运动具有如此巨大道德力量和道德义愤能量的东西。,This is what gives the movement so much of its moral force and capacity for moral outrage.
6717,但是，如萨兹(Szasz，1994)指出的那样，必然结果是，这项运动严重地依赖污染事件的符号政治学和强有力的媒体肖像。,"But the corollary, as Szasz (1994) points out, is that the movement relies heavily upon symbolic politics and powerful media icons of pollution incidents."
6718,我们可以来看一看《纽约时报》1960年8月对一场火灾的报道，这场火灾烧伤了一个出租房里的六个人，这个房子的所有者是市政府。,Consider this item from the New York Times in August 1960 about a fire which had injured six persons in a tenement owned by the city.
6718,"报道说,“在2月份消防部门(fire department)给住房部门的一份报告中就指出这个住房处有火灾隐患。”","The tenement, reports the paper,"" had been described as a firetrap in February in a Fire Department report to the Department of Buildings."""
6719,随着分配的变动，例如，随着资本的积聚，随着城乡人口的不同的分配等等，生产也就发生变动。,"A change in distribution changes production, e.g.concentration of capital, different distribution of the population between town and country, etc."
6719,最后，消费的需要决定着生产。,"Finally, the needs of consumption determine production."
6719,不同要素之间存在着相互作用。,Mutual interaction takes place between the different moments.
6720,在自然提供的其他时间体系中，将有一种绵延性。它为全部感觉事件的次要部分提供最平均的协同。,Amid the alternative time-systems that nature offers there will be one with a duration giving the best average cogredience for all the subordinate parts of the percipient event.
6720,这种绵延将是整个自然总体，它是感知所设定的终点。,This duration will be the whole of nature which is the terminus posited by sense-awareness.
6720,因此，感觉事件的特点决定着直接在自然中呈现的时间体系。,Thus the character of the percipient event determines the time-system immediately evident in nature.
6721,"私有化最明显的形式是资产变卖（asset sales),即将公共部门资产卖给私人部门。",
6721,例如，英国最重要的、也是最引人注目的资产变卖是在第六章所讨论的地方当局住房的变卖。,"For example, one of the most important manifestations of asset sales in the United Kingdom has been the sale of local authority housing, as discussed in Chapter 6."
6721,私有化也可能采用协议出让(comracting-om)的形式，将原先由公共部门承担的责任转给私人组织。,Privatization can also take the form of contracting-out – awarding tasks that were previously undertaken by the public sector to private sector organizations.
6721,通常这样的转让是基于被称为竞争性投标（competitive tendering)的私下协议。,Often these contracts are awarded on the basis of secret bidding known as competitive tendering.
6722,在所有情况下（以阴影曲面表示)泥沙搬运随河流动力加大而增加（图中平行于X轴从前向后）。,"In all cases (represented by the shaded curved surface), sediment transport increases as stream power increases (going from front to back of the figure, parallel to x )."
6722,在X2的低值区（分选不好）总有一些泥沙与河流动力相匹配因而能被携带（拾起），因此曲线相对地平滑。,"At low values of x (poorly sorted), there is always some sediment that matches the available stream power and which, therefore, can be entrained (picked up), so the curve is relatively smooth."
6722,随着分选程度增加（沿X2轴向右），颗粒大小变得更集中于某一个粒级。,With better sorting (further along the x2 axis) the grain size becomes more concentrated at one size group.
6722,只有当河流动力足以携带该粒级时含沙量才会增加。,Only when the stream power is sufficient to entrain that grain size can the sediment load increase.
6722,随着平均粒径对分选（X2）的比率增大，携带的阈限（搬运某一粒径开始的数值）也增大。,The threshold of entrainment (the value at which transport of a given particle size begins) increases as the ratio of mean grain size/sorting (x2) increases.
6723,研究是一个双重行为。,Conducting research is a twofold activity.
6723,首先，进行研究是为了收集资料或信息。,"First, you undertake the research process in order to gather data or information."
6723,其次，通过写作，可使研究从与信息需要有关的研究目标或假说，转向信息收集方法的而促进研究成果报告的完成。,"Second, you use the writing process to move you from the construction of research aims or hypotheses related to your information needs to the development of your data collection tool(s) and then to the reporting of your findings."
6724,对一个城市地区的信贷封杀(credit blacklisting )针对的不是个人而是地方本身。,Credit blacklisting of city localities is impersonal.
6724,"它并不是作用于单个的居民或经商者,而是整个街区。","It operates not against the residents or businessmen, as persons, but against their neighborhoods."
6724,"比如，我认识一个纽约东哈莱姆的一个商人，这个地区刚好是被信贷封杀的地方，这位商人因此得不到用来拓展他正红火的业务和翻新营业场所需要的15,000美元的贷款，但同样是他，在长岛却能很轻松地拿到30,000美元贷款建起一幢住宅房。","For example, a merchant with whom I am acquainted in the blacklisted district of East Harlem in New York, unable to get a $15,000 loan for expanding and modernizing his successful business there, had no difficulty raising 30,000 to build a house on Long Island."
6725,首先，本章重点强调了定量（实证论的或推理演绎的）与定性（非实证论的或整体归纳的）研究方法的主要区别。,"Initially, this chapter highlights the major differences between the quantitative (positivistic or hypothetico-deductive) and the qualitative (nonpositivistic or holistic-inductive) approaches to research."
6725,同时探讨了混合方法的运用。,It also considers the use of mixed methods.
6725,接着本章讨论抽样方法以及关于定量与定性研究的信度和效度问题.,"The chapter then moves on to discuss sampling, and reliability and validity issues associated with qualitative and quantitative research."
6726,从泽尔纳开始，汉诺领导了两次向南的远征。,From Ceme Hanno led two expeditions farther to the south.
6726,在第二次远征中，他到达了歇尔布罗岛，位于今天塞拉利昂弗里敦之南，距离赤道只有七度。,"On the second of the two voyages he reached Sherbo Island, south of the present site of Freetown in Sierra Leone, almost seven degrees from the equator."
6726,在这里他们看到了“身上长满毛的男人和女人”，他们被告知这些人被称为猩猩。,"Here the explorers came upon “wild men and women with hairy bodies,” who, they were told, were called gorillas."
6727,结果是，家庭将住房搜索活动集中在有限的搜索空间内，并且因对不同地区的熟悉程度不同而发生空间上的偏向。,The upshot is that households concentrate their house-hunting activities within a limited search space that is spatially biased by their familiarity with different districts.
6727,在行为主义者的术语中，搜索空间是更宽泛的意识空间的子集。意识空间通常被认为是以下二者的产物：人们的活动空间（activity space)或行动空间（即人们在日常活动中经常到达的地方的集合）；和通过诸如广播、电视、报纸甚至口头传播所获得的信息。,"In behaviouralist terminology, this search space is a subset of a more general awareness space, which is usually regarded as a product of: people’s activity space or action space (the sum of all the places with which people have regular contact as a result of their normal activities); and information from secondary sources such as radio, television, newspapers and even word-of-mouth."
6728,推动组织的变革有许多途径。,There are various ways to instigate change in an organisation.
6728,变革是一个过程，但也同时与特殊的研究方式——行动研究有关。,"Change is a process, but it is also associated with a particular research approach — action research."
6728,行动研究首先是一种解决问题的方法（Burns 1990，1997; Kemmis & Me Taggart 1988; Whyte 1989)。,"Action research is primarily grounded in a problem-solving approach (Burns 1990, 1997; Kemmis & McTaggart 1988; Whyte 1989)."
6728,从本质上看，行动研究是由同一组织内部具有共同兴趣的一群人设计一个计划，用以改进运营或实践的某些方面。,"In essence, action research involves a group of people with a common interest within an organisation devising a plan to improve some aspect of operation or practice."
6728,该计划继而被执行、监督和反馈，这可能导致对于行动研究过程的另一个循环。,"The plan is subsequently implemented, monitored and reflected upon , which may result in another iteration of the action research process."
6729,从事行动研究的研究者可能选择使用书面形式、口头形式或可视化的报告。但是对于其中的一些研究者来说，对研究对象做出改变可能是研究的唯一要求，而不需要报告研究结果。,"Researchers who engage in action research may choose to use written, oral or visual reports, and, for some, the change in the issue being studied may be the only outcome required and no report eventuates."
6729,但是，这里仍然为行动研究报告提供了一种建议性格式。,"However, a suggested format for action research reports is provided here."
6729,就像案例研究一样，行动研究报告可以以科学实验报告的结构为模型（引言、文献综述、方法、结果分析及未来研究计划），也可选择其他不同的模型。,"As with case studies, the report may be based on the scientific experimental model (introduction, literature review, method, findings and analysis, and future action plans), but there are alternative models."
6730,在城市里，除了承载交通外，街道还有许多别的用途。城市中的人行道——街道中行人走路的部分——除了承载行人(pedestrians)走路外，也有其他很多用途。这些用途是与交通循环紧密相关的，但是并不能互相替代，就其本质来说，这些用途和交通循环系统一样，是城市正常运转机制的基本要素。,"Streets in cities serve many purposes besides carrying vehicles,and city sidewalks---the pedestrian parts of the streets---serve many purposes besides carrying pedestrians.These uses are bound up with circulation but are not identical with it and in their own right they arc  at least as basic as circulation to the proper workings of cities."
6731,作为少数的移民群体能否保持他们“特殊的社会和空间实体”则取决于同化所发生的程度。,The maintenance of the minority immigrant group as a distinctive social and spatial entity will depend on the degree to which assimilation occurs.
6731,这过程依据该群体和特权群体之间所感觉的社会距离，在不同群体中产生不同的同化速度。,"This process can take place at different speeds for different groups, depending on the perceived social distance between them and the charter group."
6731,"而且，行为同化（behavioural assimilation,即少数群体获得与特权群体一致的文化生活），可能要比结构同化（structural assimilation, 指少数群体的成员扩散到特权群体社会的各种社会和职业阶层中）更快。","Moreover, behavioural assimilation --- the acquisition by the minority group of a cultural life in common with the charter group --- may take place faster than structural assimilation --- the diffusion of members of the minority group through the social and occupational strata of the charter group society."
6732,"“生态现代化”(Hajer, 1992;Weale, 1992:第3章)就是这种政治学的意识形态口号。","""Ecological modernization"" (Hajer, 1992; Weale, 1992: chapter 3) is the ideological watchword for such a politics."
6732,保护自然资源和环境调控(国家以及全球规模)在此将被解释成为可持续未来进行既理性又有效的资源管理。,Conservation and environmental regulation (at global as well as at national scale) would here be interpreted as both rational and efficient resource management for a sustainable future.
6732,例如，公司资本的某些部门，特别是通过提供对地球健康进行监视所必须的技术而持续获益的那些部门，它们发现全球管理意象或者“地球医学”很有吸引力(参阅本书第十三章)。,"Certain sectors of corporate capital, particularly those which stand to benefit from providing the technology necessary for global monitoring of planetary health, find the imagery of global management or ""planetary medicine"" very attractive, for example (see below, chapter 13)."
6733,行政文件这些文件产生于商业领域，与公共或私人部门以及非营利组织相关。,Administrative documents These documents are generated in the business environment and are associated with the public and private sectors as well as the non-profit sector.
6733,行政文件包括年度报告、备忘录、会议记录和会议议程、商业信函和内部文件。,"Administrative documents include annual reports, memoranda, meeting notes and agenda, business correspondence and in-house documentation."
6733,通常，这些文件需经所有者或“管理者”的允许方能获得。,"Usually, these documents are accessed by permission f rom  the auspicating body or via a 'gatekeeper'."
6733,同样，获得和使用它们可能也需要成本，有些文件可能被禁止使用。,"Again, there may be costs associated with accessing and using these documents.There may also be sanctions against their use."
6734,在拟稿和修订阶段，作者的主要目标是确保文章淸楚地表达了他们的意图。,"During the drafting and the revising stages, the writer's key focus should be on clarifying their intent to ensure that the text clearly conveys their meaning."
6734,在定稿阶段，作者旨在检査标点、句法和语法的问题。,"In the proofing stage, the writer attends to the issues of punctuation, syntax and grammar."
6734,"在出版阶段，作者应以个人或专业的方式完成最终文本,并进行润饰而将其展示给合适的读者。",The publishing stage involves the writer producing either personally or professionally the final document in polished form for dissemination to the appropriate audiences.
6735,表5-2提供了计算商店均衡数量的数字示例。,Table 5-2 provides a numerical example that shows bow to compute the equilibrium number of stores.
6735,人均需求4张CD，人口密度为每平方英里50人，则需求密度（demand density)(每平方英里CD需求量，等d乘以e)是200。,"Per capita demand is four CDs and population density is 50 people per square mile, so demand density (CD demand per square mile, equal to d times e) is 200."
6735,如果该地区面积为300平方英里，那么总需求最是60000张CD（200乘以300)。,"The region has an area of 300 square miles, so total demand is 60,000 CDs (200 times 300)."
6736,在这些方面，权力常被概念化为“纪律性权力”，是一种到处扩散的、不确定位置的力量，它渗透到各个层次的社会阶层，并且在多重的、调解斡旋的网络中以间接的而且往往让人捉摸不定的方式被重新创造出来。,"Power is conceptualized as a diffuse and unlocatable force, that permeates all levels of society and that is reproduced in indirect and often erratic ways through multiple mediatory networks."
6736,这样，所有个体都处于既运用权力又受制于权力的地位。,"In this way, all individuals are both in a position of simultaneously exercising power but also being subject to it."
6736,对抗强调的是，个人或小团体在这些或其他来源的权力和压制之下，对其处境进行改造的方式。,Resistance places the emphasis on the way individuals and groups find ways of reworking their situation in the face of power and oppression.
6737,人类行为被看做是基于“实践知觉”之上的，这意味着我们对自身的行为和他人的行为产生感知的方式，以及我们概括世界意义的方式，都根植于H复一H的惯常化实践中，而这些时间占据着我们头脑中有意识与非意识之间的某个地方。,"Human action is seen as being based on ‘practical consciousness’, meaning that the way in which we make sense of our own actions and the actions of others, and the way we generate meaning in the world is rooted in routinized day-to-day practices that occupy a place in our minds somewhere between the conscious and the unconscious."
6737,个人实践与社会实践通过惯常化行为 (时空惯常化）重复而持续地再生产，对社会一体化以及特定地方行为主体之间的社会系统与结构的发展做出贡献。,"Recursivity, the continual reproduction of individual and social practices through routine actions (time–space routinization), contributes to social integration, the development of social systems and structures among agents in particular locales."
6737,另外，结构和社会系统可以通过系统一体化跨越更广阔的空间和时间而发展。这种系统一体化是通过时空延展而发生：随着理念、态度和概念等通过印刷品和电子媒介的广泛传播，,"In addition, structures and social systems can be seen to develop across broader spans of space and time through system integration, which takes place through time–space distanciation: the ‘stretching’ of social relations over time and space as ideas, attitudes and norms are spread through print and electronic media, for example."
6738,正如自然环境中有各种表征单个地方的方式一样，对相互关联的地区也有各种表征方法——用系统模型来表示。,"Just as there are ways of characterizing individual places in physical environments, there are also ways in which adjacent places are interrelated, expressed in system models."
6738,这种关联可能表现为构成相互嵌套的级序系统一部分的流域，也可能通过能流互相联系，像一系列小瀑布那样，从一个子系统的输出变成下一个子系统的输入。,"Such relationships may arise as drainage basins forming part of a nested hierarchy, or they may be linked by energy flows in the way that cascading systems have been recognized as structures with output from one subsystem forming input to the next."
6738,能够鉴别出气候（气候序列）、地形（地形序列）、岩石（岩石序列）、生态（生态序列）和时间（时间序列）等方面地方特征的序列。,"Sequences of the character of places can be identified for climate (climosequences), relief (toposequences), lithology (lithosequences), ecology (biosequences), and time (chronosequences)."
6739,研究是一种运用科学的严谨性和学术的敏锐性去收集关于某些现象信息的活动。,Research is an activity that gathers information on a phenomenon using scientific rigour and academic acumen.
6739,在社会科学中有用以描述可操作的研究类型的各种分类系统。,"Within the social sciences, various classification systems exist to describe the types of research that can be undertaken."
6739,例如，研究可被分为纯理论的和应用性的研究；或分为探索性的、描述性的、解释性的、因果关系的、比较性的、评价性的和预测性的研究。,"For example, research may be described as pure or applied; or as exploratory, descriptive, explanatory, causal, comparative, evaluative or predictive."
6739,研究也可被分为定性研究和定量研究，或两相结合(混合性）的研究。,Research can also be described as being qualitative or quantitative or mixed method research.
6739,以上这些分类会使刚刚接触学术论文的人感到困惑。,All these descriptors can be confusing to a person who is engaging with research literature/texts for the first time.
6740,正如你所看到的，上述引文与本章开头的引言之间存在着某些相似性。通过学习旅游研究方法，你将对提升澳大利亚整体旅游研究水平作出贡献。,"As you can see, there is some similarity between this quote and the quote at the start of the chapter, and by studying tourism research you are contributing to the improvement of the research capabilities of Australian tourism."
6740,接下来的行业透视，探讨了一些能对澳大利亚旅游发展作出贡献的其他途径。,The following Industry Insight discusses another way you can contribute to the development of tourism within Australia.
6741,,To enable the research to go 'public'.
6741,使研究结果公布于众：在进行旅游研究时，研究者是对公众或影响公众的现象进行研究，所以研究者应该将研究结果反馈给公众。,"In conducting tourism research,researchers are studying the public or phenomena that impact on the public, so researchers should give something back."
6741,研究结果的公布与研究道德，特别是与互惠性有关。,"Disclosure of research findings is associated with research ethics, particularly reciprocity."
6741,研究报告也使研究者将他们的研究结果传播给范围更广的读者。,Research reports also enable researchers to disseminate their findings to a wider audience.
6742,《纽伦堡法典》的两个最直接的贡献就是研究参与者的自愿参与和知情同意。,Two direct outcomes of the Nuremberg Code are voluntary participation and informed consent by research participants.
6742,"“知情同意是研究中最基本的伦理准则。参与者应该完全了解研究的目的和本质，并且是在不受强制情况下同意参与”（Burns 1997, p.18)。","' [Informed consent] is the most fundamental ethical principle that is involved [in research]. Participants must understand the nature and purpose of the research and must consent to participate without coercion' (Burns 1997, p. 18)."
6743,旅游研究中可以使用的不同研究方法。,The different research methodologies that can be used in tourism research.
6743,基本上，有两种类型的研究方法：定性方法和定量方法。,"Primarily, there are two classifications for research methodologies: qualitative and quantitative methodologies."
6743,定性研究通常用于解释社会学，批评理论，女性主义视角和后现代主义范式。,"Qualitative methodologies are predicated to the interpretive social sciences, critical theory, feminist perspectives and postmodern paradigms."
6744,总而言之，解释社会学范式是建立在社会行为的真实世界背景之上的。,"To summarise, the interpretive social sciences paradigm is founded in the real-world setting of social action."
6744,这种范式要求研究者成为被研究的社会群体的一部分，保持主观性并使用定性研究方法论。,"The paradigm requires the researcher to become part of the social group being studied, to be subjective and to use a qualitative research methodology."
6744,因此，这种范式所构建的有关世界的理论借助的是归纳的方法。,
6744,,"As a result, knowledge of the world is thereby constructed inductively."
6745,在研究计划的准备过程中，务必确保信息的完整性，提供包括引言、文献综述、方法论、工作进度表、经费预算表、参考文献和简历等方面的信息。,"When preparing your research proposal, ensure that you provide information on all sections: the introduction, literature review, methodology, time line, budget, references and curriculum vitae."
6745,保证准时提交研究计划，过晚提交的计划一般不会被接受。,"Ensure that the pro- posal is submitted on time, as late submissions are generally not accepted."
6745,同时确保研究计划整体形式的专业性，所有必要的附件一应俱全。,"Furthermore, ensure that the proposal has been professionally presented and all attachments have been included."
6745,在计划书最后，还需附求职信一封，说明申请者的兴趣、核心能力及具体联系方式。,"To complete the overall proposal, prepare a covering letter indicating your interest, key skills and contact details."
6746,实施研究设计集中体现在两个主要的活动上：资料收集和资料分析。,Implementing the research design is focused on two major activities: data collection and data analysis.
6746,两种活动都涉及研究的伦理问题，也与资料收集和分析过程中的研究者行为的伦理相关。,Both activities are associated with ethical issues relating to permission to conduct the study and to the researcher acting ethically during data collection and analysis.
6746,在这一阶段中，研究者也需要组织一次前测。,"Also in this phase, the researcher will be involved in running a pilot of the study."
6746,从某种意义上来说，前测是就最终要进行调査研究的同一个总体进行的实验性资料收集和分析过程。,The pilot is in a sense a trial run of the data collection tools (and analysis) using the same sample population that will be used in the final study.
6746,研究设计的实施包括“田野工作”和收集资料（在前面的例子中，进行焦点群体调查或进行电话调査以及进行资料分析，都属于这种情况）。,"Implementing the research design involves 'field work' and completing the data collection (in the above examples, either running a focus group or conducting a telephone survey, and commencing and completing the data analysis)."
6747,在探讨未来所要进行的旅游研究之前，本章对旅游和接待部门当前以及潜在的研究需要加以关注。,"Prior to discussing tourism research in the future, the chapter focuses on the current and potential research needs of the travel and hospitality sectors."
6747,在这两个部门中存在大量的项目有待研究，下面将列举部分例子。,There is a large variety of research projects to be undertaken in both sectors.Some examples are presented below.
6747,这些例子还都仅仅是一些建议，并不能代表每一部门中所能确定的所有研究问题。,The examples are suggestions only and do not represent a comprehensive listing of all research opportunities within each of the sectors identified.
6747,"在阅读每一部分的时候,还需思考其他的研究问题。","As you read through each sector, you should be able to think of other research opportunities."
6748,所有研究的开展都必须要遵守一定的伦理规范。,All research must be undertaken in an ethical manner.
6748,对应用性研究来说更是如此，因为委托人可能会在研究设计或报告中倾向于某种偏见。,"This is especially relevant for applied research, as the client may angle for a bias in the research design or reporting."
6748,研究者是受道德标准约束的，因而这种倾向是不可接受的。,Researchers are bound by ethical standards and such angling is not acceptable.
6748,研究者在进行符合道德规范的研究时，必须对他们自己、学术界、公众和发起人负责。,"Researchers must be responsible to themselves, the scientific community, the public and their sponsors in conducting ethical research."
6749,时间是一个框架，其中地貌事件常常被用以推断因果关系。,Time is a framework in which geomorphological events are often placed to infer cause-and-effect relationships.
6749,历史地貌学（historic geomorphology）用这个框架重构过去。演化地貌学（evolutionary geomorphology）试图根据过程演绎来论证地形如何随时间而发育——时间的轨迹是什么?,Historic geomorphology uses this framework to recon- struct the past.Evolutionary geomorphology attempts to argue from process deduc- tions about how landforms develop in time – what are the trajectories through time?
6750,研究者一般总是始于某个假设，这个假设是运用演绎法得出的，建立在经验事实的基础之上。,"The researcher usually commences with a hypothesis, which has been deductively derived and based on empirically validated facts."
6750,演绎的过程包括对关于自然界和社会运转方式的理论的检验。,The process of deduction involves the testing of theories about the way the natural and social worlds operate.
6750,利用一个理论，研究者将提出一种假设，这一假设随后将被检验，以测定提出这一假设所依据的理论解释某种具体行为或现象的准确性。,"Using a theory, the researcher will generate a hypothesis that is then tested to determine the veracity of the theory for explaining a specific behaviour or phenomena."
6750,换句话说，理论是经过演绎得出的，并在经验领域得到检验。,"That is, theory is deduced and then tested in the empirical world."
6751,其他学者如纳克斯（1952）则强调有弹性的资本供给。,"Other authors, such as Nurkse (1952), stressed the elasticity of capital supply."
6751,特别值得一提的是，赫希曼（1958）不厌其烦地强调投资机会可以在多大程度上带来更多的储蓄。,"In particular, Hirschman (1958) emphasized at length the extent to which investment opportunities could bring forth additional savings."
6751,再说句题外话，20世纪50年代，许多发展经济学家大概已经意识到有弹性的要素供给对发展过程中的外部经济而言也十分重要。,"Again it may be stretching the point, but many development theorists in the 1950s seem to have been aware that elasticity of factor supply was also crucial to an external economy story of development."
6752,在考虑测量问题的同时又产生若干问题，即分辨率、仪器设备、准确度和精密度、维度等问题，这些问题对自然科学和地理学的对比而言，都是相互联系的。,"Several further issues arise when considering measurement; those of resolution, instrumentation, precision and accuracy, and dimensionality all provide interrelated grounds for comparison of the physical sciences and geography."
6752,科学上的简化论者（reductionist）倾向于把科学推向研究越来越小尺度的、要求观察测量技术分辨率越来越高的现象。,"The reductionist tendency in science has driven it to examine phenomena of ever-smaller scale, demanding increasing resolution of techniques for observation and measurement."
6752,与此相联系的是把观察中视觉的感知和开发一些仪器帮助“观看”这些现象置于首要地位。,"Linked with this is the primacy of the visual sense in observation, and the development of instruments to assist in ‘seeing’ these phenomena."
6753,我们能够理解“物”之(矛盾的)质和量属性的唯一方式是理解构造它们的和内在于它们的过程和关系。,"The only way we can understand the (contradictory) qualitative and quantitative attributes of ""things"" is by understanding the processes and relationships which constitute them and which they internalize."
6753,除了通过内在于我的新陈代谢的、社会的和其他的过程，否则就不能理解作为个体的我。,"I, as an individual, cannot be understood except by way of the metabolic, social, and other processes which I internalize."
6753,无论如何，这暗示着，我必然使异质性以及一系列关联在一起的矛盾内在化。,"This implies, however, that I necessarily internalize heterogeneity and a bundle of associated contradictions."
6754,多元回归分析是多元分析的另一种形式。,Multiple regression is another form of multivariate analysis.
6754,多元回归分析调査研究了几个自变量对因变量的影响。,Multiple regression investigates the effect of several independent variables on a dependent variable.
6754,它用于定距和定比测量层次的数据，且通常使用统计软件包进行计算。,It is used with data measured at interval and ratio levels and is generally calculated using statistical software packages.
6755,同样，许多批评主流经济学狭隘的人并不理解这个领域是什么或能做什么。,It is also the case that many of those who criticize mainstream economics for its narrowness don't understand what the field is or can do.
6755,在最粗浅的水平上，他们根本不了解经济学是什么：杰伊•福雷斯特（Jay Forrester) 是系统动力学的创始人，他曾经在给一个批评其工作的经济学家的回答中称“诺德豪斯（Nordhaus）和所有的经济学家一样，只从单向因果关系来思考问题——他不明白变量之间可能同时相互影响。”,"At the crudest level, they simply have no idea what economics is about: Jay Forrester, founder of system dynamics, once replied to an economist who criticized his work by asserting that ""Nordhaus, like all economists, only thinks in terms of one-way causation, he doesn't understand that variables may simultaneously affect each other."""
6756,确实，每一个卓越的理论家都倾向诉诸一种特殊的“永恒”（环节）结构，把各种“环节”之间的关系固定下来，从而使社会获得结构化秩序。,"Each major theorist, it is true, tends to appeal to a particular structure of permanences"" (elements) that transfix relations between the various moments"" to give a structured order to a society."
6756,常常会出现这种情况：使这种或那种环节具有优先地位，成为社会变迁的核心。,
6756,,And there is often some sort of privileging of one or other moment as the locus of social change.
6756,这样一种结构化的系统似乎把社会过程囚禁在再生产的循环因果关系的铁笼之中（如马克思的“资本的逻辑”、韦伯的“官僚制的一技术的合理性”，或者斯潘德的“语言的牢笼”）。,"Such a structured system seems to imprison the social process in an iron cage of reproductive circular causality (such as Marx's ""logic of capital,"" Weber's ""bureaucratic-technocratic rationality"" or Spender's ""prison-house of language"")."
6757,隐私(privacy)在城市中是很珍贵的、不可缺少的。,Privacy is precious in cities.
6757,也许在任何地方它都是非常珍贵和不可缺少的，但是在很多地方，人们得不到隐私。在一些小地方，每个人都知道别人的事情。,"It is indispensable.Perhaps it is precious and indispensable everywhere, but in most places you cannot get it.In small settlements everyone knows your affairs."
6758,另一方面，当参与者不被告知或者压根没觉察（意识）到他们已经被研究时，就属于隐性研究。,"Covert research, on the other hand, involves research in which the participants are not informed or aware of their participation."
6758,帕顿(1990)提到，关于隐性研究的使用，学术界存在两种截然相反的观点。,"As Patton (1990) notes, there are two diametrically opposing opinions regarding the use of covert research in the scientific community."
6758,一种观点反对使用隐性研究，另一种观点则持支持的态度。,One opinion rejects the use of covert research and the other supports it.
6758,"相应的，这些观点在史尔斯（1959, in 1990)和道格拉斯（1976, in Patton 1990)的文章中得到了充分的描述，在没有得到被观察者明确允许的情况下，史尔斯不主张对私人行动进行观察，尽管这在技术上是可行的，因为这属于一种“缺乏道德考虑的操作”（Shils 1959, in Patton 1990, p. 210)。","These views are best portrayed by the opinions of Shils (1959, in Patton 1990) and Douglas (1976, in Patton 1990), respectively.Shils rejects the use of 'observations of private behavior, however technically feasible, without the explicit and fully informed permission of the person to be observed', as it is 'morally obnoxious . . . manipulation' (Shils 1959, in Patton 1990, p. 210)."
6759,应用性研究是用来收集与某些问题、论题或规划有关的信息的一般性研究。,"Applied research is generally research that is designed to gather information relating to a problem, issue or planning need."
6759,这类研究的操作主体一般包括:学术机构、学者、研究机构、政府部门和本地、州、国家等各层次的实体、旅游业组织和协会、旅游经营商、旅游业部门协会、社区。,"This type of research is undertaken by academics, scholars, research agencies, government agencies and bodies at the local, regional and national level, tourism organisations and associations, tourism operators, tourism industry sector associations, and the community."
6759,为了从事应用性研究而收集信息的研究者，也可能是受某些赞助人或委托人的委托而进行此项研究，下面的行业透视就可以说明这一点。,"Researchers who engage in data collection for applied research may be working for a sponsor or a client, as is illustrated by the following Industry Insight."
6760,在这个模型中产生外部经济有两个必要条件。,Two conditions are necessary to generate external economies in this model.
6760,第一，生产中必须存在规模经济。,"First, there must be economies of scale in production."
6760,这很直观：如果现代部门没有固定成本，那么现代厂商是否获利并不取决于采用现代技术的其他厂商的数量。,"This is obvious from the geometry: if there were no fixed costs in the modern sector, the profitability of modern firms would not depend on how many other firms were using modern techniques."
6761,卡尔霍恩（1962）在他著名的鼠类行为研究中论述到，拥挤会导致进攻倾向以及失聪、同性恋和撕咬幼崽等。,"Calhoun (1962), for example, in his celebrated studies of rat behaviour, showed that crowding led to aggression, listlessness, promiscuity, homosexuality and the rodent equivalent of juvenile delinquency."
6761,将这类观点直接用来解释人类行为，就会导致人们认为拥挤是“杀人狂”。,Projecting these ideas directly to human behaviours leads to the idea of crowded urbanites as ‘killer apes’.
6761,反对拥挤理论的批评认为，将动物行为直接扩展到人类本身就犯了很明显的错误：人类不是鼠类；人类是否天生有领地感觉尚不能确定；现实中最拥挤的贫民窟也达不到试验中动物所处的拥挤程度。,Critics of crowding theory have emphasized the obvious dangers involved in extending animal behaviour to humans: people are not rats; it is by no means certain that humans possess any innate sense of territoriality; and in any case even the most crowded slums do not approach the levels of crowding to which experimental animals have been subjected.
6762,结构化系统以及作为其组成部分的单个物，它们的辩证概念完全建立在对过程和关系理解之上，借助这些过程和关系，物和结构化系统才得以构造。这个观点在直觉上并非自明的，因为我们总是处在“物”的包围之中，这些物似乎具有永久的和固定的特点，很难想象它们是流动的。因此，我们不能轻视怀特海(1985:137)所言“永恒”之物的意义，即我们每天会遇到无数的“实际上不灭的物体”，离开它们，物质和生物生命可能不再如我们现在所知的那样存在。,"A dialectical conception of both the individual ""thing and the structured system of which it is a part rests entirely on an understanding of the processes and relations by which thing and structured system are constituted. This idea is not intuitively self-evident since we are surrounded by ""things"" that seem to have such a permanent and solid character that it is difficult to imagine them as somehow in flux. We cannot downplay, therefore, the significance of what Whitehead (1985: 137) calls ""permanences"" – the innumerable ""practically indestructible objects"" that we daily encounter in the world and without which physical and biological life would not and could not exist as we now know it."
6763,1914年，怀特海发表了一篇题为“相关性空间理论”的论文。,"Whitehead published a paper entitled ""La Théorie Relationniste de l'Espace"" in 1914."
6763,他的主要评注者和传记作者维克多•洛威认为论文写得又臭又长，但它在怀特海从早期向后期的过渡中占据了关键的位置。早期是与罗素合作写《数学原理》的怀特海，后期则是对过程和有机论哲学进行详细解释的怀特海。,"Judged poorly written and overlong by his primary expositor and biographer Victor Lowe (1962: 178), it nevertheless occupied a pivotal transitional role between the early Whitehead that collaborated with Russell on Principia Mathematica and the later Whitehead that expounded upon a philosophy of process and organism."
6764,第一种做法是对理论解释能力的判断。,The first is a judgement about the explanatory power of a theory.
6764,这就提出了解释与预测之间的不对称性问题；正如任何统计学预测模型在经济学或水文学中所展示的那样，解释的能力并不意味着预测的能力。,"This introduces the asymmetry between explanation and prediction; the capacity to predict does not imply an ability to explain, as any statistical forecasting model in economics or hydrology demonstrates."
6764,所以，对旨在提供解释的理论的预测检验生来就是自相矛盾的，而且还需要某些东西。,"A predictive test of a theory that purports to provide explanation is inherently inconsistent, therefore, and something is required in addition."
6765,预测法包括预言的使用。,Forecasting involves the use of prediction.
6765,预言的质量取决于建构或应用预言机制的人的技巧和专门技术(Mill & Morrison 1992)。,The quality of the predictions is dependent on the skill and expertise of those who have constructed or applied the mechanisms for making the predictions (Mill & Morrison 1992).
6765,基本上，预测法可以使用数学方程、统计法或专家估测(Mill & Morrison 1992)。,"Essentially, forecasting can be conducted using mathematical formulae, statistical methods or expert guesstimates (Mill & Morrison 1992)."
6766,域分析由詹姆斯•斯普莱德雷提出（Neuman 2000)。,Domain analysis is founded in the work of James Spradley (Neuman 2000).
6766,斯普莱德雷（Spradley 1980)使用域作为描述文化环境主要的分类单元。,Spradley (1980) used domains as the main classifying unit for describing cultural settings.
6766,文化环境中包含着各种不同的域。,"Within cultural settings, various domains can be determined."
6766,域主要用于组织构想或概念。,Domains are primarily organising ideas or concepts.
6767,在进行假设检验的过程中，通常至少涉及两个变量——自变量和因变量。,"If you are testing a hypothesis, there will be at least two variables —an independent variable and a dependent variable."
6767,"实际上，“定量研究的语言就是变量以及变量间关系的语言”（Neuman 2000, p.126)。","In fact, ' the language of quantitative research is a language of variables and relationships among variables' (Neuman 2000, p. 126)."
6767,自变量有时也被称为原因变量（Neuman 2000)或改变变量（Kumar 1996)。,The independent variable is sometimes referred to as the causal variable (Neuman 2000) or change variable (Kumar 1996).
6767,因变量也可称为结果变量（Kumar 1996)。,The dependent variable is also referred to as the outcome variable (Kumar 1996).
6768,在位：术语“在位”、“出位”建立于人类学的基础上，意指关于一个现象的数据收集方法。,Emic: The terms emic and etic are founded in anthropology and refer to ways of gathering data about a phenomenon.
6768,在位视角以研究背景为基础。,An emic perspective grounds the study in the setting being studied.
6768,有时候是指研究者成为一个研究群体/背景的一员或“局内人”，运用基于背景的相关知识，并利用被研究的群体的视角和语言来描述所研究的现象。,"It is sometimes referred to as 'insider' research as the researcher becomes as one with the research setting/group and uses the knowledge bases of the setting, the people and the latter's explanations and language to describe the phenomenon being studied."
6768,它代表了一种“主观的”认识论，并且与整体一归纳范式（holistic - inductive)相关联。,This represents a 'subjective' epistemology and is associated with the holistic-inductive paradigm.
6769,目前，会议论文的体裁发生了变化，因为会议论文的目的已经超越其初衷，人们更加注重于提供书面文本。,"Now, however, conference papers are moving beyond the original purpose of the genre, and there is a heavier focus on providing a written text document."
6769,从全国的范围看，这种关键性的改变，其动力是政府对大学的资助，以及各种研究机构对不同的论文体裁的奖掖方式的变化。,"Nationally, the change in focus is being driven by government funding to universities and the awarding of varying research points for different research genres."
6769,一些研究机构更加鼓励提交完整的、经过双盲评审的会议论文，也很关注能否在会议论文集中发表。,"Greater points are earned for a conference paper that is a full paper and has been peer reviewed, as well as being published in conference proceedings."
6769,而一份很简短的摘要而且没有在会议论文集中发表的会议论文是不能获得经费资助的。,No points are earned for a conference paper that has been accepted based only on a short abstract and has not been published in conference proceedings.
6770,时间使得在一个年代里成本昂贵的建筑成为另一个年代里价格廉租的抢手货。时间可以帮助付清最初的成本，折旧(depreciation)费可以在建筑所应有的产出中体现出来。,"Time makes the high building costs of one generation the bargains of a following generation.Time pays off original capital costs, and this depreciation can be reflected in the yields required from a building."
6770,对某些企业来说，时间使得建筑的一些结构过时了，但对另一些企业来说则正好有用。,"Time makes certain structures obsolete for some enterprises, and they become available to others."
6771,问题非常清楚了，我是在不同层次上使用不同抽象概念来操作的。,"I was operating, it became plain, at a different level and with different kinds of abstraction."
6771,但是，运动、研究和那本书的动力都不是来自我。,"But the impetus for the campaign, the research, and the book did not come from me."
6771,它源自工厂战斗性工会传统的奇特力量。,It arose out of the extraordinary strength and power of a tradition of union militancy emanating from the plant.
6771,这种传统具有自己的国际主义理解和普遍真理的假设，尽管这也可能陷入这种情形：由于相当狭溢的托洛茨基式修辞，它面临着自己的困境并相当僵化，这种困难与我和哈特尔视角之间的更为根本的冲突差不多。,"This tradition had its own version of internationalism and presumptions to universal truth, although a case could be made that its capture and ossification by a rather narrow Trotskyist rhetoric was as much a part of the problem as the more fundamental conflict between Hayter's and my perspective."
6772,后殖民地研究对真实性（authenticity)这个概念提出了置疑。真实性观点认为，存在一种基础的、纯粹的、根本性的文化。,"Postcolonial studies therefore dispute the notion of authenticity --- the idea that there is some basic, pure, underlying culture."
6772,文化不可避免地会混合，而真实性这个错误的概念却刺激了（并将继续刺激）许多民族主义运动的产生。,Cultures are inevitably hybrid mixtures and yet the mistaken notion of authenticity is one that has fuelled (and continues to fuel) many nationalist movements.
6772,在另一个不同的领域，可以认为，对于反映了一些纯粹的、根本的、没有被西方社会重商主义所玷污的文化的“真实的”、“种族的”音乐的错误渴求，解释了所谓的“世界”音乐广为流行的原因。,"In a different realm, it can be suggested that the mistaken desire for‘authentic’, ‘ethnic’music reflecting some pure, underlying, culture, untainted by the commercialism of Western society, explains much of the popularity of so-called  ‘world’music."
6773,抽样基本上分为概率抽样和非概率抽样。,Sampling is primarily either non-probability or probability based.
6773,非概率抽样包括就近抽样、目标式抽样、滚雪球抽样和专家抽样。,"Non-probability sampling includes convenience, purposive, snowball sampling and expert sampling."
6773,概率抽样包括简单随机抽样（抽签方法、名称方法、出生日期或电脑方法）、系统抽样、分层抽样和多阶整群抽样。,"Probability sampling includes simple random sampling (lottery method, first name, date of birth or computer-generated methods), stratified sampling, cluster sampling and multi-stage sampling."
6774,使用集中趋势量数以及频数分布的图形描述，调査者能够陈述频数分布的本质。,"Using the measures of central tendency and graphical representation of frequency distributions, researchers can make statements about the nature of frequency distributions."
6774,既有正态分布也有偏态分布。,
6774,,Distributions can be normal or skewed.
6774,"在正态分布中，平均值、中位数及众数集中在同一点上,用一个钟形曲线表示[参见图9 - 8(a)]。","In normal distributions, the mean, median and mode are clustered around the same point and represent a bell-shaped curve (see figure 9.8(a))."
6775,误解是由下述假设产生的，即对“成功”的衡量要看预测与观察之间是否密切相关。,
6775,如同上文所阐释的那样，这样一种实验结果只不过导致另一种实验，直至一种证伪能够带来对基础理论的修正为止；因此，正是经验主义的失败带来成功理论的发展。,"As explained above, such an outcome of experimentation merely leads to another experiment, until a falsification can bring about modification of the underlying theory; it is therefore empirical failure that brings successful theoretical development."
6775,波珀主义者对实验成功含义的修正意味着对某种理论真实性的主张，在科学上（正如它在其他知识分支上那样）是一种更加微妙和复杂的过程。,"This Popperian revision of the meaning of experimental success implies that warranting the truth claims of a given theory is a much more subtle and complex process in the sciences, just as it is in other branches of knowledge."
6776,这并不是说，解放了的空间是不可能建构的，不可能在真实的或比喻的意义上把空间的社会建构用作革命政治战略的要素。,"This is not to say that liberated spaces are impossible to construct, that social constructions of spatiality cannot be used, in either a real or metaphorical sense, as strategic elements within revolutionary politics."
6776,需要特别强调的是，它也不意味着，“来自边缘的声音”不值得倾听，或与反资本主义统治的政治斗争无关。,"Nor, most emphatically, does it mean that ""voices from the margin"" are not worth listening to or irrelevant to political struggle against capitalist domination."
6776,事实上，如我将在下文试图表明的那样，政治战略的空间化(地理政治学)对于任何形式的解放政治学来说都是至关重要的。,"Indeed, as I shall later hope to show, a spatializing of political strategies (geopolitics) is crucial for any form of emancipatory politics."
6777,18世纪政治经济学的一个副作用是，把统治自然看作解放和自我实现的必要条件。,One side-effect of eighteenth century political economy was that the domination of nature was viewed as a necessary prerequisite to emancipation and self-realization.
6777,为了按照人的意图来控制自然，为了市场交换而开采自然，甚至根据人的设计来教化自然(并出售它的质量)，就需要复杂的自然知识。,"Sophisticated knowledge of nature was required in order to manipulate the natural world to human purposes, to exploit it for market exchange, even to humanize it (and sell its qualities) according to human design."
6777,但是，统治命题绝非故意包含对自然世界的破坏和掠夺。,But the thesis of domination never deliberately embraced the destruction and despoliation of the natural world.
6778,管制理论在初期发展阶段所关注的一个焦点，是民族国家之间不断变化的关系。,A key focus of regulation theory as it was originally developed is the changing relationships between national states.
6778,"因此，可以认为，福特主义体系是以第二次世界大战之后一段时期内美国对世界经济的支配为基础，正如其构建于布雷顿森林金融系统一样（莱森和思里夫特, 1997）。","Thus, it is argued that the Fordist system was based around the dominance of the United States over the world economy in the period immediately after the Second World War, as structured by the Bretton Woods financial system (Leyshon and Thrift, 1997)."
6778,该系统以美元为交换中介的基础建立起货币间的固定汇率。,"This system created fixed exchange rates between currencies, based around the US dollar as the medium of exchange."
6779,《纽伦堡法典》的两个最直接的贡献就是研究参与者的自愿参与和知情同意。,Two direct outcomes of the Nuremberg Code are voluntary participation and informed consent by research participants.
6779,“知情同意是研究中最基本的伦理准则。参与者应该完全了解研究的目的和本质，并且是在不受强制情况下同意参与”（Burns 1997，p.18)。,"' [Informed consent] is the most fundamental ethical principle that is involved [ in research]. Participants must understand the nature and purpose of the research and must consent to participate without coercion' (Burns 1997, p. 18)."
6780,描述频数分布的其他方法有折线图、直方图、地图绘制法以及人口锥形图。,"Other methods of representing frequency distributions are polygons, histograms, cartographs an population pyramids."
6780,折线图是由直线连接的点构成的，大多用于离散数据。,Polygons consist of dots joined by lines and are mostly used within terval data.
6780,直方图是由彼此挨着的垂直长方条构成的。,Histograms are graphs with vertical bars adjoining each other.
6780,连接这些长方条的中点，就能够制成频数的折线图。,These can be made into a frequency polygon by joining the mid points of the bars.
6781,气候植被顶极和演替概念暗含着植被达到这个容量取决于增长极限的假设。,The assumption that the vegetation reaches the capacity determined by the limits of growth is implicit in the climatic climax vegetation and the concept of succession.
6781,它形成了从气候方面解释植被覆盖的历史证据(例如在古生物学上)，以及重建全球气候变化造成过去植被变化的基础。,"It forms the basis of the interpretation of historical evidence of vegetation cover in climatic terms (for example, in palynology) and the reconstruction of past vegetation shifts resulting from global climate change."
6781,有时它还用以预测未来可能发生的气候变化。,Sometimes it is used to predict the potential of future climate changes.
6782,对于身份形成过程的一些重要观点都来源于个与文化密切相关的研究领域，这个领域就是后殖民地理论（postcokmial theory)。,Some of the most important insights into this process of identity formation have come from a field of study closely related to cultural studies: postcolonial theory.
6782,在讨论这个问题之前，我们需要区分一下殖民主义和帝国主义根据爱德华•赛德的论述，殖民主义（colonialism)可以被定义为一个国家通过强行在另一个国家建立新的定居地而对这个国家进行的直接统治。,Before discussing this work we need to make a distinction between colonialism and imperialism.Colonialism may be defined as the direct rule of one country by another through the imposition of new settlements.
6782,帝国主义（Imperialism)，与之相对应，可以被定义为对一个远离本国领土的控制中心的态度和行为。,"Imperialism, in contrast, is defined by the attitudes and actions of a domineering centre upon a distant territory."
6782,,Neocolonialism refers to the economic and political domination of previously colonized nations by Western powers after the ending of formal colonialism.
6783,地理学这门学科的定位意味着它和社会科学没有什么联系。,Where was geography when all this was going on?
6783,20世纪上半叶本学科在多数大学中设立的只有经济地理，但其理论方法和地理学家所关心的问题之间并没有多少联系。,What was its contribution to the war effort and to the burgeoning demand for social science expertise thereafter?
6783,新古典经济学寻求通过演绎模型的构建来说明市场操作:地理学家对经济活动的模式进行制图，并将其与自然环境联系起来。,"With regard to the former, geographers were involved in a range of intelligence-gathering and provision activities – much of it in the UK associated with mapping, air-photo interpretation, and the production of handbooks on countries where military operations were likely (Balchin, 1987; Clout, 2003)."
6784,致谢是指向在研究过程和报告编写过程中所有那些对研究者给予帮助的人表示感谢。,Acknowledgments are a polite way to extend a vote of thanks to all those who have assisted in the research process and reporting.
6784,特别是对参与研究的人员表示感谢。,"It is a courtesy to thank, in particular, those who participated in the study."
6784,但是，也需要顾及到那些曾经为研究做出贡献的人，即所有相识或不相识的数据收集人员、提供参考文献者和资金资助者、办事员和技术助理以及管理者和同行评议人员。,"However, you need to consider all those who contributed to your research: people who assisted in data collection, access to references and funding , clerical and technical assistance, and supervisors, as well as peer reviewers, known and unknown."
6785,在随机/概率抽样中，研究总体的每一个体被抽取作为研究对象的机会是相等的——即对象的选取具有偶然性，每一个体被随机地选取。,"In random/probability samples, each unit of the population being studied has an equal chance of being included in the sample — that is, the selection of units is determined by chance and each unit is therefore randomly selected."
6785,样本容量的确定基本上要看研究者想要得到的关于总体的一般性结论的置信度水平，也会受研究者的可用时间、经费和人力资源多少的影响。,"The decision regarding how many units to include in the study is primarily determined by the level of confidence the researcher wishes to achieve in regard to generalising their findings to the wider population.The decision can also be influenced by the amount of time, money and human resources the researcher has available."
6785,在随机抽样中，研究者可以使用多种表格来帮助决定样本容量。,There are various tables available to researchers to assist in decision making regarding sample size in probability samples.
6786,中位数是指位于分布中间的数值或者分布中间的那一点，这个点可以这样判断：一半的个案（cases）在它之下，一半在它之上。,The median is the middle score of a distribution or the point in a distribution that is identified as having half the cases below it and half above it.
6786,中位数可以用两种方法来判断： 按顺序排列原始数据或者是使用条形图。,The median can be determined in two ways: by organising the raw data into rank order or by using a bar graph.
6786,需要注意的是中位数与定序、定距或者是与定比测量层次有关，但是与定类测量层次没有关联。,"Remember that the median is associated with ordinal, interval or ratio levels of measurement but not nominal levels."
6787,通常人们把这个传统分为两个部分。,It is usual to divide this tradition into two subsets.
6787,一个是阿尔弗雷德•韦伯和他的追随者提出的，他们分析了一家厂商的定位决策，该厂商靠一个或多个供应商提供投入品，为一个或多个市场提供产品，涉及的相关区位不少于三个。,"First came Alfred Weber and his followers, who analyzed the location decision of a firm serving one or more markets and relying on one or more sources of supply, with the total number of such relevant points not less than three."
6787,另一个是“中心地方”理论，它分析了制造/市场营销等中心的定位和作用，这些中心服务于假设均匀分布的农业人口。,"Then came the tradition of central-place theory, which analyzed the location and roles of manufacturing/marketing/etc.centers serving a hypothetical evenly spread agricultural population."
6788,居中选址原则也解释了一些工业企业为什么位于中转点的原因。,The principle of median location also explains why some industrial firms locate at transshipment points.
6788,中转点是指这样一个地点，在这一地方一件货物的运输方式由一种转变为另一种。,A transshipment point is defined as a point at which a good is transferred from one transport mode to another.
6788,原先用卡乍或火车运送货物，在港口变为用轮船运输，在火车站，货物改由火车运输，而不再使用卡车。,"At a port, goods are transferred from trucks or trains to ships.At a railroad terminal, goods are transferred from trucks to the train."
6789,社会关系环节描述了人类卷入其中的各种社会性形式，以及由这种社会性引起的多少具有稳定性的社会关系秩序安排。,"The moment of social relations describes the various forms of sociality human beings engage in, and the more or less durable orderings of social relations to which this sociality may give rise."
6789,它聚焦于人类相互联系的方式——“社会联系的模式”——如他们过自己的生活、共同生产和交往等等。,"It focuses on the way human beings relate to each other — modes of social relating"" — as they live their lives, produce together, communicate, etc."
6789,协作结构，劳动分工和阶级、种族、年龄、性别等社会等级，或者能够进入物质和符号行动以及社会权力的具有细微差异的个人或集体，都是包含在这个环节中的问题。,"Cooperative structures, divisions of labor, social hierarchies of class, race, age, and gender, or differentiated individual or group access to material and symbolic activities and social power, are some of the issues encompassed within this moment."
6790,在资本循环的情形中(它自身是马克思研究的一个具有松散边界的领域)，问题是揭示生成和改造原理如何发挥作用、它的作用形式和范围。,"In the instance of capital circulation (itself a loosely bounded domain of Marxist enquiry) the problem is to explore the forms and domains of operation, the how of generative and transformative principles at work."
6790,这必然需要一种特殊的唯物主义研究策略。,This implies a particular materialist research strategy.
6790,例如，把民族国家视为同质性实体，而根据一套经济指标来检验其行为和作用，这只具有有限的价值。,"Treating nation states, for example, as homogeneous entities and examining their behaviour and performance according to a set of economic indicators is of limited value."
6791,沃勒斯坦确定了事件发生直接场所的地缘政治空间作为空间的对等物，由此创造了短期地缘政治时空(episodic-geopolitical TimeSpace)。,"Wallerstein identifies geopolitical space, the immediate locales of events, as the spatial equivalent thus creating episodic-geopolitical TimeSpace."
6791,布劳德尔的第二个跨度是一种更一般的摹制时间(patterned time)（趋势和周期），沃勒斯坦把意识形态空间——例如冷战时期把世界划分为东方/西方这样不同的场所——加入其中。,"Braudel’s second span is a more general patterned time (trends and cycles) to which Wallerstein adds an ideological space, locales of different divisions of the world, such as East/West during the Cold War."
6791,这就产生了一个周期性的意识形态时空(cyclical-ideological TimeSpace)。,This produces a cyclical-ideological TimeSpace.
6792,主持会议的方法：作为会议发言者、会议出席者，你很可能被要求主持某个分组会议。,"Tips for conference chairs: As well as presenting a conference paper, as a conference participant, you may be asked to chair a conference session."
6792,"“会议的成功更多地依赖于各个分组会议的主持水平。如果这项任务交给你，你就有责任做好。这项工作包括三类任务——对组织者的责任、对发言人的责任及对受众的责任（Newbie & Cannon 1989, p.35)。","'Much of the success of a conference will depend on the quality of the chairing of individualsessions. Should this task fall to you, there are many responsibilities tofulfil . There are three categories of the task — responsibilities to theorganizers, to the speaker, and to the audience' (Newble & Cannon,1989, p. 35)"
6793,专家抽样仅仅包括那些被研究者定义为“专家”的人。,Expert sampling only involves people who the researcher identifies as 'experts'.
6793,这些人凭借其特有专业知识发表深刻的意见或评论。,These people have specialist knowledge with which to make informed opinions or comments.
6793,这样的抽样在焦点群体法或德尔菲法中使用（这些类型的方法将在第六章详细讨论）。,Such samples are used in focus groups and Delphic sessions (these types of methods are discussed in detail in chapter 6).
6794,转换表与数据卡的使用相关（Babbie 1995)。,Transfer sheets are linked to the use of data cards (Babbie 1995).
6794,通过在同样型号的卡片中使用打孔系统，数据卡能使研究人员确定数据集的模式。,Data cards use a system of hole-punching in same-sized cards to enable the researcher to determine patterns in data sets.
6794,该模式是这样确定的:将一根杆（或一系列杆）穿过数据卡集以确定哪些卡片符合由那个孔（一个变量）或那些孔（多变量）所确定的可以供研究之用的模式。,The patterns are determined by pushing a rod (or series of rods) through the data card sets in order to determine which cards fit the pattern determined by the hole (a variable) or holes (variables) selected for examination by the researcher.
6795,资本的地理生产了一种模糊联系的景观。,The geography of capital produced a landscape of obscured connections.
6795,城市市场越集中，它的腹地越开阔，就越容易忘记买卖之物的最终起源。,"The more concentrated the city markets became and the more extensive its hinterland, the easier it was to forget the ultimate origins of the things it bought and sold."
6795,（Cronon，1991：340）,"(Cronon, 1991: 340)."
6796,为什么会产生这种运动？,Why this movement?
6796,因为已经在其他地方详细地探讨了其根源（Harvey，1982，1989a），在此我只是概述主要论点。,"Since I have explored its roots in greater detail elsewhere (Harvey, 1982, 1989a) I simply summarize the principal argument."
6796,时间是资本主义条件下的重要量度，因为社会劳动是价值的尺度，剩余社会劳动时间是利润的源泉。,Tune is a vital magnitude under capitalism because social labor is the measure of value and surplus social labor time lies at the origin of profit.
6796,此外，资本周转时间也很重要，因为（生产、流通和资本周转的）加速是单个资本家追逐利润最强有力的竞争手段。,"Furthermore, the turnover time of capital is significant because speed-up (in production, in marketing, in capital turnover) is a powerful competitive means for individual capitalists to augment profits."
6797,这种“右翼乌托邦理想”与政治权力和实践之间的联系具有重要的意义。,"The connection between this ""right-wing Utopianism and political power and practice is significant."
6797,即使它完全不是占统治地位的观点（甚至在右派内部），它亦是一种对抗反资本主义阵营的有力的亲资本主义武器。那些反资本主义阵营，以平等、正义、道德或仅仅是通俗易懂的政治经济和生态常识的名义，试图抑制、管制或取消所有明显的暴行，有充分理由说，资本主义在这些暴行上是臭名昭著的。,"Even if it is a far from dominant argument (even within the right) it is a potent pro-capitalist weapon with which to go to work against a whole array of forces that would, in the name of equality, justice, morality, or just plain political-economic and ecological common sense, seek to curb, regulate, and diminish all the manifest excesses for which capitalism is justy infamous."
6798,私有化是公共部门重构的另一个重要形式。,Privatizationis another important form of public sector restructuring.
6798,如表13—1所列，这是一系列复杂的过程。,"This involves a complex set of processes, as revealed by Table 13."
6798,"私有化最明显的形式是资产变卖（asset sales),即将公共部门资产卖给私人部门。","1. The most obvious form of privatization is asset sales, when public sector assets are sold to the private sector."
6799,研究者能够获得两种类型的资料：原始资料和二手资料。,Researchers are able to access two types of data sources: primary and secondary.
6799,原始资料是指那些为了他们研究项目的使用目的而由研究者第一手收集的资料。,Primary data sources are those that are collected first-hand by the researcher for use in their research project.
6799,原始资料来源包括诸如问卷调査、访谈文本和观察。,"Primary data include, for example, responses to questionnaires, interview texts and observations."
6799,二手资料是指那些因其他人的初始使用目的而产生但后来被与初始项目不相关的另外的研究者使用的资料。,Secondary data sources are those that have been produced by someone else for primary usage and are then used by another researcher not connected with the first project.
6799,二手资料来源包括诸如统计记录、政府文件、日记和信件以及其他研究者取得的研究成果。,"Secondary data include, for example, statistical records, government documents, diaries and letters, and research data conducted by other researchers."
6800,"例如，研究者可能论证以下命题：在淡季,飞往省会城市的机票价格下降可能会提高该城市的游览率。","For example, a researcher may consider the following statement: the lowering of airfares to capital cities in the low season will increase visitation rates to those cities."
6800,在这一命题中，研究者假设了前往省会城市的机票价格和游览率之间存在关联。,"In this statement, the researcher has hypothesised a relationship between the cost of airfares and visitation rates to capital cities."
6800,这是一个描述两个变量之间因果关系的假说，两个变量中一个是自变量：机票价格降低，另一个是因变量游览率的上升。,"The statement is a hypothesis describing a causal relationship between two variables, an independent variable, the lowering of airfares (the cause variable), and the dependent variable, the increase in visitation rates (the effect variable)."
6801,"但没有证据显示其中任何一项工作综合了人文地理学和自然地理学两方面(Johnston, 1983d)。","But there is no evidence that either body of work integrates human and physical geography (Johnston, 1983d)."
6801,实际上，综合派学者的呼吁似乎是基于不同的语义。,
6801,,"Indeed, the claims of the integrationists appear to be based on differences in semantics."
6801,地理这个词具有两个主要含义：一个是口语化的，指的是环境；而另一个是学术性的，指的是对环境的研究。,"The word geography has two major definitions: one is vernacular, and refers to the environment; the other is academic, and refers to the study of  the environment."
6802,坚持认为热力学第二定律和生态动力学法则是所有人类社会存在的必要条件，这是一回事，不过，把这些定律或法则看作是理解人类历史的充分条件，则是完全不同的另一回事了。,"It is one thing to argue that the second law of thermodynamics and the laws of ecological dynamics are necessary conditions within which all human societies have their being, but quite another to treat them as sufficient conditions for the understanding of human history."
6802,后一种观点暗示，整个人类历史是一种违反自然法的不可持续的运动。,To propose the latter would imply that the whole of human history is an exercise in unsustainability in violation of natural law.
6802,这是一种大而空的主张。,This is so grand an assertion as to be pointless.
6803,在对环境进行研究时，地方的描述是不可或缺的。然后对这种描述进行比较，得出地方的分类系统，结果可以进一步在通用模型的背景下对地方进行评价。,"The description of places was essential as environments were explored; such descriptions were then compared, leading to systems of categorization of places, so that places could subsequently be evaluated against the background of general models."
6803,现在自然地理学将自己的研究领域扩展到环境管理，地方应该得到自然地理学家更多的重视，因为这关系到自然环境的可持续管理，城市地区就是一个例证。,"As physical geography now extends to environmental management, place warrants greater explicit attention by physical geographers in relation to the management of sustainable physical environments as exemplified by urban places."
6804,不过真实世界不是一个同质的平原。,Now it is true that the real world isn't a homogeneous plain.
6804,我童年时在地图上看到的那些麦穗和采矿车也说明了同样的道理。,Those sheaves of wheat and little mining carts on my childhood maps tell us as much.
6804,然而，很少有人会认为自然资源能解释大部分经济活动在空间的不均匀分布——究竟什么资源可以解释为什么在大洛杉矶居住着1100万人，而圣保罗却1700万人呢？,"Yet few would argue that natural resources explain more than a fraction of the observed unevenness of economic activity across spacewhat exactly is the resource that explains why 11 million people are in Greater Los Angeles, or 17 million in São Paulo?"
6805,因此，作为社会事务认识之源的“自我”和“他人”之间的关系总是时空性构造。,"The relations between ""self"" and ""other"" from which a certain kind of cognition of social affairs emanates is always, therefore, a spatio-temporal construction."
6805,对于理解(个人的和政治的)同一性的形成，这是一个至关重要的问题。,This is a crucial issue for understanding how identities (personal and political) get formed.
6805,时空框架中的变迁影响自我-他人的关系(例如，要么完全消灭自我-他人的区别，要么重新定义在赋予自我以价值的过程中谁是或不是重要的他者)。,"Changes in spatiotemporal frame affect self–other relations (by, for example, either dissolving the self–other distinction entirely or redefining who are or are not significant others in assigning value to the self)."
6806,中途拦截式调査既可使用自填式问卷也可使用调査者完成问卷。,Intercept surveys use either interviewer completed questionnaires or self-completion questionnaires.
6806,上门调査发生在受访者的住所。,Household surveys occur at the residence of the respondent.
6806,综合性调査通过上门调査的方式实施，既可通过电话方式也可使用面对面方式进行。,Omnibus surveys are conducted through household surveys either using face-to-face surveys or telephone surveys.
6807,"显著性检验能够使研究者从统计上判定在样本中变量间的关系是否是偶然的，从而决定是否将这种关系推论至总体（Neman 2000, p. 338; Babbie 1995, PP. 431 ~436)。","Tests of significance enable the researcher to determine statistically whether a relationship between variables is a chance one in the sample as opposed to being probable in the population (Neuman 2000, p. 338; Babbie 1995, pp. 431-6)."
6807,萨兰塔克斯（1998）在表9-7中涉及了非参数检验和参数检验。,Sarantakos (1998) refers to non-parametric and parametric tests in table 9.
6807,参数检验假定所研究的变量在总体中表现为正态分布。,7. Parametric tests assume that the variable being studied reflects a normal distribution in the population.
6807,非参数检验假定所研究的变量在总体中并不表现为正态分布。,Non-parametric tests assume that the variable being studied does not reflect a normal distribution in the population.
6808,它们的存在是因为它们没有被住宅划分列入在内，否则的话早就算是违反了划分的规则。,"These are generally present by exemption from existing residential zoning, or are in violation of the zoning."
6808,每个人都喜欢这些小场所的存在，对于这个问题没有任何争议。,"Everybody likes their presence, and no arguments arise over their desirability."
6808,如果说有争议的话，则是集中于这样一个问题，即什么类别的场所在新的划分方案中最不可能会与实际生活的需要产生冲突，因为包括在这个方案中的每一类场所都会产生不可克服的问题。,"The arguments, rather, revolve around the question of what kind of categories in the new zoning will be least at odds with the needs of real life.The drawbacks of each offered category areformidable."
6809,阿尔贝蒂的设计不应理解为早已作为私人之物存在的性欲的私密化。,Alberti's design should not be understood as the privatization of a preexisting sexuality as that-which-is-private.
6809,被私密化的身体是在最近被性别化的。,The body that is privatized is newly sexualized.
6809,实际上，它就是一个新的身体。,"Indeed, it is a new body."
6809,新的性别正是在它被私密化的那一刻才产生的。,The new sexuality is produced at the very moment of its privatization.
6809,定义和建造房子的全部战略机制都参与了这种性别本身的生产。,All of the ensemble of strategic mechanisms that define and constitute the house are involved in the production of this sexuality as such.
6809,（Wigley，1992：346),(p. 346)
6810,乔利(Chorley，1978)对比了地貌研究中实用主义和现实主义方法的差别。,Chorley (1978) has drawn the distinction between functional and realist approaches in geomorphology.
6810,实用主义理论就是进行统计归纳，而关注过程动力学就意味着要作更为现实的理解。,Functional theories involve statistical generalizations whereas a focus on process dynamics implies greater realism of understanding.
6810,这样就出现两个问题:小尺度的研究结果—不论是实用主义的还是现实主义的—能不能应用到更大的尺度上？,"Two questions arise: can the results of small-scale studies, whether functional or realist, be applied to the larger scale?"
6810,地方研究在何种程度上能够代表更大的区域范围，还是只能作为一个独特案例研究？,And to what extent are local studies representative of the wider region or merely unique case studies?
6811,一个案例研究使用定量方法还是定性方法取决于表现方法论的范式以及这些占统治地位范式的内在本体论、认识论、方法论的视角的显著特征。,"The distinguishing feature that determines whether a case study is quantitative or qualitative is founded in the paradigm that informs the methodology and the inherent ontological, epistemological and methodological perspectives of those governing paradigms."
6811,此外，研究者还可以选择混合方法。,"Furthermore, a researcher may choose to mix methods."
6811,方法论和方法的选择与研究项目的目的、对象、假设有着直接联系。,"The choice of methodology and methods is directly linked to the aims, objectives and hypotheses of the research project."
6812,为了对排斥性问题做出反应，许多城市提出了包含性分区制（inclusicionary zoning）政策。,"In response to the exclusion problem, many cities have developed inclusionary zoning policies."
6812,按照包含性房屋计划，地方政府迫使开发商为低收人家庭修建住宅。,"Under an inclusionary housing program, the local government forces local developers to build dwellings for low income households."
6812,这些住宅一般以低于建造成本的价格销售给低收入家庭。,
6813,他在家具行里工作了两年，接着到一家保险公司的地方办公室上班，后来又接手经营一所学校里的自助餐厅。,"He worked in the furniture store for two years, then in an insurance company’s branch office.Then he took a job managing a school cafeteria."
6813,他的太太原本从事秘书工作，后来转而担任会计。,"His wife worked as a secretary, then as an accountant."
6813,科莫这一代的土耳其人不论背景多么传统，都已认识到夫妻两人都必须工作。,"No matter how traditional their background, Turks of Kemal’s generation have learned that husband and wife both must work."
6814,定量内容分析包括确定与研究者所选择研究变量相关的频数、指向、强度和空间。,"Quantitative content analysis involves determining the frequency, direction, intensity and space associated with the variable(s) the researcher has selected for study."
6814,根据这四个方面来收集和分析资料，然后编纂报告。,"Data are gathered and analysed in regard to these four aspects, and then a report is compiled."
6814,定性内容分析包括寻找资料、根据资料进行分类、评估分类的相关性和强度、报告调查结果。,"Qualitative content analysis involves locating the data, developing categories arising from the data, assessing the relevance and strength of the categories and reporting the findings."
6815,在一些报告中要求给出报告摘要(executive summary)。,"In some reports, an executive summary may be required."
6815,报告摘要的长度可视报告篇幅而定。,Executive summaries can vary in length depending on the length of the overall report.
6815,"例如20页的报告通常有1页或2页的报告摘要，50页的报告可以有3~4页，100 页报告有5页或6页(Ticehurst & Veal 1999, p.237)。","For example, 20-page reports usually have an executive summary of one or two pages, 50-page reports three or four pages and 100-page reports five or six pages (Ticehurst & Veal 1999, p. 237)."
6815,超过100页的报告可以总结出大约6页报告摘要——任何超过6页的摘要都可以视为一篇关于报告本身的短文。,Reports longer than 100 pages have an executive summary of approximately six pages ——anything over six pages is moving into a short article on the report itself.
6816,事实上，备忘录对研究人员的辅助贯穿研究的全过程。,"Essentially, memos serve to assist the researcher throughout the analysis phase."
6816,备忘录可以记录为了确定新的研究方向或数据收集、分析方向所作的观察、思考或评论。,"Memos can record an observation, a reflection or a comment to pursue a new direction of questioning or data collection/analysis."
6816,备忘录也可以用来记录“意外”的发现——在野外工作或分析工作中不期而至的发现或偶得的概念。,Memos can also record a 'eureka' discovery — an unexpected finding or concept arising during field and analytical work.
6816,例如，下面是引自詹宁斯（1999）在一项研究工程中记录在练习簿上的备忘录。,"For example, the following memo was noted in an exercise book from a research project conducted by Jennings (1999)."
6817,一类错误和二类错误是与陈述假设的研究项目相关的。,Type I and Type II errors are associated with research projects that state hypotheses.
6817,在研究项目的分析阶段，通过数据收集汇总，研究者能够进行假设检验。,"In the analytical phase of a research project, having aggregated the data, the researcher is able to test hypotheses."
6817,研究者使用的假设有许多的类型，主要包括零假设和备择假设。,"There are several types of hypotheses that the researcher uses, primarily the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis."
6818,然而，公社的排他政治是很强大的。,"The exclusionary politics of the commune were, however, very strong."
6818,在内部，它被表现并想象成精神和物质衰败的海洋中一个具有德行和真实的岛屿。,Internally it was represented and imagined as an island of virtue and authenticity in a sea of spiritual and material decay.
6818,外人看它是嵌人美国乡村中心的一个致癌异物。,Outsiders saw it as a cancerous foreign body inserted into the heart of rural United States.
6819,在今天，人们常常自觉地且有意识地努力唤起一种地方感和往昔感。,The effort to evoke a sense of place and of the past is now often deliberate and conscious.
6819,但这里面包含着一种危险。,But herein lies a danger.
6819,对本真性的追逐创造了一些传统和一种商业化的遗产文化。,"The quest for authenticity, invented traditions and a commercialized heritage culture."
6819,麦康纳指出，现代性的最终胜利并非是非现代世界的消失，而是它的人为保存和重构(MacCannell，1976:8)。,"The final victory of modernity, MacCannell (1976: 8) suggests, is not the disappearance of the non-modern world but its artificial preservation and reconstruction."
6820,边际威慑原则可以用一个简单的例子来说明。,The principle of marginal deterrence can be explained with a simple example.
6820,假定一个国家对盗窃规定的刑期为1年，而武装抢劫的刑期是2年。,Suppose that a state initially has a one-year penalty for burglary and a two-year penalty for armed robbery.
6820,对抢劫的处罚较重是由于抢劫的社会成本较大：抢劫的受害者通常会造成伤亡，而盗窃的受害者只是财产的损失。,"Robbery carries a greater penalty because robbery has a higher social cost: the victims of robbery are often injured or killed, while the victims of burglary simply lose their property."
6821,“永恒性”作为一种“广泛联系”的体系源自过程。,"A ""permanence"" arises as a system of ""extensive connection"" out of processes."
6821,实体在它们的边界内以及它们创造空间之过程的内在秩序安排中获得相对稳定性，这是暂时的。,"Entities achieve relative stability in their bounding and their internal ordering of processes creating space, for a time."
6821,这些永恒以排他的方式最终占据一块空间（暂时的），并因此定义一个位置——它们的位置(暂时的）。,Such permanences come to occupy a piece of a space in an exclusive way (for a time) and thereby define a place — their place — (for a time).
6822,因此，后现代文化的分裂和变化在城市景观的物质结构中表现得十分明显。,The fragmentation and diversity of post-modern culture is therefore manifest in the physical structure of the landscape.
6822,星云型大都市（galactic metropolis)这个词就是用于描述这样的城市。,The term galactic metropolis has also been coined to describe such cities.
6822,用这个词来标志这些城市的原因在于，城市的商业中心看起来像一个广阔星系中散布的星星，而不是一个可识别的中心。,The reason for this label is that the commercial centres in such cities look more like stars spread about a wider galaxy rather than a single recognizable centre.
6822,将城市最极端地描述成一种元素的分散随机表现，这就是迪尔和弗卢斯特的富有想像力的概念—— 基诺资本主义（keno capitalism)。,The most extreme portrayal of the city as a decentralized random expression of elements is Dear and Flusty’s (1998) highly imaginative notion of keno capitalism.
6822,在这个模型中，城市结构在边缘城市、消费、展示、防护社区及全球需求中心等要素之间以一种随机的方式而变化(这更像基诺游戏中的选牌）。,"In this model the city structure varies between elements of edge cities, consumption, spectacle, gated communities and global command centres in a random manner (rather like the selection of cards in the game of keno)"
6823,在对原始数据进行编码之前，研究者需要确保正确地搭配编码以及保证其有效。,"Before coding all the raw data, the researcher needs to ensure that thecodes have been correctly assigned and that they work."
6823,正如研究者需要对问卷进行前测，或对调查问卷或其他数据收集工具进行前测一样，研究者也必须对编码簿进行检査核对。,"Just as theresearcher has to engage in pre-testing or running a pilot of theirquestionnaire or other data collection tool, so too do they have toundertake a check of the code book."
6823,检査要从调查问卷(或其他的数据收集工具）中提取样本，然后使用编码簿中的编码输入答案。,"This check is achieved by taking asample of the questionnaires (or other data collection tool), thenentering the responses using the codes in the code book."
6823,在检查过程中，研究者要保证赋予答案选项的编码没有不规则的编码，同时还要确保为其他类型开放式问题赋予适当的编码。,"During thischeck, the researcher should ensure that there are no anomalies in thecodes assigned to response sets, as well as ensuring that appropriatecodes have been ascribed to any 'other' categories and open-endedquestions."
6824,在这一命题中，研究者假设了前往省会城市的航空费用和游览率之间存在相关关系。,"In this statement, the researcher has hypothesised a relationship between the cost of airfares and visitation rates to capital cities."
6824,这是一个描述两个变量之间因果关系的假说，两个变量中一个是自变量：航空费用降低；另一个是因变量：游览率的上升。,"The statement is a hypothesis describing a causal relationship between two variables, an independent variable, the lowering of airfares (the cause variable), and the dependent variable, the increase in visitation rates (the effect variable)."
6824,研究者将设计收集和分析资料的工具，从而支持或推翻该假设，并因此支持或推翻两个变量之间的因果关系。,The researcher would design data collection and analysis tools to either support or reject the hypothesis and thereby support or reject the proposed causal relationship between the two variables.
6825,同时，人类自身又逐渐适应了自然环境和周围的人。,Yet at the same time people themselves gradually accommodate both to their physical environment and to the people around them.
6825,因此，存在着一个连续的双向过程，一种社会空间辩证法（sociospatial dialectic)，即人们在创造和改变城市空间的同时又被他们所居住和工作的空间以各种方式控制着。,"There is thus a continuous two-way process, a sociospatial dialectic, in which people create and modify urban spaces while at the same time being conditioned invarious ways by the spaces in which they live and work."
6825,邻里和社区被创造、维系和改造；同时，居民的价值、态変和行为也不可避免地被其周围的环境以及周围的人的价值、态度和行为所影响。,"Neighbourhoods and communities are created, maintained and modified; the values, attitudes and behaviour of their inhabitants, meanwhile, cannot help but be influenced by their surroundings and by the values, attitudes and behaviour of the people around them."
6826,初稿应该用A4型号或美国规格的纸张来打印，正文采用两倍间距，使用 Times，Times Roman，American Typewriter，Courier的字体，字号用12镑。,"Manuscripts should be prepared on A4 or US letter-sized paper, and text should be double-spaced using Times, Times Roman, American Typewriter or Courier in 12 point size."
6826,初稿采用2.5厘米的页边距，除非投稿指南或说明中有明确规定时，此格式有待商榷外，一般不采用其他格式。,
6826,,"The manuscript should have 2.5 cm margins on all sides, the type should be left justified and no format characters should be used unless specified in directions or instructions to contributors."
6826,初稿的内容应该依照以下的顺序排列:封页、摘要、正文、参考文献、附录、脚注、表格和图解。,"Text should be organised in the following order: title page, abstract, text, references, appendices, footnotes, tables and figures."
6827,标准差比极差和百分位点需要更高的算术技能（Neuman 2000）。,Standard deviation involves a higher level of arithmetic skill than the calculation of range and percentiles (Neuman 2000).
6827,虽然它的计算更加复杂，但仍是最常用的变异量数。,"Although it is more involved in its calculation, it is the most used measure of variation."
6827,标准差适用于定距和定比测量层次，且使用平均值。,Standard deviation requires measurement at the level of interval and ratio and uses the mean.
6827,从本质上来讲，标准差求出了所有数据和平均值之间的差异。,"Essentially, the standard deviation identifies the difference between all scores and the mean."
6828,《来自波多黎各》一书描述了纽约一个贫穷、肮脏区域中的波多黎各人的生活。此书的作者，人类学家埃琳娜•帕迪利亚讲述了人们互相间了解多少的情况——谁是可以信赖的，谁不是，谁蔑视法律，谁坚守法律，谁能力很强而且信息量大，谁很笨拙又无知——以及这些情况是怎样从人行道上的公共生活中和相关的店铺中得知的。,"Anthropologist Elena Padilla, author of Up from Puerto Rico, describing Puerto Rican life in a poor and squalid district of New York, tells how much people know about each other --- who is to be trusted and who not, who is defiant of the law and who upholds it, who is competent and well informed and who is inept and ignorant --- and how these things are known from the public life of the sidewalk and its associated enterprises."
6828,这些情况带有公共特性。,These are matters of public character.
6829,还有一个问题，就是因为这种方法表面上具有科学与管理的基础，加上硬性指标的附加条件，因而造成一种虚假的安全感。,A further problem is that this approach engenders a false sense of security because of its apparent basis in science and engineering and the attachment to hard targets.
6829,冈德森和霍林在对理解人文与自然系统转变问题的流畅而清新的评价中抨击了环境系统控制概念的简单处方：“它们似乎用意识形态上似是而非的确定性、精密的数字或行动取代固有的不确定性。,"In an easily read and refreshingly honest appraisal of the problems of understanding transformations in human and natural systems, Gunderson and Holling  attack the simple prescriptions of the concept of environmental systems control because ‘[t]hey seem to replace inherent uncertainty with the spurious certainty of ideology, precise numbers or action. The theories implicit in these examples ignore multiple stable states.’ They note the problem imposed by non-linearities of the types described above."
6829,”他们注意到了上述非线性现象所提出的问题，进而指出，“这些理论忽视了起关键性支配过程的缓慢侵蚀能够突然把一个生态系统或一种经济转变为或许根本不可逆的另一种状态。”,They go on to say that: ‘The theories ignore the possibility that the slow erosion (meaning change) of key controlling processes can abruptly flip an ecosystem or economy into a different state that might be effectively irreversible.’
6830,"部分和整体的相互交叉状态必然导致“主体与客体以及原因与结果之间的互换性”(Levins and Lewontin, 1985:274)。","The interdigitation of parts and wholes entails ""the interchangeability of subject and object, of cause and effect"" (Levins and Lewontin, 1985: 274)."
6830,例如，我们必须把个体理解成社会变迁过程的主体和客体，同样必须把有机体看作既是进化的主体又是进化的客体。,"Organisms, for example, have to be looked at as both the subjects and the objects of evolution in exactly the same way that individuals have to be considered as both subjects and objects of processes of social change."
6830,原因和结果的可逆性使特定模式(即使用反馈循环来描述)不再适用。,The reversibility of cause and effect renders causally specified models (even when endowed with feedback loops) inappropriate.
6830,正由于它在持续过程之流中的嵌入性以及流的再现，辩证法有限地诉诸因果观点，并因此将之视为一种特殊的有限情形。,"Precisely by virtue of its embeddedness in and representation of the flow of continuous processes, dialectics makes limited appeal to cause and effect argument and then only as a particular limiting case."
6831,在新英格兰，殖民者拥有的是笛卡儿式固定财产权利观和抽象空间边界观，他们“创造了霸道的地名，这些名称或者使人想起他们家乡，或者直接就是它的所有者的名字”。,"In New England, the colonists had a Cartesian vision of fixed property rights, of boundaries in abstract space, and they ""created arbitrary place-names which either recalled localities in their homeland or gave a place the name of its owner."""
6831,对于印第安人来说，英国人的时空体系及其产生的地名在根本上是无用的，而对于英国人来说，印第安人的地名同样如此。,To the Indians the English spatio-temporal system and the placenames it generated were essentially useless and to the English the Indian placenames were equally so.
6831,"两种社会的和生态的体系之间的冲突是围绕命名的冲突，也是围绕在价值定义中运用的相关时间和空间概念的冲突(参阅Mignolo, 1994)。","The dash between these two social and ecological systems was a dash over naming as well as over the relevant conceptions of space and time to be deployed in the definition of value (see also Mignolo, 1994)."
6832,在泰勃特社会里，住宅消费的增加并不影响财产税。,"In the Tiebout world, an increase in housing consumption does not affect property taxes."
6832,假设有几个富有、高支出的家庭决定购买价值20万美元的旁产，他们将形成一个新的高支出群体。,"Suppose that a few of the wealthy, high-spending households decide to buy $200,000 homes."
6832,该群体拥有价值20万美元的房产，同时以1%的财产税资助2000美元的公园计划。,"They will form a new community of high-spending households with $200,000 houses, and finance their $2,000 park program with a 1 percent property tax."
6833,开始收集相关文献和文件时，应该建立一个文献目录索引、目录卡片或文献图书系统。,"As you commence gathering relevant literature and documents, you should start a bibliographic index, or a bibliographic card/book system."
6833,这个系统可以通过手写或使用诸如Endnotes的软件程序来建立。,The system can be created manually by handwritten methods or by using software programs such as Endnotes.
6833,这些程序非常有用，可以将文献目录程序与文字处理程序整合起来。,"Such programs are very useful, as you can integrate and merge text between the bibliographic program and your word processing program."
6834,简言之，正是金钱力量的普遍性和社会性允许各种他性独立地生存或存在下去。,"It is, in short, precisely the universality and sociality of money power that allows all kinds of othernesses to take on an independent existence and to survive."
6834,那本身并没有什么特别的不对(如果我们有那种办法，为什么不像詹克斯或利奥塔建议的那样做一个折衷派呢)。,There is nothing in itself particularly wrong with that (if we have the resources why not be as eclectic as Jencks or Lyotard suggest we should).
6834,但是，它确实迫使我们考虑当代世界中差异和他性的生产与政治经济权力的组织和分配之间的关系。,But it does force us to consider the relation between the production of difference and otherness in the contemporary world and the organization and distribution of political-economic power.
6835,少数种族聚居的市郊遭受重击，不仅有些经济状况较佳的拉丁裔人口丧失了房子，最穷的新进移民也因为高度仰赖建筑及房地产产业谋生，而突然失去了就业的主要来源。,"The ethnic suburbs were hit hard.Not only did some better-off Latinos lose their houses but the poorer new arrivals, who were often dependent on the building and property-maintenance industries for their livelihoods, found themselves without their main source of employment."
6835,不过，经济衰退对于落脚城市的基本运作逻辑并没有影响。,"The downturn, however, did not affect the basic logic of the arrival city."
6835,在2008年底至2009年之间，拉丁美洲移民虽然大幅减少了寄回家乡的钱财数目，但没有人迁返家乡。,"Latin American migrants sharply reduced their flow of remittances to villages in late 2008 and in 2009, but there was no return migration."
6836,和这些差异性在一起的，也存在着足够多的相似性，使我们能够鉴别日常生活中普遍存在的现代性，在当前高消费世界中有其本身达到高潮的发展轨迹。,Alongside the differences there are enough similarities for us to identify a generic ordinary modernity of everyday life that has its own trajectory of development culminating in contemporary mass consumption.
6836,当前现代世界的社会变化是作为社会时间的周期与趋势的复杂的混合物。,Social change in our modern world is a complex mix of cycles and trends as social times.
6836,无论如何，这终究可能是一些对我们前途至关重要的趋势。,"Ultimately, however, it may be that it is the trends that are all-important to our futures."
6837,作为现代人，在规划短期、中期和长远未来的时候，我们通过许多个别项目或一组项目来安排我们的生活。,"As modern people, we live our lives through many individual and group projects as we plan our short-, medium- and long-term futures."
6837,现代机构通过各种规划手段来运行。,Modern institutions operate through various planning instruments.
6837,例如，在20世纪某些时段，下述所有“大规划”活动至少在一 个时期内取得了成功：城市规划、企业规划、冷战时期军事工业联合体的军事规划、福利国家的凯恩斯经济规划、第三世界国家发展规划和共产主义国家的五年计划等。,"For instance, during parts of the twentieth century all of the following ‘grand planning’ activities prospered for at least a period: the urban planning of cities, the corporate planning of firms, the military planning of the Cold War military–industrial complexes, the Keynsian  economic planning of welfare states, the development planning of third world states, and the five-year industrial planning of communist states."
6838,此书是对当下城市规划（city planning）和重建理论的抨击。,This book is an attack on current city planning and rebuilding.
6838,同时，更主要的也是尝试引介一些城市规划和重建的新原则，这些原则与现在被教授的那些东西——从建筑和规划的流派到周末增刊以及女性杂志——不同，甚至相反。,"It is also, and mostly, an attempt to introduce new principles of cityplanning and rebuilding, different and even opposite from those now taught in everything from schools of architecture and planning to the Sunday supplements and women's magzines."
6838,我所进行的抨击不是对重建改造方法的一些不痛不痒的批评，或对城市设计形式的吹毛求疵。,My attack is not based on quibbles about rebuilding methods or hairsplitting ahout fashions in design.
6838,,"It is an attack, rather, on the principles and aims that have shaped modern, orthodox city planning and rebuilding."
6839,毕竟，城市化的漫长历史只是最近世界历史中发生的全部环境变迁过程的最重大方面之一。,"The long history of urbanization is, after all, one of the most significant of all the processes of environmental modification that have occurred throughout recent world history."
6839,在19世纪，那一过程就显现出爆炸性发展，创造了一系列前所未闻的全球生态条件。,"In the last century that process has become explosive, creating a set of global ecological conditions that have never been seen before."
6839,环境问题也浮出水面，这是我们城市化行动所创造的生态关系所特有的。,And environmental issues have emerged that are wholly specific to the ecologies our urbanizing activities have created.
6840,图1-1表示的是大城市地区可能的最简单形式。,Figure 1-1 shows the simplest possible arrangement of a metropolitan area.
6840,大城市地区包含城市化地区的县区。,The MA is the county containing the urbanized area.
6840,这个简单的例子使我们看到关于大城市地区的一个问题。,This simple case shows one of the problems with the MA concept.
6841,那么，做一个总结，城市经济学文献提供了清晰和明确的分析，但是没有把城市间的空间关系模型化。,"In summary, then, the urban economics literature offers clear and explicit analysis, but does not model the spatial relationship of cities to each other."
6841,地理学传统虽然很有见地，但缺乏微观经济学基础，所以也没有我们希望的从理论分析中得出的犀利洞察力。,"The geographical tradition, while rich in insight, lacks a microeconomic foundation and as a result lacks the sharp edges we want from a theoretical analysis."
6841,接下来我们将介绍一个正式的模型，它捕捉并阐明了地理学传统的见地，而且有完整的微观经济学基础。,
6841,,"What we want to do next is introduce a formal model, with complete microfoundations, that captures and clarifies the insights of the geography tradition."
6842,公共部门会从两个方面影响城市劳动市场。,The public sector can influence both sides of the urban labor market.
6842,例如，地力公共服务设施的供给，如学校、公园和公共安全，会增强城巾的相对吸引力，导致移民涌入，使劳动供给增加。,"For example, the provision of local public services such as schools, parks, and public safety increases the relative attractiveness of the city, causing in- migration that increases the supply of labor."
6842,在需求方而，工业基础设施（如道路、排水系统）的供给，降低了生产成本并吸引厂商。,"On the demand side, the provision of industrial infrastructure such as roads and sewer systems decreases production costs and attracts firms."
6843,城镇(towns)、郊区或小城市的功能与大城市的完全不同。,"Towns, suburbs and even little cities are totally different organisms from great cities."
6843,试图从小城镇的行为或者说想像的行为来理解大城市已经使我们陷入了足够的麻烦之中。,"We are in enough trouble already from trying to understand  big cities in terms of the behavior, and the imagined behavior, of towns."
6843,而试图从大城市的角度去理解小城镇则更会加剧混乱。,To try to understand towns in terms of big cities will only compound confusion.
6844,一位英国妇人位于画面中央，怀抱一个婴儿，另一个孩子在一旁玩耍，家庭平静的气氛被两个印度叛军的人侵所打破。,"With a young child playing next to her and a baby at her breast, a British woman is located at the centre of domestic and familial calm that has just been shattered by the invasion of two Indian insurgents."
6844,这两个男子的暴力举止只是一种标志，说明这个家庭是在印度而不是在英国。,The violent presence of these men is the only indication that the home is in India rather than Britain.
6844,叛军好像是要破坏这个毫无防御能力的妇女、她的孩子们以及这个家庭。,"The rebels appear set to destroy the defenceless woman, her children and the home itself."
6844,而且躺椅上盒子标 签的“英国”字样表明该民族与帝国力量的脆弱性。,"Moreover, the box labelled ‘England’ on the chaise-longue suggests the vulnerability of national and imperial power."
6845,不过，马克思预期“科学和技术将创造一个容易理解和可以操控的世界”，同时预期“只有资本主义关系才会妨碍”我们与自然的代谢关系之间合理调节。他的这些预期必然受到质疑。,"Nevertheless, Marx's expectation that ""science and technology would create an intelligible and controllable world as well as the expectation that only capitalist relations stand in the way of a rational regulation of our metabolism with nature, have to be questioned."
6845,这意味着对历史—地理唯物主义某些假设的挑战。,And this implies a challenge to some of the presumptions of historical–geographical materialism.
6846,单变量分析是一次只对一个变量进行的分析。,Univariate analysis involves the analysis of one variable at one time.
6846,单变量分析很容易通过描述与变量相关的频数分布来实现。,This is easily achieved by representing the frequency distribution associated with a variable.
6846,频数分布可以使用本章以前所讨论的数据输入及编码的任一方法来实现。,Frequency distributions can be developed using any of the methods of data entry and coding discussed previouslyin this chapter.
6846,从本质上讲，频数分布描述了答案选项中与每个种类相关的答案的数量。频数分布能够用于定类、定序及定距测量层次的变量。,"Essentially, the frequency distribution portrays the number of responses associated with each of the categories in a response set."
6847,这种“右翼乌托邦理想”与政治权力和实践之间的联系具有重要的意义。,"The connection between this ""right-wing Utopianism'' and political power and practice is significant."
6847,即使它完全不是占统治地位的观点(甚至在右派内部)，它亦是一种对抗反资本主义阵营的有力的亲资本主义武器。那些反资本主义阵营，以平等、正义、道德或仅仅是通俗易懂的政治经济和生态常识的名义，试图抑制、管制或取消所有明显的暴行，有充分理由说，资本主义在这些暴行上是臭名昭著的。,"Even if it is a far from dominant argument (even within the right) it is a potent pro-capitalist weapon with which to go to work against a whole array of forces that would, in the name of equality, justice, morality, or just plain political—economic and ecological common sense, seek to curb, regulate, and diminish all the manifest excesses for which capitalism is infamous."
6848,但是，道德共同体的观念同样被证明是有问题的。,But the notion of a moral community also proves problematic.
6848,我们可以看一看，它是如何在沙勾夫的著作中起作用的(Sagoff，1988)。,"Consider, for example, how it plays in the work of Sagoff (1988)."
6848,尽管个人常常表现为追求自己目标的纯粹利己主义的及原子式地构成的经济人，但他主张，他们不仅会而且往往确实在以完全不同的方式作为与环境问题密切相关的“道德共同体”的成员而行动(由此立法保护濒危物种)。,"While individuals often act as purely self-interested and atomistically constituted economic agents selfishly pursuing their own goals, he argues, they not only can but frequently do act in completely different ways as members of a ""moral community"" particularly with respect to environmental issues (hence legislation to protect endangered species)."
6849,让我们先来看一看地标作为多样性的“发布者”和“扩大者” 所起的作用。,Let us first consider the role of landmarks as announcers and dignifiers of diversity.
6849,当然，一个地标(landmarks )之所以能起到标志作用是因为它 处在一个突出的位置。,"One reason a landmark can be a landmark is, of course, that it is in a spot where it shows to advantage."
6849,但是，除此以外，另外一个必要条件是地标本身还应该有突出的特征，我们现在要谈论的正是这一点。,"But in addition, it is necessary that the landmark be distinctive as a thing itself, and it is this poiot with which we are now concerned."
6850,“位置”这个词也承载着过多的意义。,"But the word ""place"" also carries a surfeit of meanings."
6850,首先，存在着各种各样的词，如环境、地点、位置、场所、邻里、地区、领土等等，它们都是指地方的一般特性。,"To begin with, there are all sorts of words such as milieu, locality, location, locale, neighborhood, region, territory, and the like, which refer to the generic qualities of place."
6850,也存在另外一些术语，如城市、乡村、集镇、都市以及国家等，它们指明某类特殊的地方，再者，如家、家庭、“帮会”、社区和民族等，它们具有同样强烈的地方内涵，这使得我们在谈论一个术语时很难不涉及其他术语。,"There are other terms such as city, village, town, megalopolis, and state which designate particular kinds of places and still others, such as home, hearth, ""turf,"" community, and nation, which have such strong connotations of place that it would be hard to talk about one without the other."
6851,当形成一种地理多样性的意像之后，就需要我们去进行解释。,"Along with the formation of a mental image of geodiversity, however, has existed our need to explain it."
6851,学者们建立了多种多样的解释方式，以求这种意像看似真实或者可以被接受。,Scholars formulated many different explanations to make the mental images seem plausible or acceptable.
6851,反过来，他们的解释又决定了他们选择进行深入观察的特点。,"Their explanations, in turn, often determined the features they chose to observe."
6852,"地理定位系统（GPS）和地理信息系统（GIS）的出现极大地改善了成果表述的精度（DeMers, 2000; Raper, 2000; Longley et al., 2001）。","The advent of geographical positioning systems (GPS) and geographical information systems (GIS) has greatly improved accuracy and presentation of results (Raper, 2000; DeMers, 2005; Longley et al., 2005)."
6852,许多地貌图的绘制是为了咨询报告和应用项目。,Many geomorphological maps are produced for consultancy reports and in applied projects.
6852,这些图常常是专门为某个地点或某种问题而绘制的，而且经常不在国有土地上。,These are often site- and problem-specific and may often not be in the public domain.
6853,因此，在提出概念、抽象和理论的时候，给空间、时间、规模和环境设置边界就成了主要的战略性考虑因素。,"Setting boundaries with respect to space, time, scale, and environment then becomes a major strategic consideration in the development of concepts, abstractions, and theories."
6853,这些边界的任何实质性变化都将彻底地改变概念、抽象和理论的本质，这是常见的情况。,"It is usually the case that any substantial change in these boundaries will radically change the nature of the concepts, abstractions, and theories."
6853,在地理学中，我们常常会遇到由生态关联的不同规模所致的以悖论形式出现的难题。,In geography we often encounter this problem in the form of the paradoxes generated by different scales of ecological correlation.
6853,在下文中，我们将经常遇到这种规模难题。,We will frequently encounter this scale problem in what follows.
6854,学界并没有一部统一的“地理学”史，只有林林总总、令人眼花缭乱的不同版本，彼此差异很大，而且往往是百家争鸣。,"There is no single history of ‘geography’, only a bewildering variety of different, often competing versions of the past."
6854,其中一种阐释记录了如下的历史变迁：从现代早期（early-modern）的航海，到18世纪启蒙运动的地理探险，再到19世纪晚期的“新”地理学，直至两次世界大战之间的区域地理学。,One such interpretation charts the transition from early-modern navigation to Enlightenment exploration to the ‘new’ geography of the late nineteenth century and the regional geography of the interwar period.
6854,本文所述的种种——就像所有其他地理学史一样——只不过反映了作者的偏好。,This contextualist account – like all other histories of geography – reflects the partialities of its author.
6855,电话调查可以与受访者进行个人交流；并且，与面对面的家庭访问调查相比，它能以较小成本从广泛的地区中抽取样本。,Telephone surveys enable personal contact to be made with respondents and samples may be drawn from a range of geographical regions for a lesser cost than face-to-face interviews conducted by household visits.
6855,另外，邮件调查只需一位研究者即可展开，而电话调查需要许多的调查者。,"On the other hand, whereas mail surveys can be conducted by one researcher, telephone surveys require a number of interviewers."
6855,而且这些调查者需要接受培训和监督以保证操作合理、规范，同时还需要支付他们工资，这就增加了总体的调查成本。,"These interviewers require training and supervision to ensure proper and ethical conduct, as well as having to be paid, which adds to the cost of the overall survey."
6856,位于昆士兰州罗克汉普顿（Rockhampton）的社会科学研究中心 (C4SSR），建有一个人口研究实验室（PRL）。,"The Centre for Social Science Research (C4SSR), Rockhampton (Qld), has a Population Research Laboratory (PRL)."
6856,这个实验室是专门围绝进行社会调查而建立起来的。,This laboratory is solely organised around the conduct of social surveys.
6856,该实验室配备了计算机辅助电话访谈（CAT1）技术和计算机辅助私人访谈（CAPI）软硬件技术。,The laboratory uses computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) and computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI) hardware and software.
6856,在1999年，社会科学研究中心进行了首次的昆士兰州中心区社会调查（CQSS）一个综合性调查。,"In 1999, the Centre for Social Science Research conducted the first Central Queensland Social Survey (CQSS), an omnibus survey."
6857,将前向关联模型化要稍难一些。,Forward linkages are a little harder to model.
6857,它们通常在生产中间产品的行业中出现（正如下文所述，虽然并不总是这样）；这意味着为了模型化前向关联，需要一个比墨菲、施莱佛和维什尼等人的大推进模型更复杂的结构。,"They ordinarily arise in the context of industries producing intermediate goods (although not always, as described below); this means that a more complex structure than the Murphy, Shleifer, Vishny version of the Big Push is necessary."
6857,而且，为了使不完全竞争易于处理，大推进模型假设厂商的定价受到限制，因而排除了任何前向联系的可能性，因为成本的节省不会传递给下游的消费者。,"Also, the limit-pricing assumption that makes imperfect competition easy in the Big Push model immediately rules out any forward linkage, since cost savings are never passed on to downstream consumers."
6858,定量研究报告与定性研究报告的不同之处在于所使用的主要写作方式和类型上。,The difference between qualitative and quantitative research reports is thestyle of writing and key genres used.
6858,定性研究报告采用叙述的文体形式，而定量研究报告使用科学报告的写作方式。,"Qualitative reports adopt a narrativestyle, whereas quantitative reports use the style of scientific writing."
6858,尽管并不总是按照相同的次序，但两者都包含了下列构成要素：引言、文献 综述、研究结果、讨论、结论和/或建议。,"Bothinclude the following structural elements, though not always in the sameorder: introduction, literature review, findings, discussion, conclusion and/or recommendations."
6859,具体的数据收集的方法包括问卷法、观察法、文档分析法以及实验和准实验的方法（这些方法将在第三章和第八章中做出解释）。,"The methods of data collection include questionnaires, observation, documentary analysis and experiments and quasi-experiments.(These methods are explained in chapters 3 and"
6859,数据分析通常采用统计方法，由此得出由数字表示的研究结论。,8.) Analysis will be conducted using statistical calculations and the units of study will subsequently become numeric representations.
6859,如何运用定量的研究方法对收集的数据进行分析，我们将在第九章中讨论。,Analysis of data gathered using a quantitative methodology is discussed in chapter9.
6860,定性研究方法植根于解释社会学范式，且与最近兴起的女性主义的研究方法相一致。,The qualitative approach is grounded in the interpretive social sciences paradigm and sits comfortably with the more recently espoused feminist approaches to the conduct of research.
6860,定性研究方法收集信息以形成许多个文本单元，这些文本单元再现了正在研究的旅游现象的社会现实、背景和特征。,"The qualitative methodology gathers information as text-based units, which represent the social reality, context and attributes of the tourism phenomenon under study."
6860,这种研究从方法论的角度看，其本质是归纳性的。,The methodology is inductive in nature.
6861,身份是一个既复杂又有争议的词，是关于我们如何理解和塑造我们自己的。,Identity is a complex and contested term that concerns how we understand who we are.
6861,"身份是相互关联的，也就是说，自我总是通过它不是什么——用理论术语来说,就是“他人”——来定义的。","Identities are relational, the Self is always defined in terms of the Other, that is in terms of difference, what it is not."
6861,换句话说，社会结构——自我和他人——是通过社会关系的认同和差异而产生的。,
6861,认同和差异的问题必定导致权力与对抗问題。,Questions of identification and difference necessarily entail issues of power and resistance.
6862,海姆继续评论道，单子可能“没有窗户，但它们的确具有终端”，并因此能够创建自己的对应原则，脱离身体的存在去建造网络、BBS和虚拟社区，成为社会原子主义的解药。,"Monads, Heim (1991: 67.-73) goes on to remark, may ""have no windows, but they do have terminals"" and they are thereby able to construct their own correspondence principles, breaking free from a bodily existence to build networks, bulletin boards and virtual communities as:computer antidotes to the atomism of society."
6862,它们使单子聚集起来。,They assemble the monads.
6862,它们起到社会节点的作用，为那些变动不居的单子培育多重可以随意选择的亲和关系。事实上，日常的城市几乎不支持这种亲和关系。,"They function as social nodes for fostering those fluid and multiple elective affinities that everyday urban life seldom, in fact, supports."
6862,(Heim，1991：67—73),
6863,研究者应该确保他们的调查问卷收集的数据是为了研究目的需要。,Researchers should ensure that their questionnaire collects the data theyrequire for their research purpose.
6863,问题的措辞很重要——研究者应该使用简单的语言；做到用语简练、单意，避免引导性、含糊不清的问题；采用过滤性问题；恰当定义；适当的时间性框架;合理分类。,"The wording of the questions is important — researchers should use simple language; short, single-focused, nonleading, unambiguous questions; filter questions; definitions; temporal frames when appropriate; and categories."
6863,答案选项在本质上应该是穷尽的、互斥的和单一尺度的。,"Responses sets should be exhaustive, mutually exclusive and unidimensional in nature."
6863,答案选项的种类包括使用对照表、排序量表、李克特量表、语义差异量表和情景法。,"Response sets include the use of checklists, ranking scales, Likert scales, semantic differential scales and scenarios.Pilot studies should be used to ensure that the survey is well constructed."
6864,描述性统计能够使调查人员以数字术语来描述收集的原始数据（Neuman 2000，p.317）。,"Descriptive statistics enable researchers to describe the aggregation of raw data in numerical terms (Neuman 2000, p. 317)."
6864,描述性统计包括使用单变量分析、双变量分析及多变量分析。,"Descriptive statistics involve the use of univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis."
6864,这些分析方法包括使用频数分布、百分比表格以及集中趋势量数。,"These methods of analysis incorporate the use of frequency distributions, percentage tables and measures of central tendency."
6865,物种和活动对特殊小环境的适应和多样化也是一种既合作又竞争 的形式，结果就是以那种使合作形式多样化而不是单一化的方式改造环境。,Adaptation and diversification of species and activities into special niches is also a form of both competition and collaboration and the effect is to transform environments in ways that may make the latter more rather than less diverse.
6865,物种或许会多样化，进一步创造更加多样的合适环境。,Species may diversify further creating more diversified niches.
6865,一个更加多样化的自然的生产反过来生产了更大的物种多样性。,The production of a more diversified nature in turn produces greater diversity of species.
6866,没有城市，它们就根本不可能 存在。,"Without cities, they would simply not exist."
6866,它们依赖于城市中的其他形式各样的企业，同时也为这种多样性添砖加瓦。,"Dependent on a huge diversity of other city enterprises, they can add further to that diversity."
6866,这一点是最应该让我们记住的地方。,This last is a most important point to remember.
6866,城市的多样性(diversity)本身就会带来和刺激更多的多样性的产生。,City diversity itself permits and stimulates more diversity.
6867,"通常研究者借助多变量分析来证明任何双变量的关系并不是“假的”（Neuman 2000, p. 333)。","Researchers use multivariate analysis to ensure that any bivariate relationship is not 'spurious' (Neuman 2000, p. 333)."
6867,三个变量的分析可以使用表格或者多元回归分析来进行。,Trivariate analysis may be conducted using tables or multiple regression analysis.
6867,三元表格由控制变量每一个类别的自变量值和因变量值的二维表格构成。,
6867,,"A trivariate table is made up of bivariate tables that represent the values 'of the independent and dependent variables for each category of the control variable' (Neuman, 2000, p. 333)."
6868,有关“承认政治”和“多元文化主义”的那些激烈辩论已经用另一种方式提出了这些问题。,"These questions have been posed in another way in the contested and often testy debates on the ""politics of recognition"" and on ""multiculturalism."""
6868,"在此，我从沃尔泽(Walzer, 1983:314)的“彻底的特殊主义”理论表述开始讨论。那一理论认为，“分配正义的每种实质性解释都是局部的”。","I begin here with Walzer's (1983: 314) formulation of a ""radically particularist"" theory in which ""every substantive account of distributive justice is a local account."
6868,,'
6869,罗森斯坦一罗丹和刘易斯强调有弹性的劳动供给是发展过程中的关键因素。,Rosenstein-Rodan and Lewis stressed the elasticity of labor supply as a key factor in development.
6869,其他学者如纳克斯(1952)则强调有弹性的资本供给。,"Other authors, such as Nurkse (1952), stressed the elasticity of capital supply."
6869,特别值得一提的是，赫希曼（1958)不厌其烦地强调投资机会可以在多大程度上带来更多的储蓄。,"In particular, Hirschman (1958) emphasized at length the extent to which investment opportunities could bring forth additional savings."
6870,在前面两次讲座中，我就两个领域的思想史讲了一些个人的看法，奇怪的是它们都没能对经济学中的主流思想产生什么影响。,In the previous two lectures I offered personal views of the history of thought in two fields that were strangely unsuccessful in influencing mainstream thought in economics.
6870,发展经济学，或者更确切地说被我称为“超发展理论”的那些思想最初曾有过巨大的影响。,"Development economics, or more specifically the set of ideas that I call ''high development theory,"" had a huge initial influence."
6870,但是它日渐衰落，事实上正在从经济学文献中消失。,"But it then faded away, virtually disappearing from economic discourse."
6871,在所有发展经济学文献中，最著名的莫过于阿瑟•刘易斯的《劳动无限供给下的经济发展》（1954)。,"Probably the most famous paper in all of development economics is Arthur Lewis's ""Economic Development with Unlimited Supplies of Labor"" (1954)."
6871,但现在想起来，原因并不那么清楚。,
6871,,"In retrospect, it is hard to see exactly why."
6871,对刘易斯观点的一种解释是在发展中国家从农业部门中吸引过来的劳动的影子价格为零或至少很低，这样在工业部门投资的社会收益超过了个人收益。,"One interpretation of Lewis's argument is that the shadow price of labor drawn from the agricultural sector in developing countries is zero or at least low, so that the social return to investment in industry exceeds its private return."
6872,由于被剥夺了任何自主的生命力，自然容易根据人类的意志没有节制地被操纵。,"Deprived of any autonomous life force, nature was open to be manipulated without restraint according to the human will."
6872,如海德格尔后来抱怨的那样，自然成为人类开采的“巨大的加油站”。,"Nature became, as Heidegger later complained, ""one vast gasoline station"" for human exploitation."
6872,"按照法兰克福学派的意见，这种分析所忽略的是内部关系的辩证法，其中，自然“既是某种外在于人类的东西又是一种内部现实"" (Jay，1973: 267)。","What this analysis elided, according to the Frankfurt School, was the dialectics of internal relations in which nature was both ""something external to man but also an internal reality"" (Jay, 1973: 267)."
6873,出于人道和进步的原因，引入反机构化是想洗清与许多大型机构相关的污名和恶劣环境。,Deinstitutionalization was introduced for humane and progressive reasons in an attempt to overcome the stigma and poor conditions associated with many large institutions.
6873,然而，在经济衰退期，这个政策也常常被看做是节约开支的一种方式。,"However, in an era of fiscal retrenchment, the policy has often been seen as a way of saving money."
6873,因此，大型机构被迅速关闭，可是又没有建立起足够的基于社区的设施。,"As a result, large institutions have been closed very rapidly without the development of sufficient community-based facilities."
6873,该政策也基于这样一个假设，即有大量后备自愿者（通常是女性）准备为那些从大机构出来的人服务，但这个假设通常是错误的。,The policy was also based on the assumption that there was a large reserve of volunteers (usually women) who were prepared to care for those released from large institutions --- an assumption that was often mistaken.
6873,那些没有家庭支持的人常常会租房子住，且倾向于在内城地区租房子，因而这些地区常常有显性精神病患者。,"Those without family support have often ended up in rented accommodation and, since this tends to be located in inner-city areas, these display the greatest concentrations of ex-psychiatric patients."
6874,反身性不仅是女性主义范式所关注的问题，也是解释社会学范式（特别是民族志研究）、批评理论以及后现代主义的后结构“形式”所关心的问题。,"As well as being a feminist issue,  reflexivity is also a concern of the interpretive social sciences (especially ethnographic studies), critical theory and the poststructuralist 'form' of postmodernism."
6874,哈丁（1991)解释说，反身性对于实证主义科学家来说是一个难题，因为他们的理解被“人为地限制在实验室和研究团队的微观过程”。尤为突出的是，实证主义者倾向于“将研究群体从其所处的更广泛的社会、政治、经济现实中分离出去”（Harding 1991，p.162）,"Harding (1991) also posits that reflexivity is a problem for those scientists operating within a positivist paradigm, as their understanding is 'artificially restricted to the micro processes of the laboratory and research community', particularly because of the positivist tendencies to 'isolat[e] research communities from the larger social, economic, and political currents in their societies' (Harding 1991, p. 162)."
6875,这样的干扰因素可能会掩盖一个人的心理类型。,Such intervening conditions may mask a person's psychographic type.
6875,对巡游者进行的研究没有采用普劳格用来确定心理类型的五个问题（参见 Plog 1990）。,The study of cruisers did not draw on the five questions Plog uses to determine psychographic type (see Plog 1990).
6875,但是，如果普劳格的个性特征得以完善，然后对从巡游者身上、同时从在位和出位的视角出发收集到的数据使用方法的三角校正， 应该能够得出相似的结果。,"However, if Plog's characteristics are well founded then methodological triangulation using both etically and emically gathered data collected on cruisers should achieve a similar outcome."
6876,在研究计划的准备过程中，务必确保信息的完整性，提供包括引言、文献综述、方法论、工作进度表、经费预算表、参考文献和简历等方面的信息。,"When preparing your research proposal, ensure that you provide information on all sections: the introduction, literature review, methodology, time line, budget, references and curriculum vitae."
6876,保证准时提交研究计划，过晚提交的计划一般不会被接受。,"Ensure that the proposal is submitted on time, as late submissions are generally not accepted."
6876,同时确保研究计划整体形式的专业性，所有必要的附件一应俱全。,"Furthermore, ensure that the proposal has been professionally presented and all attachments have been included."
6877,研究者可以通过参与观察和深度访谈来解释由于跨国企业对接待地社区旅游企业的干预所造成的负面效应。,Through participant observation and indepth interviewing the researcher will be able to determine the negative impacts of the involvement of the multinational corporations in tourism enterprises upon the host community.
6877,研究成果可以应用在进行与接待地社区和旅游相关的重大实践变革中。,The findings from the research would then be used to effect transformational changes to current practices in relation to the host community and tourism.
6877,一般而言，此种研究需要为支持和许可接待地社区的变革寻找理由。,"Basically, the researcher in such a study would be required to champion the cause of the host community to facilitate change and empower the host community."
6878,原始资料或二手资料的使用取决于研究项目本身、使用的范式和一些外部因素诸如时间、金钱等的限制。,"The use of primary or secondary data depends on the research project, the overlying paradigm and any external factors such as time and monetary constraints."
6878,对于旅游研究者来说，资料来源是很广泛的。,"For tourism researchers, data sources are extensive."
6878,原始资料可以通过观察法、访谈法、专家小组或问卷调查法等方式收集。,"Primary data may be gathered by using observation, interviews, panel groups or questionnaires."
6879,调査者完成问卷（或面对面访问）可能耗时办小时，而问题可多达10页。,Interviewer-completed questionnaires (or face-to-face interviews) can be from half an hour in duration or up to 10 pages of questions.
6879,调査者完成问卷的结构与第六章提到的访问法类似。,Interviewer-completed questionnaires are akin to structured interviews mentioned in chapter 6.
6879,在问题的排序和问题答案的甄选方面极为严密。,"As a consequence, the interviews are rigid in the order of question framing and in the choice of question responses."
6879,为避免任何的研究者偏见，问题大多是封闭型的。,Questions are generally closed questions to remove any researcher bias.
6880,访谈的目的是引导受访者表述观点，因而采访者不应控制谈话。,"The interviewer should not dominate the conversation, as the purpose is to elicit the views of the interviewee."
6880,然而采访者可能不得不准备好与受访者一同成为研究主体，尤其当整个研究所依据的是女性主义视角的方法论或受访者有交流的需要时更是如此。,"However, the interviewer may have to be ready to become a subject together with the interviewee, especially if the research has a feminist methodological basis or the interviewee makes reciprocity demands."
6880,在非结构化访谈中，采访者对访谈的控制程度最小，因为受访者实际上有时也用他们的想法引导着访谈。,"In unstructured interviews, control by the interviewer is minimal, as the interviewee is really leading the interview with their thoughts."
6881,在分层随机抽样中，研究者必须考虑在确定样本容量时是釆用比例抽样还是非比例抽样的方式。,"In stratified random sampling, a researcher has to remember to consider proportionate or disproportionate sample sizes."
6881,在上面的例子中，七个交换台的抽样比例都是相等的——如果我们按不同的比例抽样，结果就不能反映总体。,"The above example sampled seven exchanges in proportions equal to the population — had we been sampling disproportionately, the results would not have represented the population."
6881,有时，当一个层次的结果可能会产生没有意义的结论时，我们就使用不同比例的抽样规模。,"Sometimes, disproportionate sample sizes are used when the results of a strata may yield insignificant results."
6882,坦率地说，当这种大众主体转向与任何一种内部关系哲学结合起来的时候，它便造成了严重的危险——它产生了最坏形式的“莱布尼茨式奇想”。,"Plainly, this massive subjective turn poses acute dangers when coupled with any philosophy of internal relations – it produces the very worst forms of what I have already dubbed ""the Leibnizian conceit."""
6882,不过，它亦推动了虽然危险但是有用的“我”与“它”之间的分离，这种分离为现代科学研究“在自然中”发挥作用的过程提供了基础。,"But it also facilitates that useful though dangerous separation between ""I"" and ""it"" that grounds modern scientific enquiry into the processes at work ""in nature."""
6882,那种分离是解开自然奥秘从而推动解放和自我实现的关键。,That separation was the key to unlocking the secrets of nature so as to facilitate emancipation and self-realization.
6883,分区规划指对城市中每块土地的使用做出一套可被认可的规定。,A zoning plan designates a set of admissible land uses for each plot of land in a city.
6883,从理论上讲，分区制的目的是为了提高公众健康，安全和福利水平。达到这些目的的基本手段是将使用目的互不相容的土地分离开来。,"In theory, the purpose of zoning is to promote public health, safety, and welfare- The principal means of promoting health, safety, and welfare is the separation of incompatible land uses."
6884,调査者完成问卷（或面对面访问）可能需要半小时才能完成或者问题可多达10页。,Interviewer-completed questionnaires (or face-to-face interviews) can befrom half an hour in duration or up to 10 pages of questions.
6884,调査者完成问卷的结构与第六章提到的访问法类似。,Interviewercompleted questionnaires are akin to structured interviews mentioned in chapter 6.
6884,在问题的排序和问题 答案的甄选方面极为严密。,"As a consequence, the interviews are rigid in the order of question framing and in the choice of question responses."
6884,为避免任何的研究者偏见，问题大多是封闭型的。,Questions are generally closed questions to remove any researcher bias.
6885,借由空间秩序安排而进行的社会控制的复杂性(以及相反，社会秩序因为空间边界越轨而受到挑战的复杂方式)需要深人分析。,"The intricacy of social control by spatial ordering (and, conversely, the complex ways in which social orders get challenged by the transgression of spatial boundaries) requires sophisticated analysis."
6885,例如，象征空间和空间秩序安排的符号学创建了各种必须依据社会条件阅读的文本。,"Symbolic spaces and the semiotics of spatial orderings, for example, create texts that have to be read in social terms."
6885,家庭、工厂和城市的内部时空组织是相反的社会力量为争取稳定或打破社会意义而进行的斗争的结果。,"The internal spatio-temporal organization of the household, of workplaces, of cities, is the outcome of struggles to stabilize or disrupt social meanings by opposed social forces."
6886,因父权制的权力关系所导致的差异也有空间性。,The differences produced by patriarchal relations of power are spatialized as well.
6886,与父权制有关的空间分异最有意义的形式之一就是私密空间和公共空间的差异。,One of the most significant forms of spatial difference associated with patriarchy is that between private and public space.
6886,如女性主义者和其他理论家所阐明的那样，这种通常采纳的特性(这个常见的习惯成自然的划分) 是政治性的典型产物，并不那么容易保持；这两种空间和它们所代表的范围边界是模糊的、相互交叉的。,"As feminist and other theorists have made clear, this commonly naturalized distinction is a political artefact and not so easily maintained; the two spaces and the spheres they represent blur and intersect."
6887,目录页需列出以下几项：报告摘要、序言/前言、致谢、表格和图表目录、章节标题、参考文献和附录。,"The contents page lists the following items: executive summary, preface/foreword, acknowledgments, list of tables and list of figures, chapters, subsections, references and appendices."
6887,从报告摘要到致谢部分需要使用罗马数字标注页码。,Roman numerals are used for pagesfrom  the executive summary through to the acknowledgments section.
6887,目录页不必列在其中，但各章要分成多个小节(参见图10-6)。,"Thecontents page itself is not listed on the contents page, and chapters areorganised into subsections (see figure 10.6)."
6888,在某种意义上，存在着另外一些相互之间完全不同的可能世界。,These are alternative possible worlds in some sense fundamentally different from each other.
6888,这些可能世界并非完全存在于人类经验之外，虽然莱布尼茨可能合理地主张，在某种意义上，他们描述的世界外在于物质性的感觉世界。,"Such possible worlds are not entirely outside of human experience, though Leibniz might reasonably claim that in some sense the worlds they depict are outside of the material world of sense perception."
6888,莱布尼茨对多种可能的时空世界的研究只是一种逻辑构造。,Leibniz's findings on multiple possible worlds of space and time are purely logical constructs.
6888,不过，我们可以将之作为一种工具来进一步研究实际时空秩序安排——这种安排是在不同的生产方式和社会构型之中和之间进行的——的差异。,But they can be used as a means to look more closely at the differentiation of actual spatial and temporal orderings within and between different modes of production and social formations.
6889,时空的生产不可避免地同身体的生产联系在一起。,The production of space—time is inextricably connected with the production of the body.
6889,列斐伏尔抱怨，“随着笛卡儿逻辑的出现，空间进人了绝对王国……空间最终通过容纳它们而统治全部的感觉和身体”(Lefebvre，1991:1)。,"""With the advent of Cartesian logic,"" Lefebvre (1991: 1) complains, ""space had entered the realm of the absolute ... space came to dominate, by containing them, all senses and all bodies."""
6889,列斐伏尔和福柯(特别是在《规训和惩罚》中)在此从事着共同的事业：把感觉和人类身体从人为的时间和空间世界的绝对主义中解放出来，这是他们解放战略的中心。,Lefebvre and Foucault (particularly in Discipline and Punish) here make common cause: the liberation of the senses and the human body from the absolutism of that produced world of space and time becomes central to their emancipatory strategies.
6890,自变量有时也被称为原因变量（Neuman 2000)或改变变量（Kumar 1996)。,The independent variable is sometimes referred to as the causal variable (Neuman 2000) or change variable (Kumar 1996).
6890,因变量也可称为结果变量（Kumar 1996)。,The dependent variable is also referred to as the outcome variable (Kumar 1996).
6890,此外还有其他一些变量，比如：外生变量（表示因变量受自变量影响的变化程度的变量）和干涉变量（使自变量对因变量发生影响的变量）。,"There are other variables, such as extraneous variables (variables that influence the degree of impact of the independent variable on the dependent variable) and intervening variables (variables that need to be present for the independent variable to influence the dependent variable)."
6891,其他用于问卷设计的量表当属瑟斯东和哥特曼量表了。,Other scales that may be used in questionnaire construction are Thurstone scales and Guttman scales.
6891,瑟斯东量表用于测量态度，但该量表需由专家决定其结构且较为耗时，并且还要求为纳入此量表的项目做出相关评判（Babbie 1990)。,"Thurstone scales are used to measure attitudes; however, the scale is dependent upon experts for its construction.Thurstone scales are time-consuming and demanding in judging items relevant for inclusion (Babbie 1990)."
6891,哥特曼量表用于测量社会距离，特别是测量受访者所接受的与其他类型人的社会距离（Sarantakos 1998)。,"Guttman scales measure social distance, particularly how close a respondent will allow another type of person to be to them (Sarantakos 1998) ."
6892,瓦解过程总是发挥着作用，挑战对资本积累施加政治压力那些特殊“永恒”。,"And processes of dissolution are always at work, bringing into question the particular ""permanences"" shaped to bring political pressure to bear upon capital accumulation."
6892,这就是阶级过程所包含的全部内容。,This is what the process of class is all about.
6892,某些“永恒”(诸如工会)在特定时间和地方形成，多少都会对某一空间内的资本积累过程暂时产生影响。,"Certain ""permanences"" (such as trade unions) form in a given place and time and are more or less effective in relation to processes of capital accumulation across a certain space for a time."
6893,为回答这个问题，法兰克福学派决定仔细审视美学传统。,"To do this, the Frankfurt School chose to pay very close attention to the esthetic tradition."
6893,但是，阿多诺问，奥斯威辛之后，什么样的美学是可能的呢?,"But what kind of esthetic was possible after Auschwitz, asked Adorno?"
6893,那个问题同样受到了考验，而答案则是五花八门。,That question is also put to the test and the answer is as nuanced as it is problematic.
6893,解放感官的生命从而鼓励回到那些被工具理性和启蒙理性压抑的东西，那总是好的。,It is all very well to liberate the life of the senses to foster the return of all that had been repressed by instrumental rationality and Enlightenment reason.
6894,"传统的歧视理论认为市场力量限制了工资歧视的程度（Becker, 1957）：假设某市冇两种类型的工人——黑人和白人，两者有着相同的边际收益产品（MRP），即劳动力的边际实物产品与该产品的市场价格之乘积。","The traditional theory of discrimination suggests that market forces limit the extent of wage discrimination (Becker, 1957).Consider a city with two types of workers, black and white, who have the same marginal revenue product (MRP), defined as the marginal physical product of labor times the market price of the product produced."
6894,假定白人的工资按照他们的(6美元)被支付，而黑人仅仅被支付5美元。,Suppose that white workers are paid their MRP ($6) but blacks are paid only $5.
6894,如果你是一个追求利润最大化的厂商，你会怎么做？,"If you were a profit-maximizing firm, what would you do?"
6895,工作进度有多种形式:可以选择使用矩阵的形式通过日、周、月来观察任务的进展情况，也可以选择使用重要事件法。,"Time lines can be presented in several ways.You may choose to use a matrix to gain an overall view of the tasks by days, weeks or months, or you may choose to use a milestone technique."
6895,图10-4对两种方法都做了举例说明。,Both techniques are illustrated in figure 10.
6895,准备工作进度时，需提供充分的细节——有时所给的计划太笼统，不能让读者明确你计划能力的整体有效性。,"4. When preparing a time line, ensure that you provide enough detail — sometimes the tasks noted are very general and do not enable a reader to determine the overall effectiveness of your planning ability."
6895,当然，也不应该过于严苛而为研究项目制定过分细致的时间表。,"On the other hand, you should not be so prescriptive that you are presenting a minute-by-minute account of the timing for the project."
6896,就生态运动中强烈的马尔萨斯主义那一翼来说，加雷特•哈丁可能是最重要的代表，他诉诸的极权主义方案明显是“公地悲剧”唯一可能的政治解决办法。,"In the case of the strongly Malthusian wing of the ecological movement, and Garrett Hardin is probably the best representative, the appeal to authoritarian solutions is explicit as the only possible political solution to the ""tragedy of the commons."""
6896,大多数这种类型的文本都假设，资源匮乏（以及随之产生的增长极限）和人口压力是环境—生态问题的核心。,Most of the writing in this genre presumes that resource scarcities (and consequent limits to growth) and population pressure lie at the heart of the environmental—ecological issue.
6896,因为这些在20世纪70年代早期是最重要的问题，这种类型的辩论也因此在那时达到高峰。,"Since these issues were paramount in the early 1970s, this style of argument was then also at its height."
6897,在很多人口集中和用途多样化的城市地区，人们仍是以步行为主，但在郊区或大部分灰色地带，步行则根本行不通。,"In dense, diversified city areas, people still walk, an activity that is impractical in suburbs and in most gray areas."
6897,一个地方的多样性越是丰富多彩同时又有条不紊，人们就越会愿意 步行。,"The more intensely various and close-grained the diversity in an area, the more walking."
6897,即使是开车或通过公共交通(public transportation)从外面来到多样化的充满活力的地方，他们到达那里后也会步行。,"Even people who come into a lively, diverse area from outside, whether by car or by public transponation, walk when they get there."
6898,大多数人行道上的公共人物都会稳定地处于一些公共场所。,Most public sidewalk characters are steadily stationed in public places.
6898,他们是店主或酒吧的主人或诸如此类的人。,They  are storekeepers or barkeepers or the like.
6898,这些人是一些最基本的公共人物。,These are the basic public characters.
6898,城市的其他公共人物都依赖于他们——哪怕只是间地，因为人行道的存在是通过这些小企业和商业及其它们的主人来体现的。,All other public characters of city sidewalks depend on them---if only indirectly because of the presence of sidewalk routes to such enterprises and their proprietors.
6899,因此，纽约公共图书馆(public library)在这一地区接到投诉电话多于其他地方也就不足为奇了。电话自然都是在中午时分打过来的，问的都是同一个问题:“图书馆这里的分部在哪里？我找不到。”原本就没有，否则这就是一个最麻烦的问题了。,"It is no accident that the New York Public Library gets more anguished telephone calls from this district than from any other --- at lunchtime, of course---asking, ""Where is the library branch down here? I can't find it."""
6899,这是此地区最典型的现象了。,"There is none, typically enough."
6900,本部分把分区分为二种类型。,
6900,其中， 公害分区（nuisance zoning)的目的是把不相容的土地利用分离开来。,The purpose of nuisance zoning is to separate incompatible land uses.
6900,城市通过财政分区（fiscal zoning)把那些不为当地政府分担费用份额的家庭排除在外。,Cities use fiscal zoning to exclude households that would not pay their share of the costs of local government.
6901,1991年的马斯特里克条约致力于为欧盟国家的一体化铺平道路，其核心目标之一就是更大程度地提高社会和经济的凝聚性。,The promotion of greater social and economic cohesion was one of the key objectives of the 1991 Maastricht Treaty that paved the way for greater integration of the EU states.
6901,不过，这一条约将欧洲移民分成两个阶层：一是与其他欧洲国家边境相邻的500万欧洲居民，他们有权在欧盟国家中迁移；二是来自欧盟国家之外的1000万非欧洲移民，他们虽已长期定居，但还没有取得完整的公民权，也无权迁往其他的欧盟成员国。,"However, this treaty created two classes of immigrants within Europe: first, there are the 5 million European residents living in the boundaries of other European nations with the right to movement within the European Union; and second, there are the 10 million non-European immigrants from outside the European Union who, although long-settled, do not have full citizenship or the right to move to other EU member states."
6901,这种划分的目的是创建一种“欧洲要塞”政策和抑制人口迁移，包括那些来自欧盟以外的难民和寻求避难的人士。,"The aim of this division is to create a‘Fortress Europe’ policy and inhibit immigration, including that from refugees and asylum-seekers out-side the European Union."
6902,在劳动阶层中引起的恐慌，造成了马克思称谓的陷入悲惨状况。,The havoc wreaked on the working class created what Marx termed its immiseration.
6902,他相信是资本主义使工人变得卑微，虽然他们的生存物质状况可能得到改善。,"He believed that capitalism degrades workers, even though their material conditions of existence may be improved."
6902,他们日益变成一种可交换的商品，一种在复杂的劳动分工中微不足道的因素。,"They become increasingly a commodity to be traded, a minute element in the complex division of labour."
6902,异化是商品拜 物教的结果，资本主义就以商品拜物教为其特征：一切都被贬低成货币项目，而人的尊严却丧失了。,Alienation is the result of the commodity fetishism that characterizes capitalism: everything is reduced to monetary terms and human dignity is lost.
6902,这种异化只有通过引人共产主义才能驱除。,Such alienation can only be removed by the introduction of communism.
6903,我们的城市缺少一些小型的公园活动，它们可以起到小的“必需物品”的作用。,"Cities lack minor park activities that could serve as minor ""demand goods."""
6903,有些时候，当人们需要，才会发现这些活动的重要性。,Some are discoverable by observation of what people try to do if they can get away  with it.
6903,比如，蒙特利尔附近一家购物中心(shopping centers)的经理发现每天早上他那做装饰用的水池都会神秘地变得很脏，经过秘密观察 一阵子后，他发现一些孩子们偷偷地在这里擦洗他们的自行车。,"For instance,the manager of a  shopping center near Montreal found his ornamental pool mysteriously filthy every morning.Spying after closing hours he found that children were sneaking in and  washing and polishing their bikes there."
6904,这些发展的一个主要结果就是公司变得更小了。,A major consequence of these developments is that firms are becoming much smaller.
6904,其主要原因是现有公司的细分（有时被称作垂直分化（vertical disintegration))，以及新的小公司的快速增长。,This has arisen because existing firms have been subdivided (sometimes known as vertical disintegration) as well as through the rapid growth of new small firms.
6904,与福特制支配下的内部规模经济不同，后福特制企业建立在外部范围经济上。,"Rather than the internal economies of scale dominant under Fordism, neo-Fordist firms are therefore based on external economies of scope."
6904,范围经济 (Economies of scope)是这样一些因素，它们使得生产系列产品成为可能，而不是生产单个产品。,Economies of scope are factors that make it possible to produce a range of products rather than to produce an individual item on its own.
6904,当企业所属的产业做大时（例如，有大量的生产者），外部范围经济（External economies of scope)就得到增长。,External economies of scope arise when the industry to which the firm belongs to is large (i.e.there are a large number of producers).
6905,例如，研究者可以使用滚雪球抽样来研究冒险旅游者。,"The researcher could use snowball sampling, for example, to study extreme adventure tourists."
6905,这些旅游者基本上是独立的，不依靠旅游企业来组织他们的极限冒险旅游活动。,These tourists are primarily independent tourists who are not dependent on the tourism industry to organise their extreme adventure travel experiences.
6905,因此，根本无法获得现成的抽样框，而仅仅在极端冒险者之间存在非正式的联系。,"Consequently, there are no readily available sampling frames, only informal networks of association between the extreme adventure tourists themselves."
6906,浏览同类词辞典、关键词数据库及主题字典（例如，在文献中旅游者可能被描述成国内旅游者，国际旅游者、旅行者、参观者、一日游游客或短程旅游者。旅行的动机可能被记录为旅行的原因或参观、 旅行的目的。所以仅从字面来看，第一个关键词可能搜索不到任何信息，这样就需要使用不同的词来描述概念）。,"Look in thesauri, key word databases and subject dictionaries.(For example, in the literature, tourist could be described a s domestic tourist, international tourist, traveller, visitor, daytripper or excursionist, and motivation for travel could be recorded as reasons for travel or purpose of visit/trip. So think laterally. Your first key word choice may draw a blank in a search, and you need to think of alternative ways of describing your concept.)"
6907,我们能够理解“物”之(矛盾的)质和量属性的唯一方式是理解构造它们的和内在于它们的过程和关系。,"The only way we can understand the (contradictory) qualitative and quantitative attributes of ""things"" is by understanding the processes and relationships which constitute them and which they internalize."
6907,除了通过内在于我的新陈代谢的、社会的和其他的过程，否则就不能理解作为个体的我。,"I, as an individual, cannot be understood except by way of the metabolic, social, and other processes which I internalize."
6907,无论如何，这暗示着，我必然使异质性以及一系列关联在一起的矛盾内在化。,"This implies, however, that I necessarily internalize heterogeneity and a bundle of associated contradictions."
6908,空间障碍的消除和“通过时间消灭空间”的斗争对于全部资本积累的动态来说都是根本性的，并且在资本过度积累危机时期更是剧烈。,"The elimination of spatial barriers and the struggle to ""annihilate space by time"" is essential to the whole dynamic of capital accumulation and becomes particularly acute in crises of capital overaccumulation."
6908,通过向新领域的地理扩张以及建构全新的空间关系来吸收剩余资本(有时是剩余劳动力)可以说是很显著的。,The absorption of surpluses of capital (and sometimes labor) through geographical expansion into new territories and through the construction of a completely new set of space relations has been nothing short of remarkable.
6908,列斐伏尔(1974)敏锐地指出，空间关系以及全球空间体制的建构和重构是资本主义残存到20世纪的主要手段之一。,"The construction and reconstruction of space relations and of the global space economy, as Henri Lefebvre (1974) acutely observes, has been one of the main means to permit the survival of capitalism into the twentieth century."
6909,"地貌学中的形态制图是从沃特斯(Waters, 1958)和萨维杰(Savigear, 1965)的工作发展起来的。",Morphological mapping in geomorphology developed from the work of Waters (1958) and Savigear (1965).
6909,"空间单位用坡折符号画出，特殊地貌特征用专门符号表示(Bakker, 1963)。","Spatial units are defined using symbols for breaks of slope, and particular geomorphological features are shown using specific symbols (Bakker, 1963)."
6909,"制图可在野外完成，也可用航空照片完成(Verstappen, 1983)。","Mapping may be completed in the field as well as from aerial photography (Verstappen, 1983)."
6909,"还可能包括更复杂的制图，例如利用物质发生与本性有关的信息(Demel et al., 1972)。","Further sophistication may be included, for example, by information on the genesis and nature of materials (Demek et al., 1972)."
6910,亚文化理论与合成理论紧密相联。,Subcultural theory is closely related to compositional theory.
6910,像后者一样，亚文化理论也认为，有着特定社会人口统计特征和特定生活方式的社会群体会宣传鼓吹某种行为。,"Like the latter, subcultural theory subscribes to the idea of social worlds with distinctive socio-demographic characteristics and distinctive lifestyles that propagate certain forms of behaviour."
6910,另外，亚文化理论还认为，这些社会群体或被称为亚文化者的数量会因城市生活的矛盾和竞争而增多；并且大批移民的到来所形成的特殊群体，以及因工业化和城市化导致的结构差异所产生的特殊群体都会孵化出新的亚文化者，并逐渐达到维系稳定社会网络所需之“临界数量”的规模。,"In addition, however, subcultural theory holds that these social worlds, or subcultures, will be intensified by the conflict and competition of urban life; and that new subcultures will be spawned as specialized groups generated by the arrival of immigrants and by the structural differentiation resulting from industrialization and urbanization reach the ‘critical mass’ required to sustain cohesive social networks."
6911,在自然地理学中，动态分析开始流行，低地地貌学也被广泛接受。,"In physical geography dynamic analysis became popular, and lowland geomorphology won wide acceptance."
6911,计量方法被采纳，用于海岸地貌和河流变化过程的研究。,Quantitative approaches were adopted with regard to coastal landforms and fluvial processes.
6911,与山地冰川有关的河流阶地研究，以及海平面变化等与气候变化有关的研究得到了更多的关注。,The work of river terraces in relation to mountain glaciation and changes in sea level and other matters relating to climatic change were more thoroughly investigated.
6912,当然，现在仍然有许多优秀的学者致力于发展中国家的经济学研究。,"There are, of course, many excellent people who work on the economics of developing countries."
6912,他们提出的某些问题是各国都普遍存在的，但另外一些则是较贫穷的国家特有的问题，因此从这个意义上来说，现在仍然有一个集中研究欠发达国家的经济问题的领域。,"Some of the problems they address are essentially generic to all countries, but there are also issues that are characteristic of poorer countries in particular, and in this sense there is a field that focuses on the economics of underdevelopment."
6912,不过它是一个发散的领域：比如研究第三世界农业的经济学家与研究发展中国家制成品贸易的经济学家即使有共同的研究内容，也微乎其微，他们也与研究债务、恶性通货膨胀等宏观经济学问题的经济学家没有共同语言。,"But it is a diffuse field: those who work on the economics of, say, Third World agriculture have little if any overlap with those who work on LDC trade in manufactures, and these in turn hardly talk to those who focus on the macroeconomics of debt and hyperinflation."
6913,承认无限异质性和无限制性在一个松散过程和无限复杂流的世界中的重要性，直接就与对后结构主义的指控联系在了一起。这种后结构主义是一种“随波逐流”的思考方式，认为道德或伦理原则没有什么特别用途。,"Affirming the importance of infinite heterogeneity and open-endedness in a world of unstructured processes and infinitely complex flows, directly connects to the charge against poststructuralism that it is an ""anything goes"" way of thinking within which no particular moral or ethical principles can carry any particular weight over any other."
6913,怀特(1991: 133)说：“在某种意义上，人们必须具有这种思想：应该抑制一些东西，而不是无原则地鼓励所有的他性的表现形式。,"""At some point,"" says White (1991: 133), ""one must have a way of arguing that not all manifestations of otherness should be fostered; some ought to be constrained."""
6913,”这假定了某种普遍的权利或正义原则。,And this presumes some general principles of right or justice.
6914,在现代主义往往追求的那种美学世界或可传达意义的世界中，不存在任何相互联系，甚至在同生产和交换的物质世界保持强大联系的背景中，情况也一样。,"There can be no interlinkage in the world of esthetics or of communicable meanings of the sort that modernism often sought, even in a context of strong interlinkage in the material world of production and exchange."
6914,从这一点出发，并不难理解，为什么后现代思想往往把海德格尔作为“解释性共同体”、碎片化的语言游戏等观点的先驱。,"From this standpoint, it is not hard to see how Heidegger figures so often in postmodern thinking as a precursor of ideas concerning the creation of ""interpretive communities,"" fragmented language games, and the like."
6914,也不难理解，后现代主义之粗俗的和商业的一面如何利用这些情感，把本土当成市场、模仿本真，并发明遗产、传统，甚至已经商业化的“根”。,"And it is not hard to see how the crass and commercial side of postmodernism could play upon these sentiments and market the vernacular, simulate the authentic and invent heritage, tradition, and even commercialized roots."
6915,同过去一样，现在参与研究的人们，通常也不知道研究将带来何种结果。,"As has happened in the past, some people who participate in studies and surveys today are often not appraised of the outcomes of the research findings."
6915,继而，就产生了互惠性这一问题。,"Subsequently, the issue of reciprocity has developed."
6915,这是解释社会学范式、批评理论和女性主义范式所关注的问题，但并不是所有范式都关注。,"This has certainly been an issue for interpretive social sciences, conflict theory and feminism paradigms, but has not always been the purveyance of all paradigms."
6915,如今，人们总是想从参与研究中得到点什么。,"In today's world, people want something back for participating in research."
6916,因此很明显，词汇不是中立的，而是具有很强的根本假设和含义的。,"Clearly,then,words are not neutral but have powerful underlying assumptions and meanings."
6916,这表明要理解支撑语言的话语，很重要的一点就是文化（culture)的分析。,This means that analysis of culture is crucial to understanding the language and discourse.
6916,后结构主义思想对城市社会地理学的影 响十分显著，这反映在分支学科明显的“文化转向”（‘culture turn’）之上。,"The effect of poststructuralist thinking on urban social geography has been substantial, to the point where the subdiscipline has taken a clear ‘cultural turn’."
6916,应当强调的是，这不是文化地理学中传统文化观念的转变，而是向文化作为一个具有共同意义的系统的人类学观点的转变。,"This, it should be emphasized, is not a turn toward the traditional notion of culture within cultural geography, but to the anthropological idea of cultures as systems of shared meanings."
6917,有些种族论者假定，各“种族”均被固定在一个不变的“天然”级序，这个级序就是从不同起点出发的截然不同的发育系列中当前的表现（多元发生论）。,"Some racial theorists assumed that different ‘races’ were fixed in an unchanging ‘natural’ hierarchy, the contemporary manifestation of quite distinct evolutionary sequences from different points of departure (polygenesis)."
6917,“外部”环境因素对这种先天的种族系统影响不大。,‘External’ environmental factors could have only limited impact on this preordained racial system.
6917,"这种论调预示着永远需要有一些在智力上和种族上优秀的帝国统治者的存在，以便管理殖民地那些不可救药的劣等人及其环境（Livingstone, 1992: 216-60）。","This argument presupposed the need for a permanent imperial presence of intellectually and racially superior rulers in order to manage the irredeemably inferior peoples and environments of the colonial world (Livingstone, 1992: 216–60)."
6918,"景观研究在1920年代由卡尔•索尔（Carl Sauer）介绍到美国地理学界，特别是通过他的“景观形态学”（The Morphology of Landscape, 1925[1963]）—文。","Landscape studies were introduced into American geography in the 1920s by Carl Sauer, especially with his ‘The Morphology of Landscape’ (1963 [1925])."
6918,受奥托•施吕特（Otto Schluter）等德国地理学家和景观学派影响的索尔，在他的时代里反对环境决定论，主张人类对自然景观的改变产生了他所称的“文化景观”（见第十五章关于索尔的工作在自然地理学中应用方式的分析）。,"Sauer, influenced by German geographers such as Otto Schluter and the Landschaft school, reacted against the environmental determinism of his day by arguing that it was collective human transformation of natural landscapes that produced what he called ‘cultural landscapes’."
6918,索尔对地理学家研究景观长达50多年（至少是在美国）的显著影响不容低估。,Sauer’s phenomenal influence on geographers’ study of landscape over five decades (in the USA at least) cannot be understated.
6919,另一派是区域论，也发端于经验主义传统中收集资料的意图……并且在某种程度上也是对环境决定论之过分的一种反动。,"The other approach - that of regionalism - sprang also from contemplation of the material collected in the empiricist tradition, and was to some extent also a reaction to the excesses of environmental determinism."
6919,地图的对照显示出某些现象的分布是重叠的，产生出地球表面的各种地方——区域。每一地方都有各种现象的特殊组合并造成独特的个性。,"Map comparison showed that certain distributions of phenomena overlapped, creating areas of the earths surface - regions - with particular combinations of characteristics and producing a unique identity for each area."
6920,在下文中，我将试图建立一种理论立场来理解一般所称的“环境问题”。,"In what follows I shall try to establish a theoretical position from which to try and make sense of what are generally called ""environmental issues."""
6920,藉此，我希望把这些问题与社会变迁以及“自然”和“环境”的评价方式联系起来。,"In so doing, I want to connect those issues to questions of social change and the way in which ""nature"" or ""environment"" is valued."
6920,我将试图说明：全部有关“环境”的提议都必然是社会变迁的提议，针对它们的行动总是需要用某种评价体制的“自然”来做具体的例证。,"I seek to show that all proposals concerning ""the environment"" are necessarily and simultaneously proposals for social change and that action on them always entails the instantiation in ""nature"" of a certain regime of values."
6921,但是，对自然的统治和对他者的统治之间的这种联系还有更多的维度。,But this connection between the domination of nature and the domination of others has a further dimension.
6921,任何种类的“改造自然”计划都具有分布性后果，许多此类明显不公正研究都是急烈冲突的根源。,"""Nature-transforming"" projects of any sort have distributional consequences and the patent inequity of many of these has been the source of powerful conflicts."
6921,当前，在环境正义运动和名为“穷人的环境保护主义” 运动的多国组织中，这些都成为斗争的焦点(参阅本书第十三章)。,"These are now the focus of struggle in the environmental justice movement and within a polyglot group of movements known as ""the environmentalism of the poor"" (see chapter 13)."
6922,在闹市区，缺少足够的首要混合用途通常是最严重的一个问题。,"In downtowns, lack of sufficient primary mixture is usually the most serious basic handicap."
6922,而在大多数的住宅区域，尤其是在灰色地带(gray areas)，缺少首要混合用途通常只是问题之一，有时候并不是最严重的。,"In most residential districts, and especially most gray areas, lack of primary mixture is usually only one handicap, and sometimes not the most severe."
6922,事实上，很容易就能找到住宅与工作融合的例子，但问题是这种融合并不能在生发多样性和活力方面给予多少帮助。,"Indeed, it is easy to find instances in which work is mixed with dwellings, yet to little avail in helping generate diversity or vigor."
6923,会议论文由两部分组成：口头发表部分和书面文本部分。,Conference papers are composed of two elements: a performance and a written text.
6923,口头发表部分是在作者发言过程中用来吸引听众的。,The performance is the element the audience will engage with at the time of the presentation.
6923,书面文本部分是供听众带走的或收录在会议论文集当中的。,The written text is the element they take away with them or have already read in the conference proceedings.
6923,切记勿将会议论文的这两个组成部分混为一谈，因为两者是截然不同的！,Ensure that you do not confuse the two elements of a conference presentation as being the same thing.They are not!
6923,书面文本部分包括你想让听众了解但由于时间限制而使你不能通过口头表述的全部研究内容。,The written text paper contains everything you want the audience to know about your research that you are unable to address within the time constraints of your oral presentation of the research.
6923,而口头发表的部分是以你研究中的一到两个亮点为主来激起听众的兴趣，使他们全神贯注投入到你的演讲中并且在演讲结束时提出问题。,The oral presentation focuses on one or two of the highlights of the research and stirs the audience's interest so that they will engage with you at the conclusion of the presentation and ask you questions.
6924,当然，从事经济学研究，或者是进行任何学术研究也一样，其实都是在绘制地图。,"Of course doing economics, or for that matter just about any kind of intellectual inquiry, is a kind of mapmaking."
6924,理论经济学家掌握的经济信息一部分是实实在在的数据，相当于装备有六分仪的探险家的工作结果，一部分是逸事趣闻，相当于旅行者讲述的传说。,"The economic theorist is in possession of information about the economy, some of it hard data, the equivalent of the work of men with sextants, some of it anecdotal, the equivalent of travelers' tales."
6924,理论经济学家试图借助这些可靠与不可靠的证据，加上事先的信念（不但证据不足的时候用它来补充，而且有时用它来驾驭显而易见的证据），来描绘一幅经济运行的图画。,"From this mixture of reliable and unreliable evidence, plus a priori beliefs that are used not only to fill in where evidence is lacking but also in some cases to overrule the apparent evidence, the theorist attempts to put together a picture of how the economy works."
6925,在整体归纳和假设演绎范式之间，也存在着混合研究方法。,Between the holistic-inductive and hypothetico-deductive paradigms lies the mixed method approach.
6925,混合研究方法在不同方面和程度上融合了定量与定性研究方法。,"The mixed method approach merges, in different ways and degrees, the methods used by quantitative and qualitative methodologies."
6925,所有这三种研究方法稍后都将进行细致深入的论述。,All three types of methodologies are discussed in further detail later in the chapter.
6926,最后，货币几乎不能作为一种恰当手段来再现人类需求、欲望、激情和价值的力量和复杂性，即便它能够把欲望从社会限制中解放出来。,"Money, lastly, hardly satisfies as an appropriate means to represent the strength or the manifold complexity of human wants, desires, passions, and values, even though it has the capacity to liberate desires from social constraints."
6926,“我们发现货币在实质上多少有点像卖淫”，席美尔(1978:377)如是说，马克思(1973)也同样这么认为。,"""We see in the nature of money itself something of the essence of prostitution,"" says Simmel (1978: 377) and Marx (1973) concurs."
6926,弗洛伊德想得更远，他也像我们习惯做法那样，把货币说成某种肮脏的和不洁的东西(“不义之财”、“卑鄙的富人”是常见的说法)。,"Freud took things even further, picking up on our penchant to describe money as something dirty and unclean (""filthy lucre"" and ""filthy rich"" are common expressions)."
6927,在同化过程中，由于产生了新的身份混合形式，主流文化和少数文化都发生了改变（第三章）。,Both mainstream and minority cultures are changed by assimilation through the creation of new hybrid forms of identity (Chapter 3).
6927,但是，总体而言，少数群体被同化的速度和程度依赖下列两组因素：（1)外部因素，包括特权群体的态度、制度性歧视和结构性作用等(2)群体内部的凝聚力。,"Nevertheless, in general, the rate and degree of assimilation of a minority group will depend on two sets of factors: (1) external factors, including charter group attitudes, institutional discrimination and structural effects, and (2) internal group cohesiveness."
6927,在少数群体和特权群体之间，上述这些因素不仅决定了它们之间冲突的特征和程度，而且决定了居住集聚和隔离的空间模式。,"Between them, these factors determine not only the degree and nature of conflict between minority groups and the charter group, but also the spatial patterns of residential congregation and segregation."
6928,通过将编码的数据组成频数分布，研究者得以使用集中趋势量数来进一步分析数据。,"Having organised the coded data into frequency distributions, the researcher is able to comment further on the data by using measures of central tendency."
6928,集中趋势量数能够使调查者以一个数字来报告结果（在此情况下指的是频数分布）。,Measures of central tendency are used to enable researchers to report on the results (in this case frequency distributions) as one number.
6928,集中趋势量数——众数、中位数和算术平均数——与具体的测量层次有关。,"The measures of central tendency — mode, median and mean — are associated with specific levels of measurement."
6929,研究者可能放弃使用编码簿或者计算机软件来帮助进行数据分析，这取决于调査本身的特点。,"Depending on your study, you may choose not to use code books or computer software to assist with your data analysis."
6929,如果调査的样本很小或者只有为数不多的几个问题，并且该研究的目的是描述性的，那么就可以选择此种方法。,"You may decide this if your sample is small, and/or you only have a limited number of questions, and the purpose of your study is descriptive."
6929,然而，在大多数的旅游研究中，情况并非如此。,"However, such a decision would usually not be the case in most tourism studies."
6929,如果觉得采用电脑分析不能有所保证，研究者就可以采用人工编码及输人作为一种更好的选择。,"Should you decide that engaging in computer analysis is not warranted, you may choose to use manual coding and entry as a better alternative."
6929,"在此情况下，研究者需要把数据输人记录单(参见表9-1),然后制定频数分布报告。","In this case, you would enter data into tally sheets (see table 9.1), which would then be developed into frequency distribution reports."
6930,不过，马克思预期“科学和技术将创造一个容易理解和可以操控的世界”，同时预期“只有资本主义关系才会妨碍”我们与自然的代谢关系之间合理调节。他的这些预期必然受到质疑。,"Nevertheless, Marx's expectation that ""science and technology would create an intelligible and controllable world as well as the expectation that only capitalist relations stand in the way of a rational regulation of our metabolism with nature, have to be questioned."
6930,这意味着对历史—地理唯物主义某些假设的挑战。,And this implies a challenge to some of the presumptions of historical–geographical materialism.
6931,路访基本上是在旅游过程的往返阶段开展的，这些调查能捕捉到旅游市场上最新的趋势（Hurst 1994)。,"En-route surveys are conducted during the travel experience, primarilythe travel-to phase or the return travel phase.These surveys enable trendsin travel markets to be kept up-to-date (Hurst 1994)."
6931,航空公司应用路访开展调查已达40年之久。,En-route surveyshave been used by airlines for some forty years.
6931,路访虽然成本低廉，但是并不适用于人口普查。,"They are cost-effective,but they do not achieve a census."
6931,路访的程序包括选择时间和地点（比如每5年在国际机场进行调查）、制订时间表、调查出境的乘客、天数和时段。,"The process involves selecting a placeand time, such as international airports every five years, as well as theschedules, outward-bound passengers, days and times."
6931,最后，要考虑参与者的个性特征——包括诸如性别、年龄和/或家庭生命周期等。,"Finally, consideration is given to the characteristics of the passengers who are to participate — selection may be by gender, age and/or family life cycle."
6932,任何研究都有可能在假设检验中出现错误。,"In any study, there is always a possibility of error being introduced in the testing of hypotheses."
6932,错误可分为一类错误和二类错误两种类型。,The errors may be described as one of two types — Type I or Type II .
6932,一类错误指零假设被证伪，而事实上该假设成立。,Type I errors occur when the null hypothesis is rejected when in fact it is true.
6932,二类错误指当零假设事实上不成立但却被证实。,Type II errors occur when the null hypothesis is accepted when in fact it is false.
6932,表9 - 8概括了假设检验中产生的错误类型。,Table 9.8 outlines the types of error that may arise in hypothesis testing.
6933,泽勒（Zeller 1991)认为定性研究报告并不是对“数据”而是对“情景”的报道——是研究者与其周围的被调査者的历时性交往的记录……他进一步质疑定性研究领域是否不同于散文、小说或来自于新周刊的生活片段式案例研究。,"Zeller (1991) suggests that qualitative studies don't report out 'data'; they report 'scenes' — that is accounts of researchers' engagements over time with informants in their surroundings....Zeller asks further whether qualitative field studies are different from the nonfictional novel, or from slice-of-life case studies from the New Journalism."
6933,定性研究有其独特的报道方式吗？,Do qualitative studies have a distinctive reporting style?
6933,……一组田野观察可以以不同的方式来诠释——以诗歌的形式或以连载短文或以戏剧或故事的形式。,... a set of field observations can be rendered differently — in poetic form . . . or as a series of vignettes ... or as scenes or stories.
6933,"社会科学报告与美学素材的“象征”或“修辞”文体之间的界限已经变得模糊（Miles & Huberman 1994, pp. 298-9) 。","A blurring of the frontiers seems to occur between social scientific reporting and 'figurative' or 'rhetorical' renditions of aesthetic material (Miles & Huberman 1994, pp. 298-9)."
6934,定量研究方法植根于实证主义社会科学范式。这一范式主要反映了自然科学的研究方法，且在研究过程中主要采用演绎法。,Quantitative research is grounded in the positivist social sciences paradigm that primarily reflects the scientific method of the natural sciences.Such a paradigm adopts a deductive approach to the research process.
6934,因此，就旅游研究而言，定量研究方法始于某一特定旅游现象的理论或假说，并通过对从现实世界中收集的信息进行分析，以支持或推翻该假说。,"As such, it commences with theories or hypotheses about a particular tourism phenomenon, gathers data from the real-world setting and then analyses the data to support or rejecthypotheses."
6935,结果产生了 “不同事务之不可比较的时空之间的复杂相互作用” ，而不是“由确定的历法框架所定义的同质性时空”。,"The effect is to generate a ""complex interplay of the incommensurable spacetimes of different transactions,"" rather than ""any homogeneous spacetime defined by determinate calendric frames."""
6935,但是，不可比较并不意味着没有联系。,But incommensurable does not mean unconnected.
6935,加瓦人的活动恰恰把一个时空和价值形态的领域同另一个领域联系在一起。,A lot of Gawan activity is precisely about linking one domain of space–time and value formation to another.
6936,出生日期抽样法：在这种方法中，抽样框是由参与者的出生日期构成，并采用和名称方法同样的程序进行样本单元的抽取，只是用出生日期代替了名称。,"Date of birth method: With this method, the sampling frame is constructed using participants ' date of birth and selection follows the same procedure as the name method, only birth dates are used instead."
6936,出生日期是随机抽取的，在抽样框中的那个日期的所有记录被确定为一个数字，接着用简单随机抽样程序(抽签方法、随机数表或电脑方法)抽取样本单位。,"A birth date is randomly selected, and all records for that date listed in the sampling frame are then assigned a number and the simple random sampling procedure (the lottery method, a table of random numbers or computer generation ) is repeated."
6936,同样，这个程序的选取也可能需要重复。,
6936,,"Again, there may be several iterations of this process."
6937,关于物理科学，很少有人反对为了研究复杂系统，必须建立简化模型的想法。,"When it comes to physical science, few people have problems with the idea that to study complex systems it is necessary to build simplified models."
6937,可是当我们讨论社会科学，整个建模的问题就会引起人们的不满。,"When we turn to social science, however, the whole issue of modeling begins to raise people's hackles."
6937,用一些简化（这个过程至少部分受已有技术的限制）的东西来代表相关系统的想法就一下子遭到强烈反对。,Suddenly the idea of representing the relevant system through a set of simplifications that are dictated at least in part by the available techniques becomes highly objectionable.
6938,建议是以研究结果、研究假设及研究目标和目的为基础的。,Recommendations are grounded in the research findings and the research hypotheses and/or aims and objectives.
6938,倘若建议被采纳，那么建议的执行首先就解释了实施该项研究的意义所在。,"If the recommendations are adopted, then the reason for the research being conducted in the first place should be solved by the implementation of the recommendations."
6938,建议应该包括一系列可供委托人选择的备选方案，影响建议选择的各种限制因素包括人才、资金及时间，等等。,"Recommendations should include a range of alternatives from which the client can choose, as personnel, monetary and time constraints may influence which recommendations are adopted and why."
6939,渐进法与持续比较分析十分相似，与草根理论分析所采用的开放式、轴心式和选择式编码等编码方法也十分相似（Neuman 2000)。,"Successive approximation is similar to constant comparative analysis.It is also similar to open, axial and selective coding (Neuman 2000), themethods of coding used in grounded theory analysis."
6939,根据纽曼(2000)的理论，研究人员能够通过如下方法对分析进行提炼：连续反复编码和分门别类；从假设性编码着手直到反复修改、检验作为概念、关系和“理论”出现的编码。,"According to Neuman (2000), the researcher is able to refine their analysis by successively repeating the coding and categorising processes; commencing with the first tentative codes through to the repeatedly modified and examined codes that emerge as concepts, relationships and 'theory'."
6939,"通过渐进法，“证据和理论得以相互影响”（Neuman 2000,p.427)。","Through successive approximation, 'the evidence and theory shape each other' (Neuman 2000, p. 427)."
6940,交叉表能够使调査者同时展现两个变量的信息，且能够判断两个变量之间是否相关。,Cross-tabulation enables the researcher to present information on two variables simultaneously and to determine whether any relationship exists between the two variables.
6940,这样的关系能用二元表格来求出，也就是说，二元表格能够使调查者采用交叉列表来表示两个变量。,"Such relationships can be determined using bivariate tables — that is, bivariate tables enable the researcher to crosstabulate two variables."
6940,任何测量层次的变量(定类、定序、定距和定比)都可以构造二元表格。,"Bivariate tables can be constructed with variables measured at any level (nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio)."
6940,"当制作二元表格时,通常自变量用列表示，因变量用行表示。","When preparing bivariate tables, the independent variable is presented in the columns and the dependent variable is presented in the rows."
6941,外部行车成本(External trip cost)等于交通拥挤的外部性的货币价值。,The external trip cost equals the monetary value of the congestion externality.
6941,假定行驶时间的机会成本为每分钟10美分。E栏数字就是在此基础上计算出的。,The figures in column E are based on the assumption that the opportunity cost of travel time is 10 cents per minute.
6942,"焦点群体法是一种集中的或半结构化的群体访谈(Minichiello, Aroni, Timewell& Alexander 1995)。","Focus groups may be described as focused or semi-structured group interviews (Minichiello, A r o n i , Timewell & Alexander 1995)."
6942,在这种调查过程中，研究对象的所有成员被同时采访，而不是逐个被采访。,"Instead of interviewing participants individually, study participants are interviewed together."
6942,焦点群体法通常在以下情况下采用：当采访者想要得到对于旅游相关概念的看法、意见和态度时，比如目的地形象、产品评价、关于主客关系的看法和价值取向以及当地居民对于旅游发展的看法和价值衡量。,"Focus groups are used when an interviewer wants to determine points of view, opinions and attitudes towards tourism-related concepts such as destination image, product testing, attitudes and values associated with host-guest interactions, and the attitudes and values of local residents to tourism developments."
6943,它的公园用地很少孩子们在街上玩耍。那儿没有超级街区(车辆禁行街区），甚至连像样一点的大街区(districts)也没有，有的只是非常小的街区;用规划的行话来说就是“支离破碎，街道浪费。,"It has little park-land.Children play in the streets.Instead of super-blocks, or even decently large blocks, it has very small blocks; in planning parlance it is ""badly cut up with wasteful streets."""
6943,”那儿的建筑都已老化。,Its buildings are old.
6943,所有的东西在北端都像是搁错了位置。,Everything conceivable is presumably wrong with the North End.
6944,结论可以分为第一结论和第二结论。,Conclusions may be described as first and second order conclusions.
6944,第一结论是统计性叙述，例如“79%的一日游游客对马蹄海湾的设施表示满意”。,"First order conclusions are statistical statements, such as '79% of daytrippers were satisfiedwith the facilities at Horseshoe Bay'."
6944,第二结论将统计性叙述或事实叙述与其他研究结论联系在一起，例如“79%的一日游游客对马蹄海湾的可利用设施感到满意，这要高于格林绍1996年报告中的数字：47%的一日游游客对马蹄海湾的可利用设备感到满意”。,"Second order conclusions link the statistical or factual statements to other research, such as 'While 79% of daytrippers were satisfied with the facilities available at Horseshoe Bay, this ishigher than the number identified by Grimshaw (1996), who reported that 47% of daytrippers were satisfied with the facilities available at Horseshoe Bay'."
6944,总体而言，结论部分对报告进行总结并对未来研究方向进行评论。,The conclusion section summarises the report and comments on future directions.
6945,"研究结果/成果部分所占篇幅最大（Sarantakos 1993, p. 428)。","The largest part of a report is the findings/results section (Sarantakos 1993, p. 428)."
6945,这一部分通常始于描述调查的回复率、无回复率及拒绝调查率，以此说明研究结果的代表性。,"This section usually commences with the response rates, non-response and refusals.The representativeness of the results is also affirmed."
6945,该部分对变量及其相互间的关系进行了描述。,This section includes a description of variables and their relationships.
6945,对结果的描述包括文字叙述、表格、图表及曲线图。,"The description of the results includes textual statements, tables, figures and graphs."
6945,通常在图表和曲线图前后要用简短的文字加以介绍。,Tables and graphs are introduced with brief sentences both before and after the tables and graphs are presented.
6945,该部分只描述研究成果和结果，而不对其进行分析、解释或讨论。,"This section only presents the results and findings — it does not analyse, interpret or discuss results."
6946,在揭示有关正义的主张时，后现代思想家们暗示，他们的工作服务于某个更加有效但却不确定的正义观念。,"In unmasking such claims about justice, postmodem thinkers imply that their work serves some more valid but unspecified notion of justice."
6946,人们在德里达有关“解构即正义”的主张中看到这一点，但也在他“人们既不能直接谈论正义也不能体验正义”的警告中看到这一点。,"One sees this in Derrida's declaration that ""Deconstruction is justice,"" but also in his cautioning that one can neither speak directly about nor experience justice."
6946,在回应对他者的责任感时，人们服从正义，不过却感到这项任务具有无限的、开放的特点。,"In answering the sense of responsibility to otherness, one serves justice but one does so with a sense of the infinite, open-ended character of the task."
6947,降雨的小变化能够使植被系统从一种状态转为另一种状态。,Small shifts of rainfall can move the vegetation system to one or another of them.
6947,当一个变化准备就绪，它就会转向一个稳定的状态。,"Once a change is set in train, it moves towards one of the stable states."
6947,"这种看法也支持了霍姆格伦和谢弗（Holmgren and Scheffer, 2001）的论点，即在管理植被覆盖的时候，可能最好等待降水的变化以创造朝向我们所希望的稳定状态的条件。","This also supports the arguments of Holmgren and Scheffer (2001) that, in managing the vegetation cover, it might be best to wait until the turns in rainfall create the conditions that will lead towards a new desired stable state."
6947,从第一点还可以理解，在植被对气候响应表现非线性性质的情况下，把地貌过程的变化（特别是土壤侵蚀）视为气候变化直接的线性结果的解释必须谨慎对待。,"It also follows that the interpretation of shifts in geomorphological process (notably soil erosion) as a direct, linear consequence of climate change needs to be treated with caution, given the non-linear nature of vegetation responses."
6948,在设计调查的过程中，首要的工作是识别研究目标或假设，然后确定试图研究的变量。,"In constructing surveys, first you need to be cognisant of your aims or hypotheses, and then you need to consider the variables you are attempting to study."
6948,"比如，在描述性调查中，研究者将验证描述性假设(Saramakos 1998, P.134)。","For example, in descriptive surveys, researchers are testing descriptive hypotheses (Sarantakos 1998, p. 134)."
6948,这样，在描述性假设中你要试图弄清楚“是谁”、“是什么”、“怎么样”的问题。,"Thus, in descriptive surveys, you want to determine the 'who', 'what' and 'how'."
6948,在前期的讨论中，会涉及年龄、性别、目的地和旅游的原因——这些是描述性定量研究的关键变量。,"In an earlier discussion, age, gender, destination and reason for travel were mentioned — these are key 'variables' in descriptive quantitative research."
6948,"在解释性调査中，研究者要验证相关性假设(Sarantakos 1998, p.134)并着手考虑因变量、自变量、外生变量和干涉变量。","In explanatory surveys, researchers are testing relational hypotheses (Sarantakos 1998, p. 134) and consideration of independent, dependent, extraneous and intervening variables needs to be undertaken by the researcher."
6949,一些门口会聚集大批人群的地方，如学校和剧院以及一些商店的门前可以增加一些行人过路的空间，这些空间会向车辆行驶的马路空间延伸，这样就会产生“限制”作用，而且这种作用会是长期的而不是短暂的。,"Spots of intense congregation outside schools,  some theaters, certain  store groupings, could be given outdoor lobbies intruding partially into the vehicular roadbed, thus making their attrition value permanent instead of ephemeral."
6949,一些小的公园可以横跨街道，这样就可以截断某些街道的车辆通行。,"Small parks could be carried across a street, thereby creating dead ends."
6949,当然，与此同时，也还允许车辆到达这个街道，但是除了紧急情况外，这些地方不应是直通街。,"These would still permit, from either direction, vehicular service access to a street.But they would prevent vehicular through traffic except in emergency."
6950,合成理论（compositional theory)是从芝加哥决定论派生出的另一学派之产物。,Compositional theory is the product of another school of thought that has developed out of the writings of the Chicago determinists.
6950,合成论者强调，不同社会群体的凝聚是基于民族、亲缘、邻居、职业或者生活方式，而这种社会网络并不 会被城市生活削弱。,"Compositionalists emphasize the cohesion and intimacy of distinctive social worlds based on ethnicity, kinship, neighbourhood, occupation or lifestyle, rejecting the idea that these social networks are in any way diminished by urban life (e.g."
6950,他们同时也认为，人类行为受城市生活的心理影响极小，它基本上是由经济地位、文化特征和家庭地位等决定的，而这些因素也决定了人们从属于哪个社会群体。,"Gans, 1962).They also minimize the psychological effects of city life on people’s behaviour, suggesting, instead, that behaviour is determined largely by economic status, cultural characteristics, family status and so on: the same attributes that determine which social worlds they live in."
6951,这就意味着，应该用一套更加系统的政治、制度安排以及调控实践来取代专门的、分裂的，及官僚的国家调控方法。,"This means that the ad hoc, fragmented and bureaucratic approach to state regulation should be replaced by a far more systematic set of politics, institutional arrangements, and regulatory practices."
6951,不能指望未来对自己负责，有必要设计从长远看来对可持续经济增长和经济发展来说是好的策略，这种说法有道理。,"The future, it is argued, cannot be expected to look after itself and some sorts of calculations are necessary to configure what would be a good strategy for sustainable economic growth and economic development in the long run."
6951,这个表达的关键词是“可持续性” 。,"The key word in this formulation is ""sustainability."""
6952,第一个例子来自社会性之流中全部“环节” 中最困难的，即有关人类信仰、欲望、幻想、恐惧、梦和价值等领域的环节。,"The first case is drawn from that most difficult of all ""moments"" in the flow of sociality: that which concerns the realms of human belief, desires, fantasies, fears, dreams, and values."
6952,弗洛伊德以来，这已经成为精神分析的主要领域。,"Since Freud, this has become the privileged terrain of psychoanalysis."
6952,精神分析对欲望及其实现/否定/压抑的理解现在常常作为一种不可还原的“自由”要素占据着优先地位，因此成为“真正的”变革地点。,"A psychoanalytic understanding of desire and its realization/denial/repression is now frequently privileged as an irreducible ""moment"" of freedom and as, therefore, the ""true"" locus of change."
6953,不过，地方之间的竞争不只是吸引生产的问题。,"Inter-place competition is not simply about attracting production, however."
6953,它也是吸引消费者(特别是那些富人)的问题，为此它创造了诸如文化中心、惬意的城市或地区风景等等这些令人愉快的设施。,"It is also about attracting consumers (particularly the affluent) through the creation of amenities such as a cultural center, a pleasing urban or regional landscape, and the like."
6953,对消费景观进行投资、出售地方形象、争夺文化和象征资本的定义、恢复作为消费吸引力的同地方有关的本国传统等等，所有这些都成为地方间竞争的一个部分。,"Investment in consumption spectacles, the selling of images of places, competition over the definition of cultural and symbolic capital, the revival of vernacular traditions associated with places as a consumer attraction, all become conflated in inter-place competition."
6954,文化理论学家因此强调身体特征的不稳定的和可塑的特征。,Cultural theorists stress the unstable and malleable character of bodily identities.
6954,性别、性取向、文化以及人们之间的其他自然差异并不是自然存在的，而是与特定空间相联系的“文化表现”。,"Gender, sexuality, cultural and other physical differences between people are not natural entities but ‘cultural performances’ related to particular spaces."
6954,这种过程被称之为“具化”（‘embodiment’），身体由此而在更广泛意义体系中被社会化构造。,The processes through which the body is socially constructed in spaces by wider systems of meaning is also known as embodiment.
6955,"现代地理学家的工作不像人本主义地理学家那样赞美人类的创造力与个人特性，他们致力于更苛刻地从质疑政治身份与政治交叉点两方面研究身份问题（Rose, 1995）。","Unlike humanistic geographical work that celebrated human creativity, agency and individuality, other geographical work has engaged more critically with questions of identity by interrogating both the politics of identity and the political intersections of place and identity (Rose, 1995)."
6955,"此类工作中最近的重要主题是以具体化语言对身份有所了解和进行解释（Butler, 1999; McDowell, 1999; Longhurst, 2000; Valentine, 2001）。","An important theme within such work has been to understand and interpret identities in embodied terms (Butler, 1999; McDowell, 1999; Longhurst, 2000; Valentine, 2001)."
6955,具体化的概念，不仅对身份的研究，而且更广泛地对知识的增进也具有重要意义。,Ideas about embodiment have important implications not only for studying identity but also for the production of knowledge more widely.
6956,事实上，城市并不是模型中的核心概念。,"Indeed, cities are not primitive concepts in the model."
6956,相反，单个厂商生产能力的规模报酬递增，运输成本和要素流动性等因素之间的相互作用导致了聚集现像的出现。,"Instead, agglomerations emerge from the interaction between increasing returns at the level of the individual production facility transportation costs, and factor mobility."
6956,由于规模报酬递增，每一种产品在有限几处集中生产更有利。,"Because of increasing returns, it is advantageous to concentrate production of each good at a few locations."
6957,相形之下，在自然地理学范围内，距离的概念仍然是强烈的绝对空间、以欧氏几何术语定义的空间、米制的空间。,"In comparison, within physical geography, concepts of distance have remained strongly absolute and defined in terms of Euclidean and metric space."
6957,也许我们本应指望一贯强调绝对空间的自然地理学家接受这项挑战，更侧重于空间分析。,"Perhaps physical geographers, with their ongoing emphasis on absolute space, could have been expected to take up the challenge and to focus more on spatial analysis."
6957,但是，他们一般都选择反对这种途径，贬低或无视空间分析。,"However, they have generally also chosen to reject this pathway and downgrade or neglect spatial analysis."
6958,以上问题都是封闭式的，因为答案已经事先规定好了。,"The above response sets are described as closed, because the answers have been predeter mined."
6958,另外一种类型的问题是开放式问题，它在问卷上留出空白空间或给予受访者足够时间完成问卷。,"Another type of question is the open-ended question, and it is posed with space on the questionnaire or sufficient time for the respondent to reply."
6958,开放式问题可能要采用第三章描述的内容分析法进行分析，否则回答将可能简化为分类以及数字化的编码和分析。,"The open-ended question might be analysed using content analysis procedures described in chapter 3, or the responses might be reduced to categories and numerically coded and analysed."
6959,这些可憎的思想反映了一种占优势的正统，但同时也激起了热烈的辩论。,Such distasteful ideas reflected a prevailing orthodoxy but they also provoked spirited debate.
6959,尽管环境决定论和科学种族主义常常互相强化，但也可能互相矛盾。,"While environmental determinism and scientific racism  were often mutually reinforcing ideas, they could also contradict one another."
6959,有些种族论者假定，各“种族”均被固定在一个不变的“天然”级序，这个级序就是从不同起点出发的截然不同的发育系列中当前的表现(多元发生论)。,"Some racial theorists assumed that different ‘races’ were fixed in an unchanging ‘natural’ hierarchy, the contemporary manifestation of quite distinct evolutionary sequences from different points of departure (polygenesis)."
6960,时间理解上的对立是显而易见的(参阅本书第七章)。,The opposition in the sense of time is obvious (see chapter 7).
6960,如果实践是资本主义性质的，那么时间范围就不可能是环境主义者坚持的那种。,"If the practices are capitalistic, then the time horizon cannot be that to which environmentalists cleave."
6960,可持续性修辞的目标在于使公共政策考虑市场之外的时间范围。,The purpose of the rhetoric of sustainability is to direct public policy towards thinking about time horizons well beyond those encountered in the market.
6961,但是，莱布尼茨关心上帝的创造性和完美性。,But Leibniz is concerned with God's creativity and perfection.
6961,他认为，牛顿把上帝置于时间和空间中，就好像上帝的行为是前定的，或者甚至好像时空的属性先于上帝。,He thought that the Newtonian view placed God in space and time as if either God's actions were predetermined or even as if the properties of space and time preceded God.
6961,承认多种可能世界(每一个世界都具有自己的运动法则)中的时空多元性，就是承认，我们占据的物理世界是上帝的创造性选择和意志的表现。,The discussion of a plurality of spaces and times within multiple possible worlds (each with its own laws of motion) recognizes that the physical world we occupy is an expression of God's creative choice and will.
6961,对莱布尼茨来说，上帝的完美性产生了“所有可能世界中最好的”。,"For Leibniz, God's perfection delivers ""the best of all possible worlds?"
6961,对相当不同的时间和空间之可能秩序进行探究是要阐明上帝选择的特殊性质。,The exploration of quite different possible orderings of space and time is meant to illuminate the particular qualities of God's choice.
6962,"克里格法能够帮助识别出哪些尺度其过程是重要的,不同的现象是怎样在空间中显示出连贯性的。",Kriging helps identify the scales over which certain processes remain important and how different phenomena show continuity in space.
6962,"这些方法大大改进了传统的制图技术——过去,当遇到空间中分散的观测物时,需要综合运用知识、判断和纯粹的猜测在图上画出等值线。现代的地统计学方法使得插值法的运用更为精确。","Such methods provide a real improvement on traditional mapping techniques – in the old days, when faced with a scatter of observations in space, one used a mixture of knowledge, judgment and pure guesswork to draw the isolines on a map."
6963,显然，如果按照实证主义范式进行研究，那么在研究过程中是不应该出现这种互惠性，因为实证主义者认为这种互惠性改变了研究过程的客观本质。,"Obviously, such involvement on the part of the researcher in the research process would not be condoned by researchers operating from a positivist paradigm, as this type of reciprocity would be considered to alter the objective nature of the research process."
6963,从实证主义的观点看，这种指责是正确的。,And such an accusation would be correct from a positivist viewpoint.
6963,然而，从解释社会学范式、批评理论、后结构主义/后现代主义，特别是从女性主义范式的视角来看，这种所谓的客观性与现实的社会结构是对立的。,"However, from the interpretive social sciences, critical theory, poststructuralist/postmodern and especially feminist perspectives, such objectivity is the antithesis of the social construction of reality."
6964,在人类身体上发挥作用的过程正在变化，并且人类身体的细微差别如其同质化那样显著。,The processes at work on the human body are changing and the differentiation of human bodies is as marked as its homogenization.
6964,因此，我们的“万物尺度”自身是不稳定的且相互冲突的。,"As a consequence, our ""measure of all things"" is itself unstable and conflictual."
6964,它总是如此。,It has always been so.
6965,20世纪之初掀起了一场关于“大国”前途的充满焦虑的辩论。,The onset of the twentieth century provoked a rather anxious debate about the future of the ‘great powers’.
6965,许多人认为1900年标志着世界历史的转折点，是欧洲持续扩张400年的终结。,"Many believed that 1900 would mark a turning point in world history, the end of a 400-year period of continuous European expansion."
6965,世界地图上未探查过和未被认领的“空白”空间在迅速减少，或者看来是如此，“世界封闭”之意呼之欲出。,"The unexplored and unclaimed ‘blank’ spaces on the world map were rapidly diminishing, or so it seemed, and the sense of a ‘global closure’ was palpable."
6966,最近几年，人们提出了这样一种与众不同但却相当普及的主张：“空间”规定了差异、他性、没有管束、不可预见、意外等等领域，因此也规定作用地点和解放政治支点。,"In recent years, the extraordinary, but now quite widespread claim, has been advanced that ""space"" defines the realm of difference, of otherness, the uncontrolled, the unpredictable, the unexpected, and, hence, the locus of agency and the leveraging point for emancipatory politics."
6966,空间为全部有关社会过程的元理论规定了不可驯服的残余。,Space defines the untamable residual to all metatheories of the social process.
6966,这些非常强烈的主张值得我们批判性详察。,These are very strong claims that deserve critical scrutiny.
6966,它们预示了这个问题，如何理解有关行动和社会决定问题的差异地理学和理论化的空间性。,"They presage the question of how to understand the geography of difference, the spatiality of theorizations, in relation to the issues of agency and social determination."
6967,空间障碍的消除和“通过时间消灭空间”的斗争对于全部资本积累的动态来说都是根本性的，并且在资本过度积累危机时期更是剧烈。,"The elimination of spatial barriers and the struggle to ""annihilate space by time"" is essential to the whole dynamic of capital accumulation and becomes particularly acute in crises of capital overaccumulation."
6967,通过向新领域的地理扩张以及建构全新的空间关系来吸收剩余资本(有时是剩余劳动力)可以说是很显著的。,The absorption of surpluses of capital (and sometimes labor) through geographical expansion into new territories and through the construction of a completely new set of space relations has been nothing short of remarkable.
6967,如列斐伏尔(Henri Lefebvre，1974)敏锐地指出的那样，空间关系以及全球空间体制的建构和重构是资本主义残存到20世纪的主要手段之一。,"The construction and reconstruction of space relations and of the global space economy, as Henri Lefebvre (1974) acutely observes, has been one of the main means to permit the survival of capitalism into the twentieth century."
6968,“正在变成”的概念和对形成尺度的政治关注是唯物主义者全球性尺度论点的核心。,The notion of ‘becoming’ and the focus on the politics of producing scales have been central to materialist arguments concerning the global scale.
6968,因此，他们把很多注意力都投在了研究跨国公司是如何“走向全球化”的，管理制度是如何“变成”超越国界的，工会是如何谋求其运作的“全球化”以适应日益“全球化”的资本运作。,"Thus, there has been much attention paid to how transnational corporations have ‘gone global’, how institutions of governance have ‘become’ supranational and how labour unions have sought to ‘globalize’ their operations to match those of an increasingly ‘globalized’ capital."
6968,在这种方法中，不能设想把社会行动主体和过程在其中运作的各种尺度同造就了这些尺度的行动主体与过程割裂开来。,"In such an approach, the various scales at which social actors and processes operate cannot be conceived of as separate from the actors and processes that create them."
6969,雷坡（1989）指出，有必要建立本学科的核心基础。,Leiper (1989) suggests there is a need for the establishment of a central ground.
6969,该基础应建立在跨学科研究方法之上，因为利用多学科的研究方法而非跨学科的研究方法对旅游学的学科发展是无益的。,"This ground should be interdisciplinary based, as the use of a multidisciplinary approach rather than an interdisciplinary approach is counterproductive to the development of a tourism discipline."
6969,多学科的研究方法是零散片面的，由此所得出结论也是孤立分散的。,A multidisciplinary approach is fragmented with unconnected findings.
6970,对一个城市的地区或街道来说，老建筑的惟一危害最终会来自建筑的老化——这种危害存在于任何年代久远的东西，任何衰老的东西里。,The only harm for aged buildings to a city district or street is the harm that eventually comes of nothing but old age --- the harm that lies in everything being old and everything becoming worn out.
6970,"但是，对于处在这种情况下的城市某个地区来说，并不是因为这个地方年代久了,就会遭遇失败。",But a city area in such a situation is not a failure because of being all old.
6970,情况恰恰相反，这个地区变得又老又旧，是因为这个地方遭遇了失败。,It is the other way around.The area is all old because it is a failure.
6971,围绕这些项目设计问题，并准备五种答案，如：非常赞同、赞同、不确定、不赞同、非常反对。,"Statements using those items are then prepared with a five-point response set using, for example, strongly agree, agree, undecided, disagree, strongly disagree."
6971,再就这些问题开展实验性的前测，以确保所列问题的单一尺度性和内部一致性（Samntakos 1998）。,A pilot test of the statements is then constructed to determine their unidimensionality and their internal consistency (Sarantakos 1998).
6971,具有以上两种特性的问题才能用于构成问卷。,Those statements with unidimensionality and internal consistency are used in the construction of the questionnaire.
6971,以下的行业透视给出了李克特量表的使用实例。,The following Industry Insight demonstrates the use of a Likert scale.
6972,采用定性方法进行数据收集和分析的一个关键原则就是：“如果我们确实要理解人们的想法，必须基于他们的观念对其经历进行完整分析，而非基于我们的观念”（Boas 1943，p.314)。,"The key principle of a qualitative approach to data collection and analysis is that  it is our serious purpose to understand the thoughts of a people, the whole analysis of experience must be based on their concepts, not ours' (Boas 1943, p. 314)."
6972,这要通过“理解”（Weber 1978） —移情式理解来达到（参见第二章）。,"This is achieved through 'verstehen' (Weber 1978) — that is, empathetic understanding (see chapter 2)."
6972,在研究设计中，指导定性方法论运用的理论范式非常之多。,There are a number of theoretical positions that inform the use of a qualitative methodological framework in research design.
6973,马克斯•韦伯的著作率先在定性数据分析中使用了理想型法（Neuman 2000，p.431)。,"The use of ideal types in qualitative data analysis is founded in the work of Max Weber (Neuman 2000, p. 431)."
6973,“理想型就是社会关系或发展过程的模型或心理抽象。,‘Ideal types are models or mental abstractions of social relations or processes.
6973,它们是纯粹的标准，以此作为数据或‘事实’的参照标准。理想型是进行比较的工具，因为没有任何事实会完全符合理想型”（Neuman 2000，p.431)。,"They are pure standards against which the data or ""reality"" can be compared.An ideal type is a device used for comparison, because no reality ever fits an ideal type' (Neuman 2000, p. 431)."
6974,历时研究是指对同一或相似样本在一定时间段内进行研究。,Longitudinal studies involve the study of the same people or a similar sample of people over a set period of time.
6974,这种研究的数据 可能通过访谈、焦点群体法、参与观察法和文献法（在本章后面进行解释）得到。,"Data may be collected using interviews, focus groups, participant observation and the documentary method (explained later in the chapter)."
6974,历时研究也可用于定量方法，但因为本章关注的是定性研究方法，因此只讨论有关整体-归纳范式（holistic-inductive paradigm）的方法。,"Longitudinal studies may also be conducted using quantitative methods; however, as this chapter focuses on qualitative methods, only those methods associated with a holistic-inductive paradigm are discussed."
6975,联合主题发言是由几个从事相同或相似研究的研究者一起讨论他们的研究成果。,Panel sessions involve a group of researchers from the same research project or similar research projects discussing their research findings.
6975,在这种发言中，研究课题展示了不同的视角，听众人数要比个人发言多，而且互动的效果也更充分。,Different perspectives on the overall research topic should be elicited from such discussions and audience engagement and interaction should be higher than during a stand-up presentation.
6975,这种联合发言通常持续一个小时到一个半小时，其间会有热烈的讨论。,Panel sessions usually are allocated one to one-and-a-half hours to allow time for 'lively' debate.
6976,但是，把笛卡儿的和辩证法的概念看成在各个方面都不相容，如卡普拉(1982)以及某种程度上莱文斯和莱温廷(1985)所做的那样，也是不对的。,"But it would be wrong to view Cartesian and dialectical conceptions as fundamentally incompatible in all senses, as someone like Capra (1982) and to some degree Levins and Lewontin (1985) tend to do."
6976,只要再从互补性角度来考察，他们就能为新观点提供丰富的资源。,Cast in a more complementary light they can provide a fecund source of new ideas.
6976,在理论物理学中，19世纪被视为完全不可通约的命题——“物质在其本质上是由粒子组成的，或者是由波组成的”——最终在量子理论中被看作是一个整体。,"In theoretical physics what were seen in the nineteenth century as radically incommensurable propositions ""that matter is in its essence of a particle nature, or that it is of a wave nature,"" were ultimately treated as a unity under the conception in quantum theory."
6977,零假设（Ho）——零假设是一种假定检验的变量间无关联的假设。,Null hypothesis (Ho) — the null hypothesis is a hypothesis that assumes that there is no relationship between the variables being tested for relationships.
6977,备择假设——备择假设与零假设是对立的。,The alternate hypothesis — the alternate hypothesis states the opposite of the null hypothesis.
6977,有许多用于备择假设的术语，例如研究假设或实验性假设（H1）。,"There are a number of other terms that are used for the alternate hypothesis, such as the research hypothesis or the experimental hypothesis ( H1) ."
6978,领土性概念的多数地理学应用，一直基于一种与动物行为的一般类比，而不是作为现象学研究的结果。,Most of the geographical use of the concept of territoriality has been based on a general analogy with animal behaviour rather than as the outcome of phenomenological research.
6978,"（参见：Tuan，1976, 论群集。）","(Though see Tuan, 1976, on crowding.)"
6979,按照这种观点，领土界定既表现为同一物种不同成员之间的竞争，又表现为他们的相互合作。,"Territorial stakeouts, according to this account, are as much about mutual cooperation between members of a species as about competition."
6979,实际上，竞争与合作之间是一种辩证关系，在某种条件下，竞争能够成为合作，反之亦然。,"Indeed, the distinction between competition and cooperation collapses into a dialectical relation in which one can become the other and vice versa under certain conditions."
6979,英格尔德指出，排他性领土状态只是一种稳定的和排他的财产权功能，这样的权利是社会的产物而非自然所固有的。,"Exclusionary territoriality, Ingold points out, is solely a function of property rights of a settled and exclusionary sort and such rights are a product of society not inherent in nature."
6980,但是这些研究和其他研究表明，流散的身份并没有因空间和时间而均质化。,"But as these works and others make clear, diasporic identities are not homogenized across space and time."
6980,相反，他们因地点的特殊性以及不同区位、不同尺度的社会生产和再生产关系不均衡地发挥作用的方式而被改变。,"Rather, they are altered by particularities of place and the unevenness of the ways the social relations of production and reproduction are played out in different locations and at different scales."
6980,换句话说，相对于早期的认为身份固定地植根于其本质的观点，虽然说空间性带来了某种流动性的概念和身份因社会构建而成的意义，但它也使得身份无限可变的观念成为不可能。,"In other words, if spatiality confers a certain notion of fluidity and the social constructedness of identity against earlier ideas of fixed identity rooted in a given essence, it also makes impossible notions of identity as infinitely malleable."
6981,相反，微观研究是抽象的和理论的，包括小样本和寻求查明宏观研究所揭示的产生这种格局背后的因果机制。,"Intensive research, by contrast, is abstract and theoretical, involves small samples, and seeks to uncover the underlying causal mechanisms that generate the patterns revealed by extensive investigation."
6981,随机性抽样的住户问卷和对关键答卷者的半组织性访谈就是对这两个要素的简明例子。,One simple illustration of these two elements is the randomly-sampled household questionnaire and the semi-structured interview with key respondents.
6981,另一种例子是对小集水区排水中溶质浓度的监测，结合对山坡土壤间隙水中矿物质稳定场的分析，借以解释坡地排水化学的变化。,"Another is the systematic monitoring of solute concentrations in the discharge of water from a small catchment, combined with analysis of the mineral stability fields for interstitial water in the hillslope soils in order to explain variation in the slope drainage water chemistry."
6982,路访基本上是在旅游过程的往返阶段开展的，这些调查能捕捉到旅游市场上最新的趋势（Hurst 1994)。,"En-route surveys are conducted during the travel experience, primarilythe travel-to phase or the return travel phase.These surveys enable trends in travel markets to be kept up-to-date (Hurst 1994)."
6982,航空公司应用路访开展调查已达40年之久。,En-route surveys have been used by airlines for some forty years.
6982,路访虽然成本低廉，但是并不适用于人口普查。,"They are cost-effective, but they do not achieve a census."
6983,在旅游文献中，很多理论方法被用于研究旅游动机。,"Within tourism literature, a variety of theoretical approaches has been used to study travel motivations."
6983,这些方法大体上可以分为四类：准（社会）心理学理论、心理曲线图、内在动机理论和社会人口统计及经济背景分析。,These approaches may be broadly classified into four groupings: quasi-(socio)-psychological theories; psychographic profiles; intrinsic motivation theories; and socio- demographic and economic profiles.
6983,对旅游动机研究的批判主要针对他们的一维测定法、后续一维原因分析法以及最主要的出位的（局外人的）视角。,"The main criticisms of travel motivation studies relate to their unidimensional approach and subsequent unicausal analysis, as well as their predominantiy etic (outsider's) perspectives."
6984,准备研究计划时还需要了解目标读者。,"When preparing a research proposal, you need to be aware of your audience."
6984,读者可能是普通大众、旅游组织/协会、政府机关、商业管理者、其他研究者或学者。,"The audience may be the general public, tourism organisations and associations, government agencies, business managers, other researchers or academics."
6984,不同的读者对写作形式有不同的要求（语调、音调、语气和风格）。,"Each audience will require a specific style of writing (tone, tenor, mode and genre)."
6985,预测调査法根据过去和现在的数据推断未来的类型和趋势。比如：沃加沃加（Wagga Wagga）本地居民对整个地区旅游吸引物了解愈多，则本地居民以及拜访他们的朋友、亲属到访这些吸引物的次数就愈多。,"Predictive surveys make extrapolations about future patterns and trends based on past and current data sets, for example the more Wagga Wagga residents know about regional tourist attractions, the greater the number of those attractions visited by the locals and their visiting friends and relatives."
6985,估值调查法通过旧战略和新战略对比，以确定新战略的效果。,Evaluative surveys compare past strategies against newly implemented strategies to determine their effectiveness.
6986,实际上，许多旅游研究都属于应用性研究，但是，这并没有弱化纯理论研究的作用。,"Essentially, most tourism research is located in the applied research field; however, that is not to downplay the role of pure research."
6986,正如上面提到的，纯理论研究才是旅游学或与旅游学相关的基础理论的基本来源。,"As noted above, it is from pure research that the theories we use in tourism or tourism-related disciplines are primarily derived."
6986,应用性研究是用来收集与某些问题、论题或规划有关的信息的一般性研究。,"Applied research is generally research that is designed to gather information relating to a problem, issue or planning need."
6987,例如，1999年，在邻国一个为人熟知的海岸旅游目的地，游客们遭遇到了那些貌似旅游研究者的轮番轰炸。他们不停地询问有关该旅游区域的各个角落甚至是附近街道的各种问题。,"For example, during 1999, in a particularly popular coastal tourism location in a neighbouring country, tourists were bombarded by supposed tourism researchers on what seemed like every corner of the main precinct and into neighbouring streets."
6987,为了得到足够多的资料，很多的竞争“研究团队”轮番询问，结果导致每个旅游者回答了无数的问题，甚至每走半公里就被三四个“研究者”拦住询问，为此他们变得愤怒、恼火、粗鲁，最终不得不放弃进人主景区。,"The intensity of the data gathering by competing 'research teams' was so great that tourists were receiving multiple requests for participation in research and, as a consequence, were becoming aggressive, angry, rude and were choosing not to enter the precinct since in the course of walking half a kilometre they were being intercepted by at least three if not four 'researchers'."
6987,这些研究者的行为给景区的经营者带来的后果是——他们丧失了游客。,The action of these researchers had ramifications for tourism operators in the precinct — they were losing customers.
6988,第二个就是行动问题。,
6988,,"Secondly, there is the related problem of agency."
6988,由于不再把工人阶级当作当代历史当事人，法兰克福学派在寻求替代性的行动地点时就存在着困难。,"Having laid aside the working class as the agent of contemporary history, the Frankfurt School had difficulty in finding an alternative locus of action."
6988,固然，有几个人发现了某种替代，如马尔库塞信任(由爱欲武装起来的)青年造反派，哈贝马斯在新社会运动中致力于建构一种交往行动的伦理学。,"To be sure, several of them found some sort of alternative — Marcuse put his faith in youthful rebellion (powered by Eros) and Habermas in new social movements dedicated to the construction of an ethics of communicative action."
6989,澳大利亚社会学协会和奥特亚罗瓦社会学协会的伦理准则发展而来。,The Code of Ethics of the Australian and New Zealand Association for Leisure Studies (ANZALS) (see appendix 5) was developed from the Australian Sociological Association and the Sociological Association of Aotearoa.
6989,这些原则的目的是要涵盖在教学和研究中的伦理问题，同时也要包含与职业操守和出版伦理相关的一些准则。,The code aims to cover ethical issues in teaching and research as well as ethical issues associated with professional behaviour and the role of ethics in publications.
6989,这些原则对伦理问题进行了阐述，是有关研究参与者、研究契约的执行、教学研究的伦理责任的具体方针。,"The code posits an ethical statement, which is followed by specific guidelines regarding ethical responsibilities to research participants, the conduct of contractual research, teaching and student research."
6990,旅游研究者不仅属于旅游接待业研究领域，它还属于一个包括更多学科的科学领域。,The tourism researcher belongs not only to the tourism and hospitalityresearch community but also to the larger scientific community comprising all disciplinary areas.
6990,作为这两个团体的成员，旅游研究者有义务遵循研究的伦理规范。,"As a member of both communities, the tourism researcher is obliged to follow rules for the ethical conduct of research."
6990,"任何与伦理原则相冲突的行为不仅会影响研究者本人，对整个组织成员的声誉也将造成很大的影响。因此，为了确保所有的研究者都按照伦理的原则行事,各个不同的学科领域也已构建了自己的伦理准则。","Any misconduct in relation to the rules of ethical conduct affects not only the individual tourism researcher but also the reputation of all members of the wider scientific community, in order to ensure that all researchers act in an ethical manner, various disciplinary areas have developed their own codes of ethics."
6991,逻辑整理：这种类型的整理是与不遵循“如果——那么”框架/情节的答案的记录相关的(Babbie 1995)。,Contingency cleaningThis type of cleaning relates to the recording of responses that do not follow'if-then' scenarios (Babbie 1995).
6991,巴比提供了一个例子:一个受访者被问及他们生了多少个孩子，如果一些男性登录了许多孩子，这就暗示着输入的错误。,"Babbie provides the example that an interviewee may be asked how many children they have given birth to.If any men have recorded a number of children, this indicates an error in entry."
6991,“如果——那么”框架的想法就是“如果你是一个女人，那么你才有潜能生孩子”。,"The 'if- then' scenario is ' if you are a woman, then you have the potential to givebirth to a child'."
6992,当研究者想研究一个地理区域上的组群时，就使用这种研究方法。,This method of sampling is used when researchers want to study clusters in geographical areas.
6992,举一个例子，假设我们研究居民对在特鲁安(Tourville)城建设赌场或度假地的态度。,"As an example, assume another hypothetical study — the study of residents' attitudes to the development of a casino/resort in the city Tourville."
6992,研究设计是使用随机抽样对成年居民进行面对面的访问。,The research design involves a face-to-face interview with adult residents using random sampling.
6992,鉴于特鲁安城有1 000万人口，不能对所有的居民进行研究，所以我们必须进行抽样。,"Since Tourville has a population of one million , not all residents can be included, so a sample must be undertaken."
6993,但是这种形象化的、男性的和工人阶级的民族特性也有赖于女性的专心于家务。,"But in this image such an embodied, masculine and working-class national identity also depends on feminized domesticity."
6993,画面上男人和他的妻儿站在一起，通过门槛可以看到整洁有序的家。,"The man is pictured with his wife and child, and the viewer can look into the tidy and well-ordered home beyond the threshold."
6993,当男人从家中凝视远方并无视其妻子与观赏者的凝视时，他的妻子充满爱意地仰望着他。,"While the man gazes into the distance away from home and beyond the gaze of both his wife and the viewer, his wife looks up at him lovingly."
6994,案例研究法有时会与民族志或参与观察法相混淆（Yin 1994)。它们其实是不同的。,Case studies are sometimes confused with ethnography or participant observation (Yin 1994).
6994,,"However, they are not the same."
6994,实际上，案例研究可以综合运用参与观察法和民族志来收集某个案例或系列案例的数据。,"In fact, case studies incorporate the use of pardcipant observation and ethnography as part of the repertoire of methods that may be used to gather data on a specific case or set of cases."
6995,美国的“明智利用” 运动根源于一个长期的传统：反对联邦政府管制私有财产的权力。,The “wise use” movement in the United States has its roots in a long tradition of opposition to the powers of the federal government to regulate private property.
6995,西部养牛场利益集团反对联邦政府控制美国西部大片土地而发动的所谓“sage-brush叛乱”只是那段历史中的一个事件。,"The so-called ""sage-brush rebellion"" of western cattle-ranching interests against federal control over extensive tracts of land in the US west was just one incident in that history."
6995,它诉诸大众常识，有效地利用有影响力的个人不公正传闻，他们深受政府管控之苦。,It appeals to popular common sense and makes effective use of powerful anecdotes of personal injustice on the part of individuals caught in the regulatory thickets of government action.
6996,在这次讲座的前面部分，我们讨论了大推进模型，这个例子已经证明反映超发展理论精髓的模型并不需要非常复杂。,The example of the Big Push model discussed earlier in this lecture shows that models in the spirit of high development theory need not be very complicated.
6996,但无论怎样它们必须处理市场结构的问题。,"They must, however, deal somehow with the problem of market structure."
6996,这实质上意味着我们需要做出一些特殊的假设，来利用产业组织理论家在20世纪70年代思考类似问题时开发出来的许多工具。,This essentially means making some peculiar assumptions that allow one to exploit the bag of tricks that industrial organization theorists developed for thinking about such issues in the 1970s.
6997,住宅的耐久性对市场供给曲线也具有重要意义。,The durability of housing also has important implications for the market supply curve.
6997,考察一下住宅需求增加所带来的效应。,Consider the response to an increase in the demand for housing.
6997,从短期来看，住宅供给是固定的，需求的增加使均衡价格上升。,"In the short run, the supply of housing is fixed, so the increase in demand increases the equilibrium price."
6998,由于被剥夺了任何自主的生命力，自然容易根据人类的意志没有节制地被操纵。,"Deprived of any autonomous life force, nature was open to be manipulated without restraint according to the human will."
6998,如海德格尔后来抱怨的那样，自然成为人类开采的“巨大的加油站”。,"Nature became, as Heidegger later complained, ""one vast gasoline station"" for human exploitation."
6998,"按照法兰克福学派的意见，这种分析所忽略的是内部关系的辩证法，在其中，自然“既是某种外在于人类的东西又是一种内部现实"" (Jay，1973: 267)。","What this analysis elided, according to the Frankfurt School, was the dialectics of internal relations in which nature was both ""something external to man but also an internal reality"" (Jay, 1973: 267)."
6999,为了有效地进行内容分析，研究者必须明确地界定研究单元，以便在其解释中 不存在模棱两可的情况，并构造一个有效的编码系统。,"For content analysis to be effective, the researcher has to clearly identifythe unit of study so that no ambiguity exists in its interpretation and develop an effective coding system."
6999,这意味着所使用的分类必须是“互斥的”（每个研究单元只能被译成一种编码种类）并且是“穷尽的”（所有的研究单元必须有一个可译成编码的分类）。,This means that the categories used have to be 'mutually exclusive' (each unit can only be coded into one category) and exhaustive (all units must have a category into which they can be coded).
6999,正如纽曼(2000)评论的那样，效度和信度的问题也是需要强调的。,"As Neuman (2000) comments, there are also issues of validity and reliability that have to be addressed."
6999,效度和信度问题将在第五章讨论。,Validity and reliability are discussed in chapter 5.
6999,克兰戴尔（1994)提出了一个对文本文件和统计数据进行内容分析的概要性介绍，这将对你非常有用。,Crandell (1994) provides an overview of content analysis of text documents and statistics that you may find helpful.
7000,在《为马诺特而战》中，这种资本主义价值在地方的内在化甚至更为明显。,In The Fight for Manoth this local internalization of capitalistic values becomes even more apparent.
7000,彼得•欧文，一位激进社会生态学家，他被委派去调研在威尔士马诺特乡村河域附近建立一个新城镇可能有什么影响，他说:“实际的历史隐藏在那些嗜血中心的背后：伯明翰一杜塞尔多夫轴心，在伦敦、布罗塞尔、巴黎和罗马都有办公室。”,"Says Peter Owen, the radical sociologist coopted to look at what a new town built in the rural backwater of Manod in Wales might mean, ""the actual history is back there in the bloody centre: the Birmingham-Dusseldorf axis, with offices in London, Brussels, Paris, Rome."""
7001,所有研究绅士化的学者都认为，在这一过程中，经济的和文化的发展都产生了作用，因此，关键的问题是哪一个因素最为重要。,"All writers on gentrification acknowledge that both economic and cultural processes are at work, so the crucial issue is which factor is most important."
7001,这看起来似乎是不可思议的学术争辩，但是它确实对规划和政策制定有着重要的意义。,This might seem like some arcane academic debate but it has important implications for planning and political action.
7001,如果将资本的作用看做是第一位的，就像马克思主义学派的分析一样，那么在资本市场的运作方式没有全面改革的情况下，人的能动性几乎毫无作用。,"If the forces of capital are seen as overwhelmingly dominant, as in structuralist explanations, then human agency can achieve relatively little without wholesale reforms of the operation of capital markets."
7002,"公共部门的重新建立已经在诸如住房私有化和公共服务业方面给城市景观带来了一些重要影响（Pinch, 1997）。","The retrenchment of the public sector has already brought some important changes to the urban scene as, for example, in the privatization of housing and public services (Pinch, 1997)."
7002,从更广的角度看，这些影响可以被解释为从强调集体消费到资本积累转变的一部分。世界范围的主导经济试图通过这个机制使自己走出“滞涨”阶段。,"In broader perspective, these changes can be interpreted as part of the shift in emphasis from collective consumption to capital accumulation that is in turn one of the mechanisms through which the lead economies of the world-system have attempted to steer themselves out of an episode of ‘stagflation’."
7002,同时，逆工业化和经济衰退意味着悬殊的社会空间被强化。,"Meanwhile, deindustrialization and economic recession mean that sociospatial disparities have been reinforced."
7003,尽管如此，但考克斯的方法确实让我们思考，不同的社会行动主体是如何依赖于特定的空间而又谋求与其他运作于和他们自己迥异的依赖空间中的社会行动主体联合的。,"Nevertheless, Cox’s approach does allow us to think about how different social actors may be dependent upon particular spaces yet may seek to engage with other social actors operating within their own, quite different, spaces of dependence."
7003,通过这种途径，尺度的产生以一些不恰当的方式被概念化，其中社会行动主体建立起一些啮合空间，用以连接那些相互依赖的空间，或者它们必须与之打交道的空间。因此，对于考克斯来说，从本土性到全球性尺度的转变“不是从一个平台跳到另一个平台的运动”，而是一种形成共生体网络的过程，这种网络容许社会行动主体在不同的啮合空间进行切换。,"For Cox, then, the production of scale is conceptualized as emerging out of the ways in which actors build spaces of engagement to link the various spaces upon which they, or those with whom they must deal, are dependent, such that moving from  the local to the global scale ‘is not a movement from one discrete arena to another’, but a process of developing networks of associations that allow actors to shift between various spaces of engagement."
7004,罗斯着重研究了“新”文化地理学家的工作，认为有一种不稳定的紧张关系，存在于对景观的愉悦与对景观的认识之间，也存在于女性“自然”与 男性“文化”反复出现的深刻性别差异之间。,"Focusing on the work of ‘new’ cultural geographers, Rose argues that there are uneasy tensions between pleasure in, and knowledge about, landscape that reflect and repeat profoundly gendered distinctions between a feminine ‘nature’ and a masculine ‘culture’."
7004,"如她所述：“景观中的愉悦常常被视为对科学凝视的一种威胁，人们主张地理学家不应让自己因其所见而上当。”（Rose, 1993: 72）","As she writes: ‘Pleasure in the landscape is often seen as a threat to the scientific gaze, and it is argued that the geographer should not allow himself to be seduced by what he sees’ (Rose, 1993: 72)."
7005,货币是男人支配女人的手段，领主控制附庸的手段，帝王统治臣民的手段，资本家控制劳动者的手段。,"Money is a means for men to control women, for lords to control their vassals, for emperors to control their territories and for capitalists to control laborers."
7005,但是，这种借由货币力量进行的社会控制形式假定了某种社会秩序安排，在其中，占有财富(不管如何定义)不可能通过其他手段来实现(例如，农民或农奴不可能迁至未开垦的无主之地，女人不可能独立谋生，劳动者被剥夺了成为私有财富的生产工具，等等)。,"But such forms of social control via money power presume some sort of social ordering in which access to wealth (however defined) cannot be procured by other means (e.g., peasants and serfs cannot move out to unfilled land, women cannot make their own way in the world, laborers are deprived of the means of production which have become privatized, etc.)."
7005,因此，作为社会权力，货币至关重要地依赖自身成为一种控制财富占有的特权手段。,Money as social power therefore depends critically upon it being a privileged means to control access to wealth.
7006,因此，就不难理解争论如何总被内化进入了话语环节。,As a consequence it is not hard to see how contestation is always internalized within the discursive moment.
7006,反霸权和持不同政见的话语(例如，女权主义、反种族主义、生态主义、后殖民主义以及性别主题都是当代学院先锋的最爱)向霸权形式发出挑战。正是由于这些争论，社会变迁才得以发生。,"Counter-hegemonic and dissident discourses (feminism, anti-racism, ecologism, postcolonialism, and the sexual subject are some of the contemporary favorites of the avant-garde in academia, for example) erupt to challenge hegemonic forms and it is out of such contestation that social change may flow."
7007,女性主义范式是对充斥整个旅游研究的占统治地位的男权思想的一种挑战。,The use of a feminist perspectives paradigm will challenge the dominantpatriarchal hegemony that pervades tourism research.
7007,直到最近，大部分旅游研究都被男性掌控，没有人意识到旅游研究中广泛存在的性别偏见。,"Until recently, moststudies have been androcentric in nature and have not taken into accountthe gender bias prevalent in most tourism research."
7007,人们缺乏对旅游中女性角色和体验的研究，女性处于被忽视的地 位(Cook & Fonow 1990)。,"Women's roles orexperiences in tourism in the main have been understudied, and they havebeen generally rendered 'invisible' (Cook & Fonow 1990)."
7007,使用女性主义范式便可以改变这种情况并提供一种平衡的性别视角，从而有助于旅游知识体系的构建。,The use of a feminist perspectives paradigm will start to redress this situation and provide a balanced gender perspective to knowledge construction in tourism.
7008,从另一个角度看，使用二手资料时这种误差将可能依然存在，尽管 “二手”使用者可能没有意识到这种误差。,"On the other hand, the existence of such bias is a possibility when using secondary data sources, although the 'second-hand' user will probably not be aware of such biasing factors."
7008,而在原始资料收集过程中，其他研究者误差的可能性被有效规避，因为“初始”研究者要对整个研究过程负责。并且，人们一般会认为这个研究者的操作遵循了一定的道德规范和适当的科学程序。,"Consequentiy, the possibilityof bias by other researchers is countered in primary data collection as the 'primary' researcher is responsible for the entire research process, and it is assumed that this researcher is operating within an ethical framework and following the appropriate scientific protocols."
7009,频数分布可使用两种方式来描述，第一种是原始计数频率表（raw count fre_x005f_x001f_quency table) ，第二种是百分比频数分布表。,Frequency distributions are portrayed in one of two ways.The first is as araw count frequency table and the second is as a percentage frequency distribution table.
7009,"然而，在给出每种表格的例子之前，很有必要考虑萨兰塔克斯对于（1998, p. 345)构建表格的建议。","However, before providing you with an example of each table, it is useful to consider Sarantakos' (1998, p. 345) advice regardingtable construction."
7009,基本上，表格是由五个部分构成的:标题、表头、主体、旁注及脚注。,"Primarily, tables consist of five components: titles, headings, bodies, marginals and footnotes."
7010,就海洋运输对早期未开发的航海区域所产生的影响这一问题所进行的过程性评价，就是一个评价性研究的例子。,An example of evaluative research would be a formative evaluation of marine transportation impacts in a previously non-utilised marine area.
7010,在旅游规划阶段，对公众参与旅游开发的作用这一问题所做的过程性评价和总结性评价也是一例证。诸如此类的例子还有：如果开发项目得到批准，对项目实施和最终完工阶段会进行过程性评价与总结性评价；对旨在提高某一住宿设施的前厅服务质量的员工发展计划进行的总结性评价；对引入了交叉路口和道路信号灯的旅游区的交通流量情况进行的总结性评价。,"Other examples are formative and summative evaluations of public participation in tourism development in the planning phase and, if the development is approved, formative and summative evaluations of the implementation and establishment phases of the development; a summative evaluation of a staff development program to improve front-office service in a lodging facility; and a summative evaluation of traffic flows in a tourist enclave due to the introduction of roundabouts and improvements in road signage."
7011,"不幸的是，本顿、佩罗曼和奥康纳（Benton, 1989, 1992; Perelman, 1993; O’connor, 1988）等人向那种观点的回归姿态看起来常常是向资本主义论点的悲哀投降。","Unfortunately, the manner of that return by Benton (1989, 1992), Perelman (1993), and O'Connor (1988) often appears as a sad capitulation to capitalistic arguments."
7011,当然，他们之中没有一个人会在任何情况下支持马尔萨斯使用（后来新马尔萨斯主义者持续使用）的具有恶劣影响的阶级区分。,"Not, of course, that any of them would in any way support the class distinctions that Malthus used (and latterday neo-Malthusians continue to use) to such vicious effect."
7011,但是，“自然极限”的普遍性和对“自然法”—满足人类欲望能力的固有限制—更深的依赖，现在已经越来越被视为人类生存的不证自明的限制条件。,"But the universality of ""natural limits"" and the deeper appeal to ""natural law"" as inherently limiting to the capacity to meet human desires, is now increasingly treated as an axiomatic limiting condition of human existence."
7012,报告的内容应该集中在客观事实、研究的实际应用以及研究结果可能带给公众的利益上。,"The content of the report should be focused on the facts, and any practical application of the research and the possible benefits of the research findings for the public."
7012,而不应过分关注报告的结构，除非公众代表一个特殊利益集团，并希望通过此报告来游说政府或商行。,The report should not focus on the overall research design in great detail unless the public represents a special interest group and may want to lobby government or business based on the report.
7012,另外，在准备面向普通公众的报告时，切记不要做任何不能获得赞同的声明。,"In preparing reports for the general public, do not make any unsupported claims."
7013,作为一个研究者，关于是否要进行隐性研究和适当地利用某种欺骗性的手段，你得自己拿定主意。,"As a researcher, you have to make your own decisions regarding covertresearch and the use of deception."
7013,这需要针对该项研究可能对社会产生的道德价值和利用欺骗、隐性研究会在多大程度上损害人的权利两方面进行权衡。,This should be determined by weighingthe 'moral' good such research will do for society against how such covertactivities and deception infringe on the rights of humans.
7013,同时也需要有一个来自你的学科、职业或组织的适当机构对此类行为予以许可。,"It also needs tobe sanctioned by an appropriate body from your discipline, profession ororganisation."
7014,显然，保护人类和非人类参与者的权利是研究者的首要责任。,"Obviously, the protection of human and non-human rights is theresearcher's primary responsibility."
7014,研究不应该给参与者带来任何身体上、法律上或其他的伤害。,"Research should not cause physical, psychological, legal or other harm."
7014,参与者的参与应该建立在自愿和知情同意的基础上。,Research participation should be voluntary and based on in formed consent.
7015,在市中心区，公共政策不能直接要求私人企业到这里开业，这些企业可以在职员下班后为其提供服务，为本地区注人活力。,"In city downtowns, public policy cannot inject directly that entirely private enterprises that serve people after work and enliven and help invigorate the place."
7015,公共政策也不能用任何一种行政命令在中心区留住这些用途。,"Nor can public policy, by any sort of fiat, hold these uses in a downtown."
7015,但是，通过非直接的方式，公共政策可以促进这些用途的成长。用拋砖引玉的方式，它可以在适当的地方利用自己的“棋子”（chessmen）(建筑)和公共场所来间接地促进这种用途。,"But indirectly, public policy can encourage their growth by using its own chessmen, and those susceptible to public pressure, in the right places as primers."
7016,"赏析式探询（appreciative inquiry, AI)是一种在推进组织变革过程中可以用来替代“行动研究” (action research)的方法。",Appreciative inquiry (Al) is an alternative method to action research for facilitating organisational change.
7016,赏析式探询包括四个步骤：阅赏(appreciating)、瞻想(envisioning)、同构（co-constructing)、集思(sustaining a collective vision)。,"Al involves four stages: appreciating, envisioning, co-constructing and sustaining a collective vision."
7016,从赏析式探询在教育机构以及启发式研究中的应用情况来看，可以感受到在旅游业中应用这种方法的潜力，尤其是在转型问题、共同愿景、战略计划、团队开发、焦点群体的研究与评价等领域。,"Use of appreciative inquiry in an educational organisation and heuristic research suggest that appreciative inquiry has the potential for application in the tourism industry, particularly in regard to transformational change, shared visioning, strategic planning, team development, focus group research and valuation."
7017,我想说的并非是整整一个世纪对气候的研究仅仅再次确认了开始所有人就已经知道的事情。,The point is not that a century of research into the weather had only reaffirmed what everyone knew from the beginning.
7017,1919年气象学已经认识到许多民间传说不知道的事情，并解开了许多疑团。,"The meteorology of 1919 had learned many things of which folklore was unaware, and dispelled many myths."
7017,我也不想说气象学家们在这么长的时间里没有观察云朵是一个过失。,Nor is the point that meteorologists somehow sinned by not looking at clouds for so long.
7017,其实这样的事情是不可避免的。,What happened was simply inevitable.
7018,用斯莫尔（1993年）的话说，存在着一种“未能如愿的预备队伍”。一旦公路容最增加，行驶速度就会提高，这个队伍就会转到以前交通拥挤的公路上来。,"In the language of Small (1993), there is a ""reserve army of the unfulfilled"" that will switch to a previously congested highway as soon as an increase in capacity increases travel speeds."
7018,这种潜在需求在高峰期占满大部分或全部新容量。,This latent demand will fill most or all of the new capacity during peak periods.
7019,因此，忠诚问题由阐发政治问题的那种抽象概念的层次和种类同时来定义。,"The question of loyalties is defined, then, both by the level and kind of abstraction through which political questions are formulated."
7019,作为一种情感和情绪性政治力量，忠诚总是附属于某种确定的感觉结构。,"As an affective and emotive political force, loyalties always attach to certain definite structures of feeling."
7019,威廉斯全部小说中个性最丰富的那些角色，正是把冲突性忠诚内化到完全不同感觉结构之中的人——《忠诚》中的格温、《边远的乡村》中的马太•普雷斯以及《第二代》中的欧文•普雷斯。,The richest characters in all of Williams' novels are precisely those who internalize different and conflicting loyalties to radically different structures of feeling – Gwyn in Loyalties or Matthew Price in Border Country and Owen Price in Second Generation.
7020,我用一个高度程式化的经济做了一些模拟实验，在这个经济中，各区位沿一个圆周对称排列。,I have carried out a number of simulation experiments with a highly stylized economy in which locations are lined up symmetrically around a circle.
7020,在每次模拟的开始，制造业都是在各区位随机分布，然后让经济发展演化。,"For each simulation I began with a random allocation of manufacturing across locations, then let the economy evolve."
7020,当然，对于某些参数值，最终全部制造业都集中在一个区位。,"For some parameter values, of course, all manufacturing ends up in a single location."
7021,在有些案例中，取样的数量足够广泛，因此分析结果能用以指导很广大的地区。,"In some cases, sampling has been sufficiently widespread for analyses to be conducted over very wide areas."
7021,例如，休利特等用很多河流水文监测站的数据对美国东部河流产生的暴雨径流进行分类。,"For example, Hewlett et al. used data from a large number of stream gauging stations to categorize the stormflow response of rivers in the eastern USA."
7021,流域管理者了解流域因降雨产生的洪水流量是很重要的。,It is critical for river basin managers to understand the flood response of a river basin following rainfall.
7021,这种方法与趋势面分析的不同之处是没有用回归分析法，但是两种方法都能为区域响应制图。,"The approach differs from trend-surface analysis in that no use is made of regression-type techniques, but both methods allow regional responses to be mapped."
7022,因此，在城市化过程中，似乎没有任何一个地方能够发动为系统转型提供动力的战斗的特殊主义。,There seems then to be no place within the urbanization process from which to launch any kind of militant particularism capable of grounding the drive for systemic transformations.
7022,特别是最近20年来，“全球化”辞令已经变得特别重要，甚至在激进思想中代替了更具政治性的帝国主义、殖民主义和新殖民主义等概念。,"In the last 20 years in particular, the rhetoric of ""globalization"" has become particularly important, even replacing within segments of radical thought the more politicized concepts of imperialism, colonialism, and neo-colonialism."
7022,这种话语转向的意识形态结果特别地剥夺了各种形式的地方、城市甚至国家的政治行动的能力。,"The ideological effect of this discursive shift has been extra-ordinarily disempowering with respect to all forms of local, urban, and even national political action."
7023,确定实体这个问题又引起两个问题。,This issue of entitation raises two problems.
7023,第一个涉及总体和样本。,The first concerns populations and samples.
7023,如果地理学者对他们正在研究的是什么东西尚无把握，那么这对设计检验假设的试验就造成极大的困难。,"If geographers are unsure what it is that they are studying, then this makes the design of experiments to test hypotheses extremely difficult."
7023,第二，有一个统计合理性的问题。,"Secondly, there is the question of statistical validity."
7024,20世纪初，全球只有16个人口超过百万的城市。,"At the beginning of this century, there were just 16 cities in the world with more than a million people."
7024,其中多数都在发达资本主义国家，最大的伦敦也只有不到七百万人口。,"Most were in the advanced capitalist countries and London, by far the largest of them all, had just under seven million."
7024,"那时，也只有不超过7%的世界人口能够合理地归入“城市”(Berry, 1990)。","At the beginning of this century, too, no more than 7 percent of the world's population could reasonably be classified as ""urban"" (Berry, 1990)."
7024,而到2000年，差不多将有500个人口超过百万的城市，其中最大的，如东京、圣保罗、孟买，可能还有上海(这份名单总是不停地变化)，都将拥有二千多万人口，还有20多个拥有一千多万人口的城市紧随其后，它们多数分布在所谓发展中国家。,"By the year 2000 there may well be as many as 500 cities with more than a million inhabitants while the largest of them, Tokyo, Sao Paulo, Bombay, and possibly Shanghai (although the list is perpetually being revised both upwards and downwards), will perhaps boast populations of more than 20 million trailed by a score of cities, mostly in the so-called developing countries, with upwards of ten million."
7024,按目前发展趋势，到21世纪早期，世界将有一半多人口生活在城市而不是乡村中。,"Sometime early next century, if present trends continue, more than half of the world's population will be classified as urban rather than rural."
7025,城市的人行道，孤立来看，并不重要，其意义很抽象。,A city sidewalk by itself is nothing.It is an abstraction.
7025,只有在与建筑物以及它旁边的其他东西，或者附近的其他人行道(sidewalks)联系起来时，它的意义才能表现出来。,"It means something only in conjunction with the buildings and other uses that border it, or border other sidewalks very near it."
7025,同样的道理也可以放在街道上，即除了承载马路中间的交通外，它还有其他的目的。,"The same might be said of streets, in the sense that they serve other purposes besides carrying wheeled traffic in their middles."
7026,电话调査主要是结构式访谈，采用封闭式问题。访问者使用电话技术与受访者交流，并记录答案。,"Telephone surveys are primarily structured interviews using closed questions, with an interviewer recording the respondent's answers .Contact with respondents is made using telephone technology."
7026,计算机技术可以协助电话技术，在这种情况下，使用软件程序可以迅速记录[受访者的回答，分析程序也有助于整合访谈数据。,"Telephone technology may be further assisted by computer technology, in which case the responses are immediately recorded using software programs that integrate the responses with analysis procedures."
7027,散点图也可以描述成关系曲线图或者平面图。,Scattergrams can also be described as a graph or plot of a relationship.
7027,在制作散点图过程中，调査者独立调査每一种情况，然后绘制在散点图上。,"In generating a scattergram, the researcher investigates each case individually and plots it on the scattergram."
7027,当准备一个曲线图来代表散点图的时候，要保证将自变量放在x轴(横轴），将因变量放在y轴(纵轴）。,"When preparing graphs to represent a scattergram, ensure that you place the independent variable on the X axis (the horizontal axis ) and the dependent variable on the Yaxis (the verdcal axis) ."
7027,而且，变量的最小值设置在x轴和y轴相交的地方，最大值设置在轴的外端。,"Furthermore, the lowest values for a variable are located a t the intersection of the X and Y axes, and the highest scores are located toward s the outer ends of the axes."
7028,数据编码包括编码的形成、数据输入及数据整理。,"Coding data involves the development of codes, data entry and data cleaning."
7028,数据输入可使用转换表、页缘编码、直接数据输入、扫描仪、电子数据表以及人工记录单。,"Data entry can be undertaken using transfer sheets, edge-coding, direct data entry, scanners, spreadsheets and manual tally sheets."
7028,数据的整理是与编码式整理和逻辑整理相关联的。,Data cleaning is associated with code cleaning and contingency cleaning.
7029,(5)那么，社会变革的当代事人是谁，他们又在何方呢？,5. So who and where are the agents of social change?
7029,再一次地，最简单的答案是任何人，任何地方。,"Again, the simplest answer is everyone, everywhere."
7029,生活、行动和交谈着的每一个人都牵扯其中。,"Everyone who lives, acts, and talks is implicated."
7029,这正是威廉斯的观点，他认为，通过个人的使用，语言不断地发生着重构。,This is precisely Williams' point concerning the perpetual reconstitution of language through use by individuals.
7030,因此地理学家可能研究作为工业化产物的某个聚落格局的发育。,Thus a geographer might study the evolution of a particular settlement pattern as an outcome of industrialization.
7030,这样的方法侧重于社会过程:工业化是联系着许多相伴随的经济、政治与文化变化的一系列过程。,"Such an approach focuses upon social processes: industrialization is a bundle of such processes relating to shifting work practices with many concomitant economic, political and cultural changes."
7030,此类研究所采取的形式取决于用以界定社会变化性质的社会理论。,The form  that such study takes depends upon the social theory that is used to define the nature of social change.
7031,(3)社会关系总是空间的，并且存在于某种生产出来的空间性框架中。,3. Social relations are always spatial and exist within a certain produced framework of spatialities.
7031,换句话来说，无论在哪个方面，社会关系都是某种绘制的地图，无论是象征的、比喻的，还是物质的。,"Put another way, social relations are, in all respects, mappings of some sort, be they symbolic, figurative, or material."
7031,组织社会关系需要一种绘制行动，以便人们知道他们的位置。,The organization of social relations demands a mapping so that people know their place.
7032,社会科学统计软件包(Statistical Package for the Social Sciences)，顾名思义，就是可以使研究人员对定量数据进行统计分析的程序包。,"Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS ) is, as the name asserts, a package that enables researchers to conduct statistical analyses of quantitative data."
7032,许多大学为SPSS设置了站点许可证。,Many universities hold site licences for SPSS.
7032,该软件包是做定量数据分析最常用的软件包。,It is one of the most frequently used software packages for quantitative data analysis.
7033,意义上的差异是下列两种做法之间的差异，在世界地图的30.03°S和51.10°W坐标那里做一个标记，或者把一个城市称为巴西的阿里格利港。,The difference in meanings is between putting down a marker such as 30.03°S and 51.10°W on a map of the globe or naming the city of Porto Alegre in the state of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil.
7033,在后一种情形中，被命名的实体表明了在一个特定地点上某种有界限的永恒(无论它是否具有政府、社会组织、人造形式、生态结构等)。,"In the latter case, the named entity indicates some sort of bounded permanence (whether it be of government, social organization, built form, ecological structure, etc.) at a given location."
7033,在这个和那个地方发挥作用的社会-生态过程可能会改变时空秩序安排，从而破坏、加强或侵蚀那些特别的永恒，比如说，阿里格利港已经获得的那种永恒。,"The socio-ecological processes at work within that and other places may change spatio-temporal orderings in such a way as to undermine, enhance or erode the particular permanences that, say, Porto Alegre has achieved."
7034,请注意，这是一种卓越的“社会时间”观念；这对同时代的个人或社会而言，并没有处于“真实”时间之前或之后的物理意义。,Note that this is pre-eminently a ‘social time’ idea; it makes no physical sense for contemporary individuals or societies to be in front or behind in ‘real’ time.
7034,然而，在现代性方面对这种社会时间关切的结果，是现代性成为用以界定经历无休止的快速变化社会的标准。,"However, a consequence of concerns for this social time in modernity is that the latter has come to define a society that experiences rapid and ceaseless social change."
7034,因此，时间的概念就是现代性意义的中心以及地理学家试图了解这种情况的中心。,Thus the concept of time is central to the meaning of modernity and of geographers’ attempts to understand this condition.
7035,这就把环境问题牢牢地置于社会主义轨道之上。,This places the environmental issue firmly within the socialist orbit.
7035,"因此，那些承认生态危机的社会主义者(参阅O’Conner, 1988;Foster, 1994)主张，社会主义的第二条道路是可行的，这一道路突出了生产的社会组织与生产(生态的)条件之间的矛盾，而不是阶级矛盾。","Those socialists (see O'Connor, 1988; Foster, 1994) who accept that there is an ecological crisis, then argue that a second route to socialism is available; one that highlights the contradiction between the social organization of production and the (ecological) conditions of production, rather than class contra-dictions."
7035,因此，社会主义的必然性便在某种程度上获得了，因为只有在社会主义条件下，才能彻底地、永久地和公正地解决环境问题。,"The necessity for socialism is then in part given because only under socialism can thorough, enduring, and socially just solutions be found to the environmental problems."
7036,郊区女性的困境并非单纯地由城市分散化造成，它与本书在一开头所概述的整个变化趋势密切相关。,The predicament of suburban women is not simply a consequence of urban decentralization.It is intimately related to a whole nexus of the trends outlined at the beginning of this book.
7036,例如，在以消费为导向并支配当代城市主义逻辑的郊区生活方式中，经济、人口、社会和文化趋势的相互交叉已经将女性放置到了一个关键的位置。,"The intersection of economic, demographic, social and cultural trends, for example, has allocated to women a pivotal role in the consumption-oriented suburban lifestyles that dominate the logic of contemporary urbanism."
7036,简言之，女性受到经济、社会、文化以及生态上的束缚。,"In short, women are trapped economically, socially and culturally, as well as ecologically."
7036,同时，郊区的环境已经以一种加强两性之间不平等的方式演化，并在其他的事物之间加人了情感限制和“社区”侵蚀。,"Meanwhile, the suburban environment has evolved in ways that reinforce inequality between the sexes, contributing, among other things, to emotional strain and the erosion of ‘community’."
7037,“身体和世界之间全部障碍的夷平，以及两者之间转换的流动性”塑造了“中世纪大众文化的以及相应大众想象力的显著特点”。,"The ""characteristic traits of the medieval popular culture and, accordingly of the popular imagination"" were constituted by ""the levelling of all barriers between the body and the world, the fluidity of transition between them"" (p. 54)."
7037,因此，没有什么比使“人成为万物尺度”更加“自然”，因为人们认为“人”与自然不可分离，并把万物内化到自身之中。,"Nothing could be more ""natural"" therefore, than to make ""man the measure of all things"" because man was thought to be inseparable from nature and to internalize all things."
7037,在此，我们与后来“莱布尼茨奇想”的中世纪起源不期而遇(参阅第三章）。,"We here encounter the medieval origins of what later became the ""Leibnizian conceit"" (see chapter 3)."
7038,在一个被过去的开采所破坏和伤害的地区中，要学会在地方生存。,Learning to live-in-place in an area that has been disrupted and injured through past exploitation.
7038,它涉及，通过知晓在某个地方的内部及周围产生影响的那些特殊生态关系而成为那里的本地人。,It involves becoming native to a place through becoming aware of the particular ecological relationships that operate within and around it.
7038,它意味着理解活动和发展社会行为，这些将丰富那个地方的生活，恢复它的生命支持系统，并且在其中建立一种在生态上和社会上可持续的生存形式。,"It means understanding activities and evolving social behavior that will enrich the life of that place, restore its life-supporting systems, and establish an ecologically and socially sustainable pattern of existence within it."
7038,简单地说，它涉及充分活跃于一个地方的内外。,Simply stated it involves becoming fully alive in and with a place.
7038,它涉及申请成为一个生命共同体的成员而不再是它的开发者。（转引自Alexander，1990：163),It involves applying for membership in a biotic community and ceasing to be its exploiter.
7039,例如，让我们看看1883年喀拉喀托火山爆发后重新拓殖的过程。,"For example, consider the recolonization of the Indonesian volcano Krakatau after its famous 1883 eruption."
7039,从一个尺度来说，现在岛上种植园的分布反映了当地的生态位——海岸线、坡地、湿地和其他的生境（habitats）。,"At one scale, today’s plant distribution on the island reflects the local ecological niches – shoreline, slope, wetland, and other habitats."
7039,但是，从更大的尺度来看，总体上的生物多样性取决于其他控制性因素。,"However, at the larger scale, the general biodiversity is dependent on other controlling factors."
7040,"生物地理学中两个主要范例中的第一个是坦斯利（Tansley, 1935）所描述的生态系统的概念。","Two of the major paradigms of biogeography are, first, the ecosystem concept, originally described by Tansley (1935)."
7040,然而，生态系统概念的空间表述联系着第二个关键范例，即植物群落（plant community），或更一般的生境（habitat）。,"The spatial expression of the ecosystem concept is, however, linked to the second key paradigm, which is that of the plant community or, more generally, the habitat."
7040,在未经改造的环境中，植被或生境就是某种生态系统的“外部标志或可见标志”，因为正是在植被或生境之内或下面，生存着、供养着、繁殖着所有更高的营养级。,"In unmodified terrestrial environments, vegetation or habitat is ‘the outward and visible sign’ of a particular ecosystem type because it is within or underneath vegetation or habitat that all higher trophic levels live, feed and reproduce."
7041,在广泛的社会运动中，可以将环境问题分为两个主要观点。,Within this broad social climate it is possible to distinguish two main perspectives on environmental issues.
7041,首先，这里有一个主要的概念，即技术中心方法（technocentric approach)(有时也被称为生态现代化(ecological modernization)方法）。,"First there is the dominant conceptualization, the technocentric approach (sometimes also called the ecological modernization approach)."
7041,这种方法基于这样的假设，即环境问题的解决应当不扰乱当前领导世界发展的资本主义经济构架。,This approach is based on the assumption that environmental problems should be tackled without upsetting the broad capitalist economic frame-work that currently guides world development.
7042,例如，让我们看看1883年喀拉喀托火山爆发后重新拓殖的过程。,"For example, consider the recolonization of the Indonesian volcano Krakatau after its famous 1883 eruption."
7042,从一个尺度来说，现在岛上种植园的分布反映了当地的生态位—海岸线、坡地、湿地等。,"At one scale, today’s plant distribution on the island reflects the local ecological niches – shoreline, slope, wetland, and other habitats."
7042,但是，从更大的尺度来看，总体上的生物多样性取决于其他控制性因素。,"However, at the larger scale, the general biodiversity is dependent on other controlling factors."
7043,假定格林基因先生(一位农民兼基因工程师）研制了一种种植玉米的新方法，使玉米种植成本每英亩减少了300美元。,"Suppose that Mr. Greengenes, a farmer and genetic engineer, develops a new method for growing com that decreases the cost of growing com by $300 per acre."
7043,格林基因的土地所有者欣喜不已，说：“根据剩余原则，你将多付给我300美元的租金。,"Greengenes’s landlord rejoices, saying, according to the leftover principle, you will pay me $300 more in rent."
7043,”土地所有者的话对吗？,Is the landlord correct?
7044,正由于它在持续过程之流中的嵌入性以及流的再现，辩证法有限地诉诸因果观点，并因此将之视为一种特殊的有限情形。,"Precisely by virtue of its embeddedness in and representation of the flow of continuous processes, dialectics makes limited appeal to cause and effect argument and then only as a particular limiting case."
7044,例如，因果观点必然依赖绝对而非相对的时空概念。,"Causal argumentation necessarily rests, for example, upon absolute not relational conceptions of space and time."
7044,"如怀特海证明的那样， “作为过程的自然”或时间之流逝，可能并不存在着对它的“解释” 。“所能够做的就是运用推测性说明（它们）的语言”。（Whitehead, 1920:50）","There can be, argues Whitehead (1920: 53), ""no explanation"" of ""nature as process"" or the passing of time.""All that can be done is to use language which may speculatively demonstrate [them]."""
7045,历时研究是指对同一或相似样本在一定时间段内进行研究。,Longitudinal studies involve the study of the same people or a similarsample of people over a set period of time.
7045,这种研究的数据可能通过访谈、焦点群体法、参与观察法和文献法(在本章后面进行解释)得到。,"Data may be collected usinginterviews, focus groups, participant observation and the documentarymethod (explained later in the chapter)."
7045,历时研究也可用于定量方法，但因为本章关注的是定性研究方法，因此只讨论有关 整体归纳范式的方法。,"Longitudinal studies may also beconducted using quantitative methods; however, as this chapter focuses on qualitative methods, only those methods associated with a holistic-inductive paradigm are discussed."
7045,纽曼（2000)曾划分出历时研究的不同类型：小样本多次调查、时间序列研究、趋势研究以及世代分析。,"Neuman (2000) identifies several types of longitudinal studies: panel studies, time series studies, trend studies and cohort analysis."
7045,他认为案例研究也是历时研究的一种数据收集方法。,He also includes case studies as a method of data collection for longitudinal studies.
7046,另一种适用于社区的“策略”则是顺从那些强加的负外部性（也被称为“忠诚”选择（‘loyally’option))。,Another option available to communities is that of resignation to the imposition of negative externalities (also termed the‘loyalty’option).
7046,当社区感觉到发言权策略经常被忽视或被否决且参与无效时，上述情况就会变得犹为普遍。,This is especially common where communities feel that voicing strategies are regularly ignored or overruled and that participation is ineffective.
7046,例如，许多不同意城市规划的人，不论个体还是团体，往往会由于感觉到无法对政策制定者施加影响而把这些规划当成是“无法避免的”。,"Many people who disapprove of city plans, for example, simply resign themselves to the‘inevitabl’because they feel unable, individually or collectively, to exert any real influence on policy-makers."
7046,"最后一个策略是区位再选择（也被称为“退出”选择（‘exit’option)),这只是一个家庭策略而非社区策略，并且这也回到了实际领地的连续演化地理的观点。","The final strategy is that of relocation (also termed the‘exit’ option), which is a household rather than a community strategy, and which brings us back to the idea of a continually evolving geography of de facto territories."
7047,霍克海默和阿多诺并没有抛弃科学(虽然他们确实提出了一种相当有说服力的方法来理解为什么在生态运动中会有如此众多的人——尤其是自然浪漫主义家——抛弃了科学)。,Horkheimer and Adorno did not abandon science (though they did provide a reasonably compelling way to understand why so many in the ecological movement --particularly the nature romanticists --do).
7047,他们认为批判研究的核心任务是：改革科学本身，试图重新捕获人类意义和目标，把“返魅”于世界的努力(有时被描绘成克服“与自然疏远”)内在化进科学本身，这种努力与作为启蒙思想中的“他者”而嵌入到自然创造物中的“去魅”相对。,"They took it as the key task of critical enquiry to reform science itself, to try and recapture some sense of humanity and purpose and to internalize within science itself some effort at a ""re-enchantment"" with the world (sometimes depicted as over-coming ""alienation from nature"") as opposed to the ""disenchantment"" embedded in that creation of nature as ""other"" in Enlightenment thought."
7047,他们反对实证主义以及通常以牛顿/笛卡儿术语来解释的科学方法，开启了建设一种替代性科学的可能性。,They fought against positivism and the scientific method as usually construed in Newtonian/Cartesian terms but held open the possibility for the construction of an alternative science.
7048,历时研究是对同一或相似样本进行纵向的研究。,Longitudinal studies examine the same sample of people or a similar sample of people over time.
7048,历时研究的类型包括小样本多次调査、时间序列研究、趋势研究、世代分析以及案例研究。,"Types of longitudinal study include panel studies, time series studies, trend studies, cohort analysis and case studies."
7048,数据可通过焦点群体法、参与观察法、访谈法和文献法获得。,"Data may be collected using focus groups, participant observation, interviews and the documentary method."
7049,尽管有点牵强附会，但这个模式还是能够说明问题的。因为它表明为什么正是国际金融（通过世界银行）在今天对生态的可持性如此地感兴趣，以及他们怎样关注这个问题。,"The model, though far-fetched, is illuminating, since it indicates why and how it is that international finance, via the World Bank, is these days so interested in ecological sustainability."
7049,在此，生态和社会计划的两元性（参阅本书第八章）被有趣地扭曲了，因为即使如生态学家们论证的那样，债务偿还真的是许多生态难题的根本，那也正是债务拖欠的威胁迫使国际金融认识到存在着这样的生态难题。,"The duality of ecological and social projects (see chapter 8) here takes some interesting twists for while it is true that debt repayment, as ecologists argue, is at the root of many ecological problems it is precisely the threat of debt default that forces international finance to recognize that such ecological problems exist."
7050,先来考虑一个不参与国际贸易的封闭经济（这听起来有点老掉牙，而且与我们所处的这个出口创造了大量经济奇迹的时代相距十万八千里，也许如此——尽管后面我将证明通过修正，可以使它符合现代经济。不过，现在我们还是按原来的规则开始吧）。,"Imagine, then, an economy that is closed to international trade.(This sounds archaic and way off the point in our current age of export-led economic miracles, and perhaps it is — although I'll argue later that we may be able to modify the story to make it relevant to modern economies. But in any case, for the moment let's play by the original rules.)"
7050,通过对要素供给、技术、需求和市场结构做出假设，我们就可以描述这个假想经济了。,"Our hypothetical economy can be described by assumptions about factor supply, technology, demand, and market structure."
7051,从市场潜力分析中可以立即得出的一个结论是可能存在某种循环关系。,One immediately obvious implication of the market potential analysis is the possibility of circularity.
7051,厂商希望选择市场潜力大的区位，也即靠近大市场。,"Firms want to locate where market potential is high, that is, near large markets."
7051,但是许多厂商聚集的地区才会有大市场。,But markets will tend to be large where lots of firms locate.
7051,所以我们自然而然地会考虑自我增强的地区增长或衰落的可能性。,So one is led naturally to a consideration of the possibility of selfreinforcing regional growth or decline.
7052,社会理论学家朱尔根•哈伯马斯认为，公共领域和组成它的市民们可以被看做是现代社会所特有的四种基本社会组织之一。,"According to social theorist Jurgen Habermas, the public sphere and the citizens who populate it can be seen as one of four fundamental categories of social organization characteristic of modern societies."
7052,其他几种分别是经济、市民社会和政府。,"The others are the economy, civil society and the state."
7052,市民社会（civil society)的含义已经随时间而发生了变化，但它通常被理解为包含除政府以外的所有主要社会元素。,The meaning of civil society has changed over time but is generally understood to involve all the main elements of society outside government.
7052,哈伯马斯指出，这些类别的出现，要求完成公共与私人生活领域相互关系的构建。,"The emergence of these categories, Habermas points out, requires the working-through of an established relationship of the public to the private spheres of life."
7053,"Event-structure analysis(ESA)代表事件结构分析（Neuman 2000, p.432）。","The acronym ESA stands for event-structure analysis (Neuman 2000, p. 432)."
7053,这种分析按照时间顺序组织数据，以此组成事件。,This type of analysis organises data into events following a chronological order.
7053,但是，它与讲故事或叙事却有所不同，因为事件结构在事件发生之前就能够证明事件之间的联系，加之ESA还试图证明因果联系，所以，ESA比重述事件更具分析性。,"However, it is different to storytelling or narratives, as event-structures demonstrate the linkages between events prior to their occurrence.Consequently, ESA is more analytical than a narrative retelling of events, because ESA attempts to identify the causal relationships."
7054,“数据分析是指对你所见、所闻、所读到的信息进行组织以便更好地理解所获信息。,"Data analysis involves organizing what you have seen, heard, and read so that you can make sense of what you have learned."
7054,通过分析这些数据，你可以描述状态、进行解释、提出假设、构建理论，并将你的结论与其他结论进行关联。,"Working with the data, you describe, create explanations, pose hypotheses, develop theories, and link your story to other stories."
7054,而要实现这一目标，就必须首先对所收集的资料进行分类、汇总、建模和解释。,"To do so, you must categorize, synthesize, search for patterns, and interpret the data you have collected."
7054,”,'
7055,数据编码需要人工参与（除非原始数据答案纸是通过计算机扫描的；然而，即便是这样，仍然有可能犯错误，就像以下讨论的）。,"Coding data requires human involvement (unless raw data responses arescanned using computers; however, even then there can be errors, asdiscussed below)."
7055,在输入资料的过程中，人们不管多细心，错误总是难免的。,
7055,,Humans can make errors no matter how careful they are.
7055,数据资料的核对和净化是指检查编码数据以防止出现错误编码，并且通过复查最初的数据，做出必要的更正。,Checking and cleaning the data involves examining the coded data for any incorrectly assigned codes and correcting these errors by reviewing theoriginal data.
7056,数据编码包括编码的形成、数据输入及数据整理。,"Coding data involves the development of codes, data entry and data cleaning."
7056,数据输入可使用转换表、页缘编码、直接数据输入、扫描仪、电子数据表以及人工记录单。,"Data entry can be undertaken using transfer sheets, edge-coding, direct data entry, scanners, spreadsheets and manual tally sheets."
7056,数据的整理是与编码式整理和逻辑整理相关联的。,Data cleaning is associated with code cleaning and contingency cleaning.
7057,双变量分析考虑两个变量之间的关系，两个变量间或者彼此相关，或者彼此无关。,"Bivariate analysis considers the relationship between two variables,which may or may not be related to each other."
7057,相关的变量可描述为证明共变，无关的变量在任何情况下都可描述为独立相关。,Variables that arerelated are described as demonstrating covariation; variables that arenot related in any way are described as having an independent relationship.
7057,判定两个变量间的关系有很多种方法：交叉表、散点图和相关性测量。,"There are a number of ways to determine relationships betweentwo variables: cross-tabulation, scattergrams and measures of association."
7058,举一个例子，假设我们研究居民对在特鲁安(Tourville)城发展娱乐城/度假地的态度。,"As an example, assume another hypothetical study — the study of residents' attitudes to the development of a casino/resort in the city Tourville."
7058,研究设计是使用随机抽样对成年居民进行面对面的访问。,The research design involves a face-to-face interview with adult residents using random sampling.
7058,鉴于特鲁安城有100万人口，不能对所有的居民进行研究，所以我们必须进行抽样。,"Since Tourville has a population of one million, not all residents can be included, so a sample must be undertaken."
7059,因此，差异永远不可能被刻画成“绝对的他性，关系或共性的一种完全缺乏”。,"Difference can never be characterized, therefore, as ""absolute otherness, a complete absence of relationship or shared attributes."""
7059,就如他性和差异本身的生产那样，用来衡量差异和他性的相似性也需要仔细探查(政治上的和理论上的)。,"The similarity deployed to measure difference and otherness requires, then, just as dose an examination (theoretically as well as politically) as does the production of otherness and difference itself."
7059,离开了一方，任何一方都不能成立。,
7059,,Neither can be established without the other.
7060,为了进行一项旨在增进参观者与展品之间互动的研究，研究者可能要在某个文化博物馆中对参观者参观各种展品的方式进行实地考察研究。,The researcher may wish to explore the patterns of visitation to various exhibits in a cultural museum in order to develop a large-scale research project to improve visitor interaction with exhibits.
7060,因此，研究者将从事解释性的研究。,"Consequently, the researcher would engage in exploratory research."
7060,研究者可能想要描述某个特定时间段内参观某个景点或地区的旅游者的社会人口统计特征，从而制定合适的促销和营销策略。,The researcher may wish to describe the sociodemographics of visitors to an attraction or region over a specific time period in order to develop appropriate promotional and marketing materials.
7060,这种类型的研究将会采用描述性的方法。,This type of research would adopt a descriptive approach.
7061,导致特权群体的歧视以及在孤立、廉价住房地区的少数群体地区化的根本因素是他们在整个社会和经济结构中所处的位置。,Underlying both charter group discrimination and the localization of minority groups in particular pockets of low-cost housing is their position in the overall social and economic structure of society.
7061,在这种背景之下，特权群体中的工人阶级成员对少数群体也有歧视，这种歧视与少数群体在丁作和住房市场中的角色有关，他们是竞争者，他们的存在导致了工资下降，并降低了生活质量。,"In this context, discrimination by working-class members of the charter group is related to the role attributed to minority groups in job and housing markets as competitors whose presence serves to depress wages and erode the quality of life."
7061,简而言之，少数群体成了经济体系缺陷的替罪羊。,"In short, minority groups are treated as the scapegoats for the shortcomings of the economic system."
7062,在我看来，这似乎就是雷蒙德·威廉斯通过望远镜的另一端所发现的“战斗的特殊主义”的命题。,"This, it seems to me, is Raymond Williams' thesis of ""militant particularism"" seen through the other end of the telescope."
7062,唯一被认可的普遍性形式是无限尊重建立在由于历史或地理原因产生的共享生活方式之上的特殊性，每一生活方式都有自己的独特“情感结构”。,"The only permissible form of universality is infinite respect for that particularity founded on historically (and geographically) produced shared ways of life, each with its own distinctive ""structure of feeling."""
7062,因为这些结构常常(尽管不是独特地)涉及地方的构造过程，我们发现自己至少被邀请参加一场地理上分裂的正义观念的真正盛宴，这些观念常常通过国家制度、立宪和法律以及风俗仪式呈现出区域性表达方式。,"Since such structures are often (though not uniquely) implicated in processes of place construction, we find ourselves at the very minimum invited to a veritable feast of geographically fragmented notions of justice that frequently take on territorial expression through the institutions of state, constitutionality and law, and the rituals of custom."
7063,从这个角度来看，城市里所有的特殊用地(special land)形式都会与普通的形式产生冲突，是对后者的一种干涉。,"Looked at in this way, all the special land of a city is an interference with the use of the genenl land."
7063,但是从另一个角度看，这种特殊的形式又会对普通的用地形式产生很大的促进作用。,"But looked at in another way, this special land contributes greatly to the use of the general land."
7063,它带来了人。,It contributes people.
7064,假设一个地区经济增长到了关键时候，此时，以本地产品替代生产中具有规模经济的进口产品变得有利可图了。,Suppose that a regional economy grows to the critical point at which it becomes profitable to replace imports of some good subject to scale economies with local production.
7064,这种进口替代会增加该地区就业，吸引其他地区的工人；这样又会进一步扩大当地市场。,"This import substitution will expand regional employment, drawing in workers from other regions; and in so doing will further expand the local market."
7064,而市场扩张反过来又会提供第二轮进口替代必须的市场规模，如此等等——这就是一个地区的增长流，它反映了市场规模和一个地区拥有的产业的范围之间的循环关系。,"This market expansion may, in turn, provide the market size necessary to induce a second round of import substitution, and so ona cascade of growth reflecting the circular relationship between market size and the range of industries that a region possesses."
7065,有了上述对种族主义和种族歧视的说明，我们可以这样解释少数群体居住的集聚与隔离过程，它们与被东道主社会同化（assimilation) 这一过程相反。同化过程本身是由各种形式的群体行为控制的，这些行为是为了将来自外部群体真实的和预期的威胁最小化。,"Given these caveats about racism and discrimination, we can interpret minority group residential congregation and segregation as being inversely related to the process of assimilation with the host society, a process that is itself governed by various forms of group behaviour designed to minimize real or perceived threats to the group from outsiders."
7065,不过，在深人分析这种行为及其空间结果之前，首先有必要明确“少数群体”、“东道主社会”、“隔离”和“同化”这几个术语的含义。,"But before going on to examine this behaviour and its spatial consequences in detail, it is first necessary to clarify the meaning of terms such as‘minority group’, ‘host society’, ‘segregation’and ‘assimilation’."
7066,在半结构化访谈中，一次可能同时采访很多人。,"Sometimes, in semi-structured interviews, several or more people may be interviewed at the one time."
7066,下面的小节将讨论对夫妻一起进行采访。,The following section comments about interviewing heterosexual couples together.
7066,继而将在有关焦点群体法的小节中讨论大规模群体的访谈。,"Larger groups are discussed later, in the section on focus groups."
7067,在当今条件下，最强有力的政治-经济权力来源就是资本主义的生产方式、父权制度和种族主义。,"Under contemporary conditions, the most formidable sources of political- economic power remain capitalist relations of production, patriarchy and racism."
7067,这些统治性社会关系中的每一个都在相互作用——常常，但不总是——互相强化，并产生差异。,"All of these social relations of domination interact – often, but not always, reinforcing each other – and produce difference."
7067,与占统治地位的资本主义生产关系相伴的差异性包括阶级以及如下文所述的在不平衡发展过程中产生的地理差异，包括与帝国主义制度联系在一起的国与国之间的差异。,"The differences associated with capitalist relations of production are those of class and, as discussed below, the geographical differences produced in the course of uneven development, including the differences of nation associated with imperialism."
7068,为了达到他们的目标，资本家们必须将劳动力成本保持在和售价相比尽可能低的水平。,"To achieve their ends, capitalists must hold the costs of labour as low as possible, relative to selling prices."
7068,为此，对于任何特定的商品，他们都通过增加劳动生产率(每单位劳动成本产出的剩余价值量)来寻求降低单位劳动成本。,"To do this, for any particular commodity, they seek to reduce the unit costs of labour by increasing its productivity (the amount of surplus value produced per unit of labour cost)."
7068,这是通过增加在死劳动（特别是比人力本身更有生产效率的机器）方面的投资来实现的。,"This is achieved by increased investment in dead labour, in particular in machinery which is more productive than is human labour per se."
7069,适应性循环模型仍处于幼年期，只有时间才能说明它是否足够强壮。,"The adaptive cycle model is still in its infancy and only time will tell if it is sufficiently robust (see, for example, the discussion by Stafford Smith and Reynolds, 2002)."
7069,目前其弱点似乎在于对释放(崩溃)相的解释，它要求更多的是外部变量(风、火、干旱)而不是固有的内部动力学。,"The weakness at the moment seems to be in the explanation of the release (collapse) phase, which appeals more to external variables (wind, fire and drought) than to intrinsic internal dynamics."
7069,"周期性地从一种稳态跳到另一种稳态是“由慢速变量(突变论水平轴变量)的变化引起的，这种变化激发了快速变的响应，或者逃逸”(Holling et al.,2002:35)。","Periodic flips from one stable state to another are ‘mediated by changes in the slow variables (the horizontal axis variables in the catastrophe theory) that suddenly trigger fast variable response, or escape’ (Holling et al., 2002: 35)."
7070,如果现在存在着如此之多的空间以如此多样的形式环绕在我们周围，显然它们必须争相吸引我们的注意力。,"If there are now so many image spaces swirling through us in so many different ways, it is clear that they must compete for our attention."
7070,图像空间的这个问题正是我想在本节的结论中指出的。,And it is this aspect of image space that I want to point to in concluding this section.
7070,因为很显然，注意力问题可能是今天图像地理学（geography of images）所面临的最紧迫的问题。,For what is clear is that the issue of attention is probably the most pressing one now facing the geography of images.
7071,推断性统计需要使用概率抽样，对检验假设及其与所研究总体之间的关系有重要意义。,Inferential statistics require the use of probability sampling and are important to test a hypothesis and its relationship to the overall population being studied.
7071,推断性统计的检验包括X2（用于定类测量层次）及方差分析（ANOVA）（用于定距测量层次）。,Tests of inferential statistics include chi-square (used with nominal levels of measurement) and ANOVA (used with interval levels of measurement).
7071,推断性统计也涉及研究人员检验统计显著性、考虑统计显著性水平以及一类错误、二类错误。,"Inferential statistics also involve researchers in tests of statistical significance, consideration of levels of significance, and Type I and Type II errors."
7072,本土性即全球性，而地点则是社会关系的空间化网络中“某个特定的时刻”。,"The local is global, and place is a ‘particular moment’ in spatialized networks of social relations."
7072,就好像章鱼的足尖可能会触到海底的某个位置而章鱼的身体却在海中漂浮一样，这样的观点把本土性看成是全球性力量“触及”地球表面时的落脚点。,"Much like the tips of an octopus’s legs might touch particular locations on the seafloor while the body of the octopus floats above it, in such an approach the local appears as the location where global forces ‘touch down’ on to the Earth’s surface."
7072,反过来，本土性也不是一个地点，而是环绕整个地球的全球性潮流通向世界的切入点。,"In turn, the local is not a place but is an entry point to the world of global flows which encircle the planet."
7073,唯心主义和唯物主义在过去的二百年间是影响西方人思想最重要的实体论中的两种。,Idealism and materialism are two of the most significant epistemologies to have shaped Western thought during the past 200 years.
7073,"伊曼纽尔•康德的著作中阐释,唯心主义假定我们在世界上所看到的任何映像都是我们的思想对空间进行分类和排序的产物。","Exemplified by the writings of Immanuel Kant, idealism assumes that any pattern we see in the world is a result of how our mind categorizes and orders spaces."
7073,"实际上,康德仅仅把空间和时间看成是构建存在的精神框架,而不是可以观察到的现实。","Indeed, Kant viewed space and time as simply mental frameworks for structuring existence, rather than observable realities."
7074,在利用电动机械流速仪测量一个方向（主流方向)时间平均流速的地方，以高频率进行测量的现代仪器还测量两个或三个正交的方向。这就意味着不会因为其他两个方向的流速被合并为单个速度组分而损失测量的精密度和准确度。,"The example of measuring flow velocity in rivers also draws attention to the change in dimensionality of much measurement in geography.Where the electro-mechanical current meter measured a time-averaged velocity in one direction (the main flow direction), the modern instruments that measure at high frequencies also measure in two or three orthogonal directions."
7074,所以，这个例子说明地理学接受新技术的严峻形势，新技术使得地理学更接近自然科学传统规范。,
7075,时间和空间概念影响着我们理解世界的方式。,Concepts of space and time affect the way we understand the world to be.
7075,它们也提供了一种参照体系，借助于这个体系，我们定位自己与世界的关系(或者用第三章的语言术语来说，定义自己的“情境性”和“位置性”)。,"And they also provide a reference system by means of which we locate ourselves (or define our ""situatedness"" and ""positionality,"" to use the language of chapter 3) with respect to that world."
7075,因此，进一步讨论时间和空间而不使用“位置”(place)这个术语，这是不可能的。,"It is therefore impossible to proceed far with a discussion of space and time without invoking the term ""place."""
7076,文化通常被认为是像绘画、雕刻、戏剧、古典音乐那样在展览馆、艺术馆、音乐厅或者剧院 里所看到的“髙雅艺术”。,"Culture is popularly thought of as ‘high art’ in the form of paintings, sculpture, drama and classical music, as found in museums, art galleries, concert halls and theatres."
7076,然而，在社会科学中，文化通常具有更广泛意义上的解释。,"However, in the social sciences culture is usually interpreted in a much broader sense."
7076,文化是一种复杂的现象，因此，很难对它进行简单地概括，但最好的解释认为它是“生活方式”的组成。,"Culture is a complex phenomenon, and therefore difficult to summarize briefly, but may best be thought of as consisting of‘ways of life'."
7076,这些生活方式包含了三个重要的因素：首先，它是人们所持的价值观（也就是人们的理想和愿望）。,These ways of life involve three important elements: Values that people hold.
7076,这些价值观包括：对于拥有财富和物质的渴望；在世界范围内通过对世俗追求的克制所获得的精神满足；对家庭的关照；对朋友和邻居的帮助；或者参加政治变革。,These values could include: the desire to acquire wealth and material goods; seeking out risk and danger; attaining spirituality through abstinence from worldly pursuits; caring for a family; help friends and neighbours; or campaigning for political change.Norms that people follow (i.e.
7076,其次，是人们要遵守的许多规范（也就是支配人们生活的规则和原则）。,the rules and principles that govern their lives).
7076,这些规范包括：一些法律规范，如开车是否可以超速，是否可以非法避税。,These include legal issues such as whether to exceed speed limits when driving or whether to engage in illegal forms of tax evasion.
7076,这些规范还包括一些个人行为，如是否对同伴忠诚，是否将个人的发展放在他人需求之上。,Norms also involve issues of personal conduct such as whether to be faithful to one’s partner or whether to put self-advancement over the needs of others.
7076,再次，是人们所使用的物质实体。,Material objects that people use.
7076,对于大多数物质生活柑对富裕的西方社会来讲，这些物质实体包括了从日常消费品到交通系统、建筑物和城市设施。,"For most people in relatively affluent Western societies this is an enormous category, ranging from everyday consumer goods through to transportation systems, buildings and urban facilities."
7077,如这两个例子所示，关于具体化和表述行为以及文化实践与感觉地理学的思想，正在激发大量多样而令人兴奋的地理工作。,"As these two examples show, ideas about embodiment and performativity, cultural practices and sensual geographies are inspiring a diverse and exciting body of geographical work."
7077,这些思想还提出了一些重要的理论上与实践上的挑战。,These ideas also pose some important theoretical and practical challenges.
7077,在人本主义地理学领域内工作的地理学家，其中心任务是通过更全面更直接地参与方法论的辩论，在实践中检验他们自己的研究工作。,A central task for geographers working within a humanities tradition is to examine their own research in practice by engaging more fully and directly with methodological debates.
7078,最近几年，给地方、空间和自然赋予含义已经成为社会、文化和文学理论辩论的至关重大事情（例如，参阅Carter et al，1993)，一当然，地理学家们参与了这些争论。(参阅Bird et al.，1993；Gregory and Urry，1985；Keith and Pile，1993)—方面是似乎突然浮现的全球资本主义文化，另一方面是以特定地方为基础的各种保守的同时也具有潜在进步性的“战斗的特殊主义”，再加上重申一种表面上严重的全球环境恶化的威胁，这两者之间的关系问题部分地推动了这些关注和兴趣。,"In recent years the meanings to be attributed to space, place, and nature have become  a crucial matter of debate in social, cultural, and literary theory (see, for example, Carter et al., 1993) — a debate in which geographers have certainly participated (see Bird et al., 1993; Gregory and Urry, 1985; Keith and Pile, 1993).These sorts of concerns and interests have been impelled in part by the question of the relations between what appears to be an emergent global capitalist culture on the one hand and the reassertion of all sorts of reactionary as well as potentially progressive ""militant particularisms"" based in particular places on the other, coupled with a seemingly serious threat of global environmental degradation."
7078,但是，这些关注在某种程度上也是威廉斯推动的文化研究传统的急剧膨胀所引起的，它强调感觉结构、价值、嵌人性、差异、反霸权话语的特殊性以及对立群体构造的社会关系。,"But the concerns have also-in part been produced by a burgeoning tradition of cultural studies that Raymond Williams helped to define, with its emphasis upon structures of feeling, values, embeddedness, difference, and the particularities of the counterhegemonic discourses and social relations oppositional groups construct."
7079,毫无疑问，近年来城市研究中最重要的变化是对文化问题的不断关注。,Without doubt the most important change in urban studies in recent years has been the increased attention given to issues of culture.
7079,这一发展反映了 社会科学研究中的一个广泛趋势，即著名的“文化转向”（‘cultural turn’）。,This development reflects a broader trend in the social sciences that has become known as the ‘cultural turn’.
7079,文化转向的结果不仅在文化研究中成为一个迅速扩大的领域，而且对包括地理学、社会学和城市研究在内的其他学科同样产生了深远的影响。,
7079,就像社会空间辩证法认为的那样，文化一直对城市有着深刻的影响，同时，城市也影响着文化。,"As suggested by the sociospatial dialectic, cities have long had a crucial impact upon, and have in turn been influenced by, cultures."
7080,研究者能够获得两种类型的资料：原始资料和二手资料。,Researchers are able to access two types of data sources: primary and secondary.
7080,原始资料是指那些为了他们研究项目的使用目的而由研究者第一手收集的资料。,Primary data sources are those that are collected first-hand by the researcher for use in their research project.
7080,原始资料来源包括诸如问卷调査、访谈文本和观察。,"Primary data include, for example, responses to questionnaires, interview texts and observations."
7080,二手资料是指那些因其他人的初始使用目的而产生但后来被与初始项目不相关的另外的研究者使用的资料。,Secondary data sources are those that have been produced by someone else for primary usage and are then used by another researcher not connected with the first project.
7081,其他用于问卷设计的量表当属瑟斯东和哥特曼量表了。,Other scales that may be used in questionnaire construction are Thurstonescales and Guttman scales.
7081,瑟斯东量表用于测量态度，但该量表需由专家决定其结构且较为耗时，并且还要求为纳入此量表的项目做出相关评判（Babbie 1990)。,"Thurstone scales are used to measure attitudes; however, the scale is dependent upon experts for its construction.Thurstone scales are time-consuming and demanding in judging items relevant for inclusion (Babbie 1990)."
7081,哥特曼量表用于测量社会距离，特别是测量受访者所接受的与其他类型人的社会距离（Sarantakos 1998)。,"Guttman scales measure social distance, particularly how close a respondent will allow another type of person to be to them (Sarantakos 1998)."
7082,美国环境正义运动产生的这些条件说明了它的一些主要特点。,These conditions of production of an environmental justice movement in the United States account for some of its central features.
7082,首先，对某些特殊污染——有毒物和危险的污染物——的集中关注把讨论压到了象征问题上，清楚说明了，就如污染那样，这个问题也是有关“地位的诉求和反诉求”的(Douglas，1984:3)。,"To begin with, the focus on particular kinds of pollution — toxics and dangerous contaminants — loads the discussion towards symbolic questions, making clear that the issue is as much about ""claims and counter-claims to status"" (cf. Douglas, 1984: 3), as it is about pollution per se."
7082,这就是使运动具有如此巨大道德力量和道德义愤能量的东西。,This is what gives the movement so much of its moral force and capacity for moral outrage.
7083,相反，新的方法只是在原有基础上增加了一点新的内容，两个变数这种简单体系仍是城市秩序的目标。,"Rather these new ideas were added.Simple, two-variable systems of order were still  the aim."
7083,不同的是，在无序复杂性问题(disorganized complexity)这种新概念体系里，两个变数简单体系则更有了存在的理由。,"But these could be organized even more ""rationally"" now, from our of  a supposed existing system of disorganized complexity."
7083,简而言之，概率和统计分析这种新的方法使得人们有可能对所谓的城市问题进行鸟瞰式分析，提供更多的“准确性”和更广泛的分析范围。,"In short, the new probability and statistical merhods gave more ""accuracy,"" more scope, made possible a more Olympian view and treatment of the supposed problem of the city."
7084,在我们中的许多人看来，科学研究中一个成功的领域就是基础物理学，从某种意义上说这是不幸的。,It is in a way unfortunate that for many of us the image of a successful field of scientific endeavor is basic physics.
7084,大部分基础物理学的目标就是对发生的事情提供一个全面的描述。,The objective of the most basic physics is a complete description of what happens.
7084,从原理上，尤其是从实践中看，量子力学完整地描述了一个氢原子内部发生的状况。,"In principle and apparently in practice, quantum mechanics gives a complete account of what goes on inside, say, a hydrogen atom."
7084,但是，我们希望分析的大多数事情，即使是物理科学中的事情，都达不到那样的全面和完整。,"But most things we want to analyze, even in physical science, cannot be dealt with at that level of completeness."
7085,然而，《太阳报》整个报道的宗旨暗示着，犯罪是非裔美国人和“下层阶级”的习惯。因此，构筑栅栏反对有色人种和低收入人群，尽管令人遗憾，但也许是正当的。构筑栅栏旨在确保可防御的“社区”空间的安全，这样做是合理的。否则的话，那些富有的白种中产阶级人口将会逃离城市。,"The whole tenor of the Sun's report implied, however, that crime was an African–American and ""underclass"" habit and that therefore the construction of barriers against people of color and of low income, however regrettable, might be justifiable as a means to secure a defensible space of ""community"" for an affluent white middle-class population that might otherwise flee the city."
7086,必须创造出组织、制度、学说、计划、形式化的结构以及诸如此类的东西。,"Organizations, institutions, doctrines, programs, formalized structures and the like simply have to be created."
7086,并且，这些政治行动必须牢牢地植根于人类行动得以展开的那些具体的历史和地理条件，并有能力改造它们。,And these political activities must be firmly grounded in and transformative of the concrete historical and geographical conditions through which human action unfolds.
7086,在传统的共产党先锋派(列宁的幽灵)和理想化的先锋派(德里达的幽灵)之间存在一个政治组织和斗争的地带，它亟待培育。,Between the traditional avant-gardism of communist parties (the specter of Lenin) and an idealized avant-gardism (the specter of Derrida) there lies a terrain of political organization and struggle that desperately cries out for cultivation.
7087,有许多有关统计显著性的检验。,There are a number of tests of statistical significance.
7087,不同的检验有不同的应用，这取决于测量的层次及样本的数量和类型。,Different tests have different applications depending on the level of measurement and the number and type of samples.
7087,"萨兰塔克斯（1998, p. 403)对比较普遍的显著性检验进行了概括，如表9-7所示。","Sarantakos (1998, p. 403) provides a summary of the more common tests of significance, and this is illustrated in table 9.7."
7088,统计显著性通常用显著性水平来描述（Neuman 2000)。,Statistical significance is generally described with respect to levels of significance (Neuman 2000).
7088,在研究报告中常用的三个显著性水平是0.05、0.01及0.001(Babbie 1995；Neuman 2000)。,"One of three levels of significance is usually reported: 0.05, 0.01, or 0.001 (Babbie 1995; Neuman 2000)."
7088,这些水平分别代表了由于抽样误差的原因使得测量到的相关概率是5%，1%，1‰。,
7088,,"Respectively, the levels refer to a 5 in 100, a 1 in 100 or a 1 in 1000 chance of an association between the variables being a result of sampling error."
7089,我们生活在称之为“现代”的世界中。,We live in a world we call ‘modern’.
7089,现代的想法是非常富含时间概念的一种思想。,The idea of modern is a very time-laden one.
7089,"要做到现代，就是要“与时俱进”，就是要赶上时代,就是要使用最新的小玩意儿或思想，就是要追随最时髦的服饰或游戏。","Being modern is to ‘move with the times’, to be ‘up to date’, to be a user of the newest gadgets or ideas, to be a follower of the latest fashions in clothes, furnishings or games."
7089,总的来说就是现代社会人们定义的一种现代性(modernity)状态。,"Collectively, a society of modern people defines a state of modernity."
7090,如果可以从多种立场观察世界将更好地理解世界如何作为一个总体性运行的途径。,Learning to see the world from multiple positions — if such an exercise is possible — then becomes a means to better understand how the world as a totality works.
7090,多种多样的投射(数学的和精神分析的)大体上可以相互转换。,Multiple projections (mathematical and psychological) are in principle trans-formable into each other.
7090,那就是哈拉维(1991: 193) 所设想的方式。,That is how Haraway (1991: 193) visualizes it.
7090,她把相对论和总体性作为“许诺通天之眼的上帝诡计”加以拒绝。,"Rejecting both relativism and totalization as ""god tricks promising vision from everywhere and nowhere equally."""
7091,与那些在英国经验论传统中成长起来的其他思想家一样，怀特海也致力于对相关性观点进行现实主义的而不是逻辑学的理解。因此，他反对莱布尼茨转向纯粹唯心主义的倾向。,"To begin with, Whitehead, as befits someone raised in the traditions of British empiricism, pushed for a realist rather than a logical version of the relational view He thereby counters Leibniz's tendency to veer off into unalloyed idealism."
7091,他还具备在爱因斯坦提出广义相对论之后的写作优势。,He also had the advantage of writing after Einstein published the general theory of relativity.
7091,虽然他怀疑爱因斯坦的解释(因此打开了相对性和相关性观点之间的缺口)，但他绝不怀疑爱因斯坦的重要性和准确性。,While he disputed Einstein's interpretations (thereby opening a gap between the relative and relational views) he never doubted the importance or veracity of Einstein's discoveries.
7092,双变量分析考虑两个变量之间的关系，两个变量间或者彼此相关，或者彼此无关。,"Bivariate analysis considers the relationship between two variables, which may or may not be related to each other."
7092,相关的变量可描述为证明共变，无关的变量在任何情况下都可描述为独立相关。,Variables that are related are described as demonstrating covariation; variables that are not related in any way are described as having an independent relationship.
7092,判定两个变量间的关系有很多种方法：交叉表、散点图和相关性测量。,"There are a number of ways to determine relationships between two variables: cross-tabulation, scattergrams and measures of association."
7093,威廉斯指出，最后出现的是：“否定的政治学、差别的政治学、抽象分析的政治学。而且，不管我们是否喜欢，它们甚至对于理解正在发生的事情都是必要的。,"It comes, Williams notes, ""the politics of negation, the politics of differentiation, the politics of abstract analysis. And these, whether we liked them or not, were now necessary even to understand what was happening."""
7093,”就环境正义运动情况来说，不断寻求媒体的关注和事件的肖像学——象征政治学正是围绕它们而建立——承载着它自己的消极影响。,And in the case of the environmental justice movement the constant search for media attention and an iconography of events around which to build a symbolic politics carries its own negative freight.
7094,所有这些又都再次指出了第三章中所提到的日常生活的消费和审美化（aesthetidzation)的重要性。,All this points once again to the importance of consumption and of the aestheticization of everyday life introduced in Chapter 3.
7094,消费“旨在消除陌生人之间存在的恐惧。,Consumption purports to dispel the dread of being in a world of strangers.
7094,广告告诉我们应该期待的事物、可接受的或不可接受的事物，以及为了获得它们我们需要去做的事情。,"Advertisements tell us what to expect, what is acceptable and unacceptable, and what we need to do in order to belong."
7094,它们是生产和传播文化符号的主要载体”。,They are primary vehicles for producing and transmitting cultural symbols.
7094,消费“不仅仅有生产和循环的意义，它……交织着并改变着力量和观点，并使得我们能够在日常生活中改变我们的文化，改造自然，并创造地方”。,"[Consumption] not only produces and circulates meaning, it . . . interweaves and alters forces and perspectives, and it empowers us in our daily lives to change our culture, to transform nature, and to create place."
7095,对消费者选择问题的分析可以分成两个部分。,The analysis of the consumer-choice problem can be divided into two parts.
7095,无差异曲线（indifference curve)总结了消费者对可选择的消费品的主观偏好。,An indifference curve summarizes tbe consumer‘s subjective preferences about alternative consumer goods.
7095,预算线（budget line)表示对消费者的约束（限制）。,The budget line shows the limits (constraints) imposed on the consumer.
7096,系统性的轨迹并不难识别。,Traces of systematicity are not hard to identify.
7096,货币、商品、信息、人造制品、技术、象征体系的流动，都是日常生活的一部分，它们都对身体的感觉表现产生了影响，都在价值关系的定义中发挥着独持的作用，都提供把全球时间和空间协同起来的共同凝聚力。,"Flows of money, commodities, information, cultural artefacts, technologies, symbolic systems, all are part of daily life, have their effects upon the sense presentation of the body, play their role in defining value relations and provide some sort of common glue of cogredience across a global space and time within which multiple cartographies (embodied understandings) get defined."
7096,在那种时空中，各种各样的绘图法(具体化的理解)得到定义。,
7097,河床泥沙搬运的突变论表述。,Catastrophe theory representation of bed-load sediment transport.
7097,在C点，当河流携沙力达到阈限值时携带底质的能力突然提高。,"At C, there is suden high entrainment of bed material as stream power reaches a threshold value, leading to high bed-load transport."
7097,在D点发生大量沉积，因为随着河流携沙力下降超过了携带该分选粒级迁移的阈限。,"At D, there is general deposition as stream power falls."
7097,虚线表示短命河道中洪水涨落的历程。,The dotted line represents the passage of a flood wave in an ephemeral channel
7098,"默里(1982, p. 15)指出了写作过程的三个步骤：构思、写作、修改。","Murray (1982, p. 15) has identified three stages in the writing process — pre-writing, writing and rewriting."
7098,格瑞伍斯(1984)也指出了写作过程的三个阶段：构思 (预写）、撰写和写作之后（首稿完成后的所有活动）。,"Graves (1984) also uses three phases — rehearsal (pre-writing), composing and post-writing (all activities after the first draft is completed)."
7098,"麦克罗瑞（1980, P. 297)提出了四个阶段的模型：收集、模仿、修正和写作。","Macrorie (1980, p. 297) uses a four-phase model — collecting, imitating, revising and writing."
7098,从某种意义上说，他们所描述的是同一过程，该过程并非一蹴而就的。,"In a sense, they are all describing the same process, one in which one-shot writing is rarely the norm."
7099,在进行研究时，无论使用定性方法还是定量方法，研究者都必须要同时保证信度和效度问题。,"When engaging in research, whether it is research that uses a quantitative or a qualitative methodology, the researcher must address issues of reliability and validity."
7099,从本质上说，研究者必须清楚收集资料所使用的问题和方法是可靠的和有效的。,"Essentially, the researcher must check that the questions and measures being used to gather data are reliable and valid."
7099,虽然信度和效度往往同时使用，但是两者有着不同的含义，正如下面的探讨中概括的。,"Although used together, reliability and validity have quite different meanings, as outlined in the following discussion."
7100,你过去怎样看待共产主义，你现在怎样看待自然，只不过是投你所好东西。,"What you thought about communism, what you now think about nature, is no more than a projection of what suited you."
7100,对其他人来说，每一信仰都是真实的，这个事实只不过让你来欺骗他们。,The fact that for others each belief is substantial merely enabled you to deceive them.
7100,(Loyalties，364),"(Loyalties, p. 364)"
7101,这二种元素都通过大脑过滤和编码，并形成一系列意象，构成了个人意识空间的运作部分。,Both elements are subject to a mental filtering and coding that produces a set of imagery that constitutes the operational part of the individual’s awareness space.
7101,意识空间中构成搜索空间的子集仅仅是家庭认为与期望区域有关的地区，并且搜索空间具有空间偏向性是由于包括活动空间和意境地图所具有的内在偏向性。,"The subset of this space that constitutes the search space is simply the area (or areas) that a household feels to be relevant to its aspiration region, and it is spatially biased because of the inherent bias in both activity spaces and mental maps."
7101,而且，不同类型的家庭，由于活动空间和意境地图的不同，其住房寻找行为也倾向于表现出不同的空间偏向。,"It follows that different subgroups of households, with distinctive activity spaces and mental maps, will tend to exhibit an equally distinctive spatial bias in their search behaviour."
7102,这种方法与创造了 “行动研究” 一词的赖文（Lewin 1948)的观点不一致。,"Such an approach is at odds with Lewin (1948), who first coined the term 'action research'."
7102,在行动研究中，研究与行为间的界限已经相当模糊(Patton 1990，p.157)。,"In action research, the 'distinction between research and action becomes quite blurred' (Patton 1990, p. 157)."
7102,这会妨碍行动研究获得赖文所谓的行动研究的利益对于知识（理论）以及改善人类状况（实践）的贡献。,"This can militate against allowing action research to achieve what Lewin described as the benefits of action research — a contribution to knowledge (theory), as well as the betterment of human conditions (practice) (Lewin 1948)."
7103,同样，你可能会认为保守经济学家们会替供给学派中他们的政治同盟说说好话，或许还会任命几位供给学派的忠实信徒在他们的系里任职。,"Similarly, one might have expected to find conservative economists willing to say nice things about their political allies in the supply-side camp, and perhaps to appoint a few supply-side true believers to their departments."
7103,但实际上即使在明尼苏达或卡内基—梅隆这样相当保守的经济学系，他们也没有这样做。,"But in fact they do not, even at fiercely conservative departments like those at Minnesota or Carnegie-Mellon."
7103,那么这仅仅是行会思想吗？,So is it just guild mentality?
7103,你只有获得博士学位才有发言权吗？,Do you have to have a Ph.D. to be listened to?
7103,但是，获得博士学位——甚至拥有卓著的学术声誉——并不能保证你的经济学观点会受到尊敬。,"Well, having a Ph.D.even having an established professional reputation is no guarantee that your economic ideas will be treated with respect."
7104,对此的反应是所谓“行为地理学”的发展。行为地理学具有：过程指向。,The reaction to this was the development of what became known as 'behavioural geography' which was：the process oriented.
7104,所强调的过程……是诸如学习、感知、认识、 态度形成等等的人类行为过程（P.1327)。,"The processes emphasized ... are human behavioural processes such as learning, perception, cognition, attitude formation, and so on ...(p. 1327)."
7105,这一段话既直率又令人吃惊，它表明，各种各样的限制如何以环境名义被强加到“他者”权利之上，同时又把各种权利(以及义务)赋予那些据说拥有知识和技术的人，让他们来控制这个难题。,"Both blunt and startling, this statement illustrates how, in the name of the environment, all kinds of restrictions should be put upon the rights of ""others"" while conferring rights (and obligations) on those who supposedly have the knowledge and the high technology to control the problem."
7105,尽管在今天极少有人敢如此嚣张，但是，在世界银行的论证中，甚至像《布伦特兰报告》这样表面进步的文件，仍然存在着这种思维方式的强烈色彩。,"While few would now dare to be so blatant, there is a strong strain of this kind of thinking in World Bank arguments and even in such a seemingly progressive document as the Brunddand Report."
7105,以地球健康、可持续性或阻止环境恶化的名义控制他人资源，这种做法绝不会在西方全球环境管理目标中消失。,"Control over the resources of others, in the name of planetary health, sustainability or preventing environmental degradation, is never too far from the surface of many western proposals for global environmental management."
7106,有一些二手资料可能本身也不够完整。,Some secondary documents may not be in complete sets or may be incomplete.
7106,尤其是一些行政文件更是如此。,This is especially true of administrative documents.
7106,例如，对于非营利机构来说，获得完整的资料可能是有困难的。,"In nonprofit associations, for example, accessing complete data sets may be problematic."
7106,有时，在执行行政管理任务时由于缺乏人手，有些文件就可能根本没有归档。,"Sometimes, the lack of personnel to carry out administrative tasks may mean that some documentation is not undertaken."
7106,有时由于人事更迭而导致文件无法找到或者调离人员无意中带走一部分文件，就更难以收集到完整的行政管理资料了。,"Alternatively, documentation may be incomplete because it has been misplaced during a changeover of new executive members and/or unexpected departures of executive members who may accidentally take any documentation with them."
7107,工人阶级政治在美国自20世纪70年代中期以来的削弱可以追溯到很多原因，不能在这里详细展开，但是一个推波助澜的因素就是围绕特殊问题的“进步”政治越来越分裂，以及那些所谓新社会运动的兴起。,"This weakening of working-class politics in the United States from the mid-1970s on can be tracked back to many causes which cannot be examined in detail here.But one contributory feature has been the increasing fragmentation of ""progressive"" politics around special issues and the rise of the so-called new social movements focusing on gender, race, ethnicity, ecology, sexuality, multiculturalism, community, and the like."
7107,这些运动聚焦于性别、种族、种族划分、生态、性、多元文化主义、社群等等方面，它们常常成为传统阶级政治的实用而有效的替代方案。而且在某些情况下，它们对这些政治会表现出彻头彻尾的敌意。,These movements often become a working and practical alternative to class politics of the traditional sort and in some instances have exhibited downright hostility to such class politics.
7108,在400个回复者中，有256人表示曾经在肖尔沃特湾及其附近水域进行过休闲活动，142人表示他们去肖尔沃特湾并不是出于休闲的目的，2人没有提供有关研究区域使用情况的数据。,"Of the 400 respondents to the survey, 256 indicated that they were users of the area, while 142 indicated that they did not use the area for recreational purposes and 2 respondents did not provide data regarding usage of the study area."
7108,在256个该区域的使用者中，245人曾进行过休闲垂钓，也就是说97.5%的回复者都是该区域的垂钓者。,"Of the 256 users of the area, 245 respondents engaged in recreational fishing, that is 95.7% of respondents were fishers of the area."
7108,一些使用者还指出，他们也进行例如划船、露营和观光等其他活动。,"Some users indicated that they also engaged in other activities such as boating, camping and sightseeing."
7109,修订阶段：请一位“挑剔”的读者阅读文章并提出改进建议，或作者本人通读全文，以确保文章内容衔接自然流畅，保证写作目的和文章内容高度一致。,"In the revising stage, you may allow a critical reader to respond to your text or you may re-read the text to ensure that all the sections are cohesively linked and your intent and content match."
7109,在拟稿和修订阶段之间需要间隔一段时间，这样可以使作者以全新的视角来重新审视文章。,You need to allow time between the drafting and revising stages so that you can come to the text with fresh eyes.
7109,通常，当我们集中一段时间完成一篇文章时，由于我们对它太过熟悉，当时可能认为它已经完全表达出我们的思想，但事实并非如此。,"Often, when you have been working on a text for a period of time, you may think it says what you want when it does not, as you have become too close to the text."
7109,而拟稿和修订阶段间隔的这段时间则可使作者更加严格地审视该文，所以，制订合理的工作进度表非常必要。,"Time between drafting and revising enables you to look at the text more critically, and you need to plan your time schedule to allow this to happen."
7110,戴维•哈维（David Harvey)的空间实践“网格”（表9一 1)为我们提供了一种适用于更广泛、更丰富的研究课题的方法，这些课题包括地方作为物质性人造物而被构建和体验的方式、 地方被表述的方式、地方作为空间符号在现代文化中被使用的方式。,"David Harvey’s‘grid’of spatial practices (Table 9.1) provides one way of accommodating a broader, richer array of issues in addressing the ways in which places are constructed and experienced, how they are represented, and how they become used as symbolic spaces."
7110,该矩阵有助于将我们的注意力集中到体验、感知和意象之间的辩证关系上，同时也有助于我们阐明地方的延展、地方的占用、地方的统治和地方的生产之间的关系。,"The matrix is useful in focusing our attention on the dialectical interplay between experience, perception and imagination; and in clarifying the relationships between distanciation and the appropriation, domination and production of places."
7110,但是，它并没有简化为一个理论：它仅仅是一个框架，我们可以通过它来解释阶级、性别、社团和种族的社会关系。,"It does not, though, summarize a theory: it is merely a framework across which we can interpret social relations of class, gender, community and race."
7111,断代方法多种多样，从沉积岩简单的叠置规则(越深越老)到放射性同位素定年。,Dating methods ranged from  the simple rule of superimposition for sedimentary rocks (deepest are oldest) to radio-isotope dating.
7111,随着断代方法的改进，历史序列的精度也在改进。对气候断代的重视(如冰期和暖期与冷期)结合孢粉地层学使问题混淆了，研究重点从对过程的研究转移到地形断代，有时因缺乏明确的目标而陷入循环的争论。,"As the methods of dating improved, so the precision of the historical sequence could also be improved.Emphasis on climatic dating (such as glaciations and warm and cold periods), coupled with pollen stratigraphy, confused the issue by shifting the emphasis to dating landforms and away from  the study of processes, sometimes leading to circularity of argument through a lack of clarity of objectives."
7112,从事行动研究的研究者可能选择使用书面形式、口头形式或图像形式的报告。但是对于其中的一些研究者来说，对研究对象做出改变可能是研究的唯一要求，而不需要报告研究结果。,"Researchers who engage in action research may choose to use written, oral or visual reports, and, for some, the change in the issue being studied may be the only outcome required and no report eventuates."
7112,但是，这里仍然为行动研究报告提供了参考格式。,"However, a suggested format for action research reports is provided here."
7112,就像案例研究一样，行动研究报告可以以科学实验报告的结构为模型（引言、文献综述、方法、结果分析及未来研究计划），也可选择其他不同的模型。,"As with case studies, the report may be based on the scientific experimental model (introduction, literature review, method, findings and analysis, and future action plans), but there are alternative models."
7113,知情同意要求正在进行研究的参与者们完全知晓此研究的性质。,Informed consent requires that research participants are fully apprised of the nature of the research in which they are participating.
7113,当参与者被研究活动的某些方面所蒙蔽时，就等于出现欺骗。,Deception occurs when participants are deceived about some aspects of the research.
7113,举个例子来说，发起人的真实身份被伪装，或者用一些含糊的术语来表述整个研究的目的，或故意扭曲研究目的。,"For example, the true identity of the sponsor may be masked or the overall research purpose may be couched in ambiguous terms or purposefully misrepresented."
7114,联合主题发言是由几个从事相同或相似研究的研究者一起讨论他们的研究成果。,Panel sessions involve a group of researchers from the same research project or similar research projects discussing their research findings.
7114,在这种发言中，研究课题展示了不同的视角，听众人数要比个人发言多，而且互动的效果也更充分。,Different perspectives on the overall research topic should be elicited from such discussions and audience engagement and interaction should be higher than during a stand-up presentation.
7114,这种联合发言通常持续一个小时到一个半小时，其间会有热烈的讨论。,Panel sessions usually are allocated one to one-and-a-half hours to allow time for 'lively' debate.
7115,准备使用混沌理论范式的研究者需要理解该范式及与其相关的研究含义。,Researchers intent on using the chaos theory paradigm need to understand the paradigm and its associated implications for research.
7115,研究者和学生在以往的研究中借用某些词汇的隐喻义，创造了有关混沌理论的专用词汇，其中包括术语“混沌”。,"In the past, researchers and students have appropriated the vocabulary for use in a metaphorical sense, including the term 'chaos'."
7115,其实，理解混沌理论(混沌现象）中使用的术语或词汇的隐喻意义与专业定义之间的差别是很重要的。,"It is important to understand the difference between the metaphorical and technical meanings associated with the terms and vocabulary used in chaos theory (Symptoms of Chaos, n.d.)."
7115,另外，混沌理论也受到复杂理论的挑战。做旅游研究的研究者要说明为何选用混沌理论而不是复杂论作为研究范式。,"Furthermore, chaos theory is being challenged by complexity theory and researchers need to address this challenge when outlining their preference of chaos theory over complexity theory as a paradigm to inform tourism research."
7116,随机抽样可以由电脑程序产生。,Random samples may be generated by computer programs.
7116,"这时,研究者必须能够获得抽样框，如旅客名单、旅馆名录、景区名册、俱乐部名单或组织成员名单。","The researcher has to have access to a sampling frame, such as a passenger list, an accommodation listing, an attractions list, or a list of club or association members."
7116,在抽样框中每个对象被指定一个号码。,Each individual entry on the sampling frame is assigned a number.
7116,要抽取的随机号码的总数是确定的，接着计算机程序就可以识别抽样单位。,The number of random numbers to be selected is determined and then the sample units are identified by the computer program.
7117,第五栏是由本地每个前置号码中的居民号码的数量占居民号码总数（2800）的比率，结果以百分数形式表示。,"Column 5 is determined by dividing the number of residential numbers in each prefix by the total number of residential numbers in Local town (2800), and expressing the answer as a percentage."
7117,由此我们便了解了从每个前置号码（层次）中抽取的样本数占总样本数的比率。,We now know the percentage of our overall sample size that must be drawn from each of the prefixes (strata).
7117,例如，如果我们的样本容量是1000，我们在前置号码49390内的呼叫电话就有36个号码，在 49391中呼叫71个号码等。,"For example, if our sample size is 1000, we would call 36 numbers in the prefix 49390, 71 numbers in prefix 49391, and so on."
7118,先来考虑一个不参与国际贸易的封闭经济（这听起来有点过时，而且与我们所处的这个出口创造了大量经济奇迹的时代毫不相关，也许如此——尽管后面我将证明通过修正，可以使它符合现代经济。不过，现在我们还是按原来的规则开始吧）。,"Imagine, then, an economy that is closed to international trade.(This sounds archaic and way off the point in our current age of export-led economic miracles, and perhaps it is although I'll argue later that we may be able to modify the story to make it relevant to modern economies. But in any case, for the moment let's play by the original rules.)"
7118,通过对要素供给、技术、需求和市场结构做出假设，我们就可以描述这个假想经济了。,"Our hypothetical economy can be described by assumptions about factor supply, technology, demand, and market structure."
7119,事实上，城市并不是模型中的核心概念。,"Indeed, cities are not primitive concepts in the model."
7119,相反，单个厂商生产能力的规模报酬递增，运输成本和要素流动性等因素之间的相互作用导致了聚集现像的出现。,"Instead, agglomerations emerge from the interaction between increasing returns at the level of the individual production facility transportation costs, and factor mobility."
7119,由于规模报酬递增，每一种产品在有限几处集中生产更有利。,"Because of increasing returns, it is advantageous to concentrate production of each good at a few locations."
7120,页缘编码是指设计一份在每页的边缘都有编码数据的调査问卷。,Edge-coding involves designing a questionnaire with coding data along one side.
7120,编码记录在调査表中事先设计好的页边空白处或编码框中。,Codes are recorded in spaces in the margin or in code boxes already organised in the questionnaire.
7120,如图9 - 3所示，调查表的页边空白处印有编码框，此空白处用来提示编码员应把数据输人到哪一列。,The section of questionnaire shown in figure 9.3 has code boxes in the questionnaire and the margin is used to indicate to the coder into which column the data should be entered.
7120,知道了具体的数据应当输入的列，会使数据输入过程变得容易，同时，由于可及时识别列中的错误，还可以使数据的“净化”和核对过程变得容易。,"Knowing which column specific data have to be entered into assists the process of data entry.It also assists in the data cleaning and checking processes,as errors in columns can be identified quickly."
7120,在确定了适当的问题后，编码员可返回原始数据以检查哪部分发生了错误，然后以初始数据为基础做适当的修改。,The appropriate question is determined and the coder returns to the original data to examine where the error occurred and subsequently makes the appropriate changes based on the original data.
7121,我不得不离开那个自己称为家的空间，跨越边界流浪，然而我也需要回到那里……实际上，“家”的真正意义随着非殖民化和激进化的经验而发生变化。,"I had to leave that space I called home to move beyond boundaries, yet I needed also to return there....Indeed, the very meaning of ""home"" changes with the experience of decolonization, of radicalization."
7121,有时，家不是任何一个地方。,"At times, home is nowhere."
7121,有时，人们只知道极端的疏离与异化。,"At times, one knows only extreme estrangement and alienation."
7122,在进行假设检验的过程中，通常至少涉及两个变量——自变量和因变量。,"If you are testing a hypothesis, there will be at least two variables — an independent variable and a dependent variable."
7122,"实际上，“定量研究的语言就是变量和变量间关系的语言”（Neuman 2000, p. 126)。","In fact, '[t]he language of quantitative research is a language of variables and relationships among variables' (Neuman 2000, p. 126)."
7122,自变量有时也被称为原因变量（Neuman 2000)或改变变量（Kumar 1996)。,The independent variable is sometimes referred to as the causal variable (Neuman 2000) or change variable (Kumar 1996).
7122,因变量可解释为结果变量（Kumar 1996)。,The dependent variable is also referred to as the outcome variable (Kumar 1996).
7123,因果关系研究可能源于探索性研究或描述性研究。,Causal research may be generated from either exploratory or descriptive research.
7123,因果关系研究与定量研究方法之间的联系并不是模棱两可的，为了支持或推翻两个或多个变量之间的因果关系，运用这一研究方法时通常涉及变量的使用和假说的建立。,Causal research is unambiguously linked to the use of a quantitative methodology and involves the use of variables and the construction ofhypotheses to support or reject causal relationships between two or more variables.
7123,例如，研究者可能论证以下命题：在淡季，飞往省会城市的机票价格下降可能会提高该城市的游览率。,"For example, a researcher may consider the following statement:the lowering of airfares to capital cities in the low season will increase visitation rates to those cities."
7123,在这一命题中，研究者假设了前往省会城市的机票价格和游览率之间存在关联。,"In this statement, the researcher has hypothesised a relationship between the cost of airfares and visitation rates to capital cities."
7123,这是一个描述两个变量之间因果关系的假说，两个变量中一个是自变量机票价格降低，另一个是因变量游览率的上升。,"The statement is a hypothesis describing a causal relationship between two variables, an independent variable, the lowering of airfares (the cause variable), and the dependent variable, the increase in visitation rates (the effect variable)."
7124,建筑和规划文献从窗户、眺望处和视线的角度来对待隐私问题。这意思是说如果没有人能从外面窥视你的住处，那么你就拥有了隐私(privacy)。,"Architectural and planning literature deals with privacy in terms of windows, overlooks, sight lines.The idea is that if no one from outside can peek into where you live---behold, privacy."
7124,这是一种头脑简单的想法。,This is simple-minded.
7124,窗户里的隐私(privacy)是世上能够得到的最简单的商品。,Window privacy is the easiest commodity in the world to get.
7125,作为一个研究者，关于是否要进行隐性研究和适当地利用某种欺骗性的手段，你得自己拿定主意。,"As a researcher, you have to make your own decisions regarding covertresearch and the use of deception."
7125,这需要针对该项研究可能对社会产生的道德价值和利用欺骗、隐性研究会在多大程度上损害人的权利两方面进行权衡。,This should be determined by weighingthe 'moral' good such research will do for society against how such covertactivities and deception infringe on the rights of humans.
7125,同时也需要有一个来自你的学科、职业或组织的适当机构对此类行为予以许可。,"It also needs to be sanctioned by an appropriate body from your discipline, profession ororganisation."
7126,例如，我们现在就来探讨使萨默斯处理有毒垃圾的观点成为可能的普遍内容。,"Consider, for example, the general content in which Summers' version of what to do with toxic wastes becomes possible."
7126,在这里，强调它是新古典主义经济逻辑的典型表现，这是不够的。它本身是一组吸引人的特殊隐喻，在其中，人们可以设想在资源匮乏条件下进行提高福利的垃圾交易。,It is not sufficient here to argue that it is a typical manifestation of neoclassical economic logic — itself an engaging set of particular metaphors — in which welfare-enhancing trade in waste can be envisaged under conditions of resource-scarcity.
7127,所有研究的开展都必须要遵守一定的伦理规范。,All research must be undertaken in an ethical manner.
7127,对应用性研究来说更是如此，因为委托人可能会在研究设计或报告中倾向于某种偏见。,"This is especially relevant for applied research, as the client may angle for a bias in the research design or reporting."
7127,研究者是受道德标准约束的，因而这种倾向是不可接受的。,Researchers are bound by ethical standards and such angling is not acceptable.
7127,研究者在进行符合道德规范的研究时，必须对他们自己、学术界、公众和发起人负责。,"Researchers must be responsible to themselves, the scientific community , the public and their sponsors in conducting ethical research."
7128,人们讨论拥挤理论的同时，越来越关注城市设计与建筑给人类行为带来的负面影响。,"In addition to the general debate on crowding theory, a growing amount of attention has been directed towards the negative effects of the built environment on people’s behaviour."
7128,广义而言，这种影响是指建筑和空间的设计与构造有时会产生一种小环境，而这种小环境拒绝或否定社会互动的“正常形式”，而有助于各种各样的越轨行为。,In broad terms the suggestion is that the design and configuration of buildings and spaces sometimes creates micro-environments that discourage ‘normal’ patterns of social interaction and encourage deviant behaviour of various kinds.
7128,有大量的证据证实了这种观点。,A considerable amount of evidence has been accumulated in support of this idea.
7128,例如，有许多研究都论证到，高耸拥挤的楼房会对社会关系和孩子成长造成负面影响。,"The inhibiting effects of high-rise and deck-access apartment dwellings on social interaction and child development, for example, have been documented in a number of different studies."
7129,怀特海的“永恒性”学说牢牢地确定了这个观念。,"Whitehead's doctrine of ""permanences"" firms up the idea."
7129,“永恒性”作为一种“广泛联系”的体系源自过程。,"A ""permanence"" arises as a system of ""extensive connection"" out of processes."
7129,实体在它们的边界内以及它们创造空间之过程的内在秩序安排中获得相对稳定性，这是暂时的。,"Entities achieve relative stability in their bounding and their internal ordering of processes creating space, for a time."
7129,这些永恒以排他的方式最终占据一块空间(暂时的)，并因此定义一个位置——它们的位置(暂时的)。,Such permanences come to occupy a piece of a space in an exclusive way (for a time) and thereby define a place — their place — (for a time).
7129,位置形成过程是在创造空间的过程之流中开辟“永恒性”的过程。,"The process of place formation is a process of carving out ""permanences"" from the flow of processes creating spaces."
7129,但是“永恒性”——不管其看起来多么稳定一并非不灭的：它们总是作为“持续的消亡”而受时间支配。,"But the ""permanences"" — no matter how solid they may seem — are not eternal: they are always subject to time as ""perpetual perishing."""
7129,它们由创造、维持和消灭它们的过程而定。,"They are contingent on the processes that create, sustain and dissolve them."
7130,“垃圾”，特别是有害垃圾为什么以及如何被生产出来的，当然，这个问题从没有在萨默斯这类人的讨论中提及过。,"Questions of how and why ""wastes"" in general and hazardous wastes in particular are produced in the first place are, of course, never even mentioned in discussions of the Summers' sort."
7130,然而，正如考摩纳(1990)和其他人一起反复强调的[]，预防无疑应该优先于对任何副作用的处理和补救。,"Yet, as Commoner (1990) has, among others, again and again emphasized, the question of prevention surely should take precedence over disposal and cure of any side-effects."
7130,但是，提出那个问题需要将话语转移到更加充满政治色彩的批评地带，批评我们生活于其中的生产及消费方式的普遍特性。,But posing that question requires a discursive shift to the far more politically charged terrain of critique of the general characteristics of the mode of production and consumption in which we live.
7131,怀特海的最终目标是用“有机论哲学”代替牛顿的机械论观点，并且在《科学与近代世界》(1985:80)中，他通过重新研究时间和空间状况而开启了实现那个方案的道路。,"Whitehead's ultimate objective is to replace the Newtonian mechanistic view with ""a philosophy of organism"" and in Science and the Modern World (1985: 80) he opens the way to that project through a reconsideration of the status of space and time."
7131,他指出，物既是独立的，又是在时间和空间中绑在一起的。,He observes that things are both separated and bound together in space and time.
7131,他把这种特点称为时空之“分离性的”和“包容性的”特点。,"He calls these characters the ""separative"" and the ""prehensive"" characters of space-time."
7132,因此在系统和有机体(参见第8页）之间作类比是贴切的。,
7132,,"Activation of the links (flows of some type between elements) operates the system, so that the analogy between system and organism (see p. 8) is a close one."
7132,元素之间联系的性质不仅支配着系统的运转，而且在恰当的地方支配着系统的演化。,"The nature of the links between the elements governs not only the operation of the system but also, where relevant, its evolution."
7132,变化过程被纳入系统内部。,Processes of change are built into the system.
7133,焦点群体法也可用于预测数据的收集。,Focus groups can also be used to gather data for forecasting.
7133,预测过程通常包括收集数据，依据这些数据研究人员可以预测未来的事件及重大问题的发展。,Forecasting involves gathering data upon which the researcher is able to predict future events and issues.
7133,正如本教材前面提到的，预测可能包括短期（1天至两年）、中期（2至5年）、长期（5至15年）以及未来（15年以上）的预测（Mill & Morrison 1998)。,"As noted earlier in this textbook, forecasts can be short term (one day to two years), medium term (two to five years), long term (five to 15 years) and futuristic (more than 15 years) (Mill & Morrison 1998)."
7134,进行域分析包括以下步骤（Spradley 1980，pp.93 ~99):•选择语义关系，例如：(1)语义关系：严格包含；(2)形式:A是B的一种；举例：巴士观光是度假的一种。,"There are a number of steps involved in conducting domain analysis (Spradley 1980, pp. 93-99):• choose a semantic relationship, for example:1.Semantic relationship: strict inclusion2.Form: A is a kind of B3."
7134,•制作一张域分析工作表(参见下面的例子）。•选择一组数据；•检验数据中符合“语义关系”的“概括性术语”和“内含性术语”；•重新检验数据，找出其他的语义关系；•为已确定的域做目录。,Example: a bus tour is a kind of holiday• organise a domain analysis worksheet (see example below)  • choose a selection of data• examine the data for 'cover terms' and 'included terms' that match the 'semantic relationship'• re-examine the data for other semantic relationships• prepare a catalogue of identified domains.
7135,这样一个世界中会出现我们实际上看到的空间分布非常不均匀的经济活动吗？在实际世界中，大多数人聚居在面积很小的城市里，而城市本身也是高度专业化的。,"Would such a world give rise to the highly uneven spatial distribution of economic activity we actually see, in which most people live on the small urbanized fraction of the land, and in which urban areas themselves are highly specialized?"
7135,答案当然是否定的。,"The answer, of course, is that it would not."
7135,因为这是一个不存在任何扭曲的帕累托有效的世界，因而有效的结果（同时也是市场结果）必然是在整个平原上每一种产品的生产都均匀分布，这样无须运输。,"The efficient thing (and also the market outcome, since this would be an undistorted, Pareto-efficient world) would be to have production of every commodity spread evenly across the plain, so that no transportation is necessary."
7136,当然，随着时间的推移，经济学已越来越数学化了。,"Economics has, of course, become vastly more mathematical over time."
7136,不管怎么说，即使在那个时代发展经济学的风格也很落伍。,"Nonetheless, development economics was archaic in style even for its own time."
7136,在超发展理论最著名的四篇论文中，罗森斯坦—罗丹的那篇文章基本上与萨缪尔森 （Samuelson）将赫克歇尔—俄林理论模型化的工作属于同一时期，而刘易斯、缪尔达尔和赫希曼的文章几乎与索罗对增长理论的最初论述同时问世。,"Of the four most famous high development works, Rosenstein-Rodan's was approximately contemporary with Samuelson's formulation of the Heckscher-Ohlin model, while Lewis, Myrdal,and Hirschman were all roughly contemporary with Solow's initial statement of growth theory."
7137,审查后的摘要也可拓展成文并最终发表在会议论文集中。,Refereed abstracts may also develop into full papers that are printed inconference proceedings.
7137,一些会议论文集中的文章也可以在期刊上发表。,Some papers in conference proceedings may alsobe requested or submitted for consideration for publication in journals.
7137,期刊论文的审查过程要比会议论文的过程更为严格和耗时。,Thejournal review process is more demanding and time-consuming than the process for conference papers.
7138,然而，这些对真实性的十分错误的认识已经成为民族主义这一20世纪最强大和最危险的力量的基础。,"Yet, such assumptions of authenticity have been the basis for feelings of nationalism --- one of the most powerful and dangerous forces of the twentieth century."
7138,此外，在国家内部，种族主义观念继续作为城市冲突的根源而存在。,"Furthermore, within nations, racist notions continue to be the basis for urban conflict."
7138,因此，著作者们已经开始分析那些支撑种族主义在英国的一些内城地区存在的帝国主义话语。,Some writers have begun to analyze the imperialist discourses that underpin the racism that is found in some parts of British cities.
7138,正如霍尔所说，那些反对亚洲人迁人的人们忽视了导致英国城市中这些群体发展的漫长的帝国历史。,"As Hall points out, those who object to the influx of ‘Asians’ forget the long history of empire that has led to the evolution of these groups in British cities."
7139,深度访谈本质上是主观的，这种方法能够收集到丰富而深人的资料，而且可能要分阶段进行。,"In-depth interviews are subjective in nature, allow for rich and in-depth data to be collected and may involve several sessions."
7139,非结构化访谈并没有正式的访谈程序表或事先预定的问题，持续时间长。,Unstructured interviews do not have a formal interview schedule or set of questions and are long in duration.
7139,非结构化访谈类似于谈话。,Unstructured interviews are akin to a conversation.
7139,非结构化访谈的优缺点与整体—归纳范式的本体论、认识论和方法论观点相关。,"The advantages and disadvantages of unstructured interviews are related to the holistic-inductive paradigms' ontological, epistemological and methodological perspectives."
7140,但是，对自然的统治和对他者的统治之间的这种联系还有更多的维度。,But this connection between the domination of nature and the domination of others has a further dimension.
7140,任何种类的“改造自然”计划都具有分布性后果，许多此类明显不公正研究都是急烈冲突的根源。,"""Nature-transforming"" projects of any sort have distributional consequences and the patent inequity of many of these has been the source of powerful conflicts."
7140,当前，在环境正义运动和名为“穷人的环境保护主义”运动的多国组织中，这些都成为斗争的焦点(参阅本书第十三章)。,"These are now the focus of struggle in the environmental justice movement and within a polyglot group of movements known as ""the environmentalism of the poor"" (see chapter 13)."
7141,绘制是一种具体体现权力的话语行为。,Mapping is a discursive activity that incorporates power.
7141,在所有方式中选定一种方式来绘制世界的权力是一种至关重要的政治斗争工具。,The power to map the world in one way rather than another is a crucial tool in political struggles.
7141,因此，围绕绘制的权力斗争(同样，无论这些地图是所谓“真实的”还是比喻的空间)是话语生产的基本环节。,"Power struggles over mapping (again, no matter whether these are maps of so-called real"" or metaphorical spaces) are therefore fundamental moments in the production of discourses."
7142,社会科学研究人类社会和人类活动。它包括像社会学、经济学和政治学这样的学科。,"Social science is the study of human society and activity; its member disciplines include economics, political science and sociology."
7142,战后时期该领域应用科学分析方法解决真实世界的问题，得到了迅速的扩展。,"These social sciences expanded rapidly after 1945, using scientific methods to analyse problems and suggest how they may be solved."
7142,1970年代以前罕有人文地理学家认为自己的研究领域属于社会科学，但是现在许多人改变了看法。,"Before the 1970s few human geographers identified their discipline as a social science, but many now do."
7143,其中，核心的概念之一就是个人之间为了城市中理想的区位而进行的非个人竞争（impersonal competition)。,One of the central concepts was that of impersonal competitionbetween individuals for favourable locations within the city.
7143,这种竞争基本上通过市场机制进行 ，其结果就是使土地租金产生一种特征化的模式。不同地点和条件的土地租金不一样，又因为不同的人支付地租的能力不同，从而在不同类型的人群之间造成隔离（segregation)。,"This struggle was acted out primarily through market mechanisms, resulting in a characteristic pattern of land rents and the consequent segregation of different types of people according to their ability to meet the rents associated with different sites and situations."
7143,因此，经济分异被看做是导致居住隔离的基本原因，而特定群体在某些地区上的支配(dominance)被归因于其相对竞争力。,"Economic differentiation was thus seen as the basic mechanism of residential segregation, and the local dominance of a particular group was ascribed to its relative competitive power."
7144,首先来看一看美国工作场所安全和制定规章实践及实施的一般历史。,"Consider, first, the general history of workplace safety and of regulatory practices and enforcements in the United States."
7144,围绕着诸如三角女式衬衫公司火灾事件所引发的工人斗争极为重要地把职业安全和保健置入20世纪20年代的政治议程之中。在不放弃商业利益的前提下，努力满足某些最低限度的要求，这就是罗斯福新政联盟(包括工会)的一个根本特点。,"Labor struggles around events such as the Triangle Shirtwaist Company fire put occupational safety and health very much upon the political agenda during the 1920s and it was a fundamental feature of Roosevelt's New Deal coalition, which included the labor unions, to try to satisfy some minimum requirements on his score without alienating business interests."
7145,通过将编码的数据组成频数分布，研究者得以使用集中趋势量数来进一步分析数据。,"Having organised the coded data into frequency distributions, the researcher is able to comment further on the data by using measures of central tendency."
7145,集中趋势量数能够使调查者以一个数字来报告结果（在此情况下指的是频数分布）。,Measures of central tendency are used to enable researchers to report on the results (in this case frequency distributions) as one number.
7145,集中趋势量数——众数、中位数和算术平均数——与具体的测量层次有关。,"The measures of central tendency — mode, median and mean — are associated with specific levels of measurement."
7146,郊区的兴起是十足由美国领导的社会转变过程，代表了一种有时被称为美国霸权周期的元素。,The rise of the suburb was very much a US-led process of social change and represents an element of what is sometimes called the American hegemonic cycle.
7146,这是沃勒斯坦主义周期性意识形态时空概念的一部分。,This is part of a Wallersteinian cyclical-ideological TimeSpace.
7146,在世界系统分析中，现代世界已经通过3个霸权周期而发展，每个周期都是以世界性霸权国家经济上的成功为基础的。,"In world-systems analysis, the modern world-system has developed through three hegemonic cycles each based upon the economic successes of a world hegemonic state."
7147,抽样基本上分为概率抽样和非概率抽样。,Sampling is primarily either non-probability or probability based.
7147,非概率抽样包括就近抽样、目标式抽样、滚雪球抽样和专家抽样。,"Non-probability sampling includes convenience, purposive, snowball sampling and expert sampling."
7147,概率抽样包括简单随机抽样（抽签方法、名称方法、出生日期或电脑方法）、系统抽样、分层抽样和多阶整群抽样。,"Non-probability sampling includes simple random sampling (lottery method, first name, date of birth or computer-generated methods), stratified sampling, cluster sampling and multi-stage sampling."
7148,使用转换表很浪费时间。它先将数据转换成编码，然后输入到转换表上，再将编码输人到计算机软件程序中使用统计方法进行分析。,"The use of transfer sheets takes some time, transferring data into codes and onto a transfer sheet and then entering the codes into a computer software program to statistically analyse the coded data."
7148,这个过程包括了数据处理的三个阶段，随着每一个阶段的深人，编码发生错误的可能性也随之增加。,This involves three stages of data handling and the potential for coding errors increases with each stage of handling.
7149,设想用(点)雨量计和(全面布设的)降雨雷达对降雨的测量；要用前者的测量值校正后者，在得到一个“真实”数值之前就需要进行大量的采样作业。,Consider the measurement of rainfall using (point) raingauge data and (spatially-distributed) rainfall radar; calibrating the latter with measurements from the former requires an extensive sampling exercise before an approximation to a ‘true’ value can be defined.
7149,尽管如此，使用摄影测量法产生数字化地形模(DTMs)已经导致对精密度和准确度的重视。,"Nevertheless, the use of photogrammetric methods to derive digital terrain models (DTMs) has led to increasing emphasis on precision and accuracy."
7149,由于DTM提供有关地球表面地形的三维信息，所以它也是很有意义的。,The DTM is also interesting because it provides three-dimensional information on the morphology of the earth’s surface.
7150,作为劳动价值的表现形式，货币承担着这些价值流通的尺度和媒介功能。,"As an expression of labor values, money operates as both measure and as medium of circulation of those values."
7150,（抽象的）交换价值不同于货币的(具体的)使用价值方面，但将之内化了。,The (abstract) exchange value differs from but internalizes the (concrete) use value aspects of money.
7150,只有一部分货币才能被直接用作资本(尽管大多数货币迟早会被带入其轨道）,Only a portion of the total money is used directly as capital (though most money at some time or another is brought within its orbit).
7151,在马克思主义者看来，不能将理论与实践分离开来；认识引导变革的程序。,"To Marxists, theory cannot be separated from practice; understanding leads to a programme for change."
7151,但马克思主义地理学家应该如何工作以实现从资本主义到社会主义的革命，对此很多人并不清楚。,"How Marxist geographers should work to achieve a revolution, from capitalism to socialism, is not made clear by many."
7151,批判理论认为，对此的认同显然应该是渐进的过程（见下文），马克思主义分析所指出的对现实作正确评价，将增强自我反映的力量并导致从控制中解放出来。,"The consensus would appear to be the gradualist one suggested by critical theory (see below), whereby appreciation of reality as depicted by Marxist analysis will increase the powers of self-reflection and lead to emancipation from domination."
7152,例如，英国最重要的、也是最引人注目的资产变卖是在第六章所讨论的地方当局住房的变卖。,"For example, one of the most important manifestations of asset sales in the United Kingdom has been the sale of local authority housing, as discussed in Chapter 6."
7152,私有化也可能采用协议出让的形式，将原先由公共部门承担的责任转给私人组织。,Privatization can also take the form of contracting-out --- awarding tasks that were previously undertaken by the public sector to private sector organizations.
7152,通常这样的转让是基于被称为竞争性投标的私下协议。,Often these contracts are awarded on the basis of secret bidding known as competitive tendering.
7153,资料三角校正是指研究者在研究过程引入多种资料来源。,Researchers concerned with data triangulation draw on various sources of data in the research process.
7153,调查者三角校正是指研究中雇用若干个研究者或评论者。,Investigator triangulation refers to the employment of several researchers or evaluators in a study.
7153,理论三角校正是指研究者用几种方法或视角分析资料。,Theory triangulation involves researchers using several theories or perspectives to analyse data.
7153,方法论的三角校正是指研究者使用多种方法收集与研究相关的资料。,Methodological triangulation involves researchers using several methods to gather data relevant to a study.
7154,"实际上，“定量研究的语言就是变量以及变量间关系的语言”（Neuman 2000, p. 126)。","In fact, 'the language of quantitative research is a language of variables and relationships among variables’(Neuman 2000, p. 126)."
7154,自变量有时也被称为原因变量（Neuman 2000)或改变变量（Kumar 1996)。,The independent variable is sometimes referred to as the causal variable (Neuman 2000) or change variable (Kumar 1996).
7154,因变量可解释为结果变量（Kumar 1996)。,
7154,,The dependent variable is also referred to as the outcome variable (Kumar 1996).
7155,因此，把马克思主义同那种相当自负的统治自然的观点剥离开来，被证明十分困难。,It has subsequently proven hard to wean Marxism away from a rather hubristic view of the domination of nature thesis.
7155,此外，马克思主义同多数资产阶级社会科学一样都普遍地厌恶那种观点，即“自然”能够控制、决定甚或限制任何形式的人类努力。,"In addition, Marxism has shared with much of bourgeois social science a general abhorrence of the idea that ""nature"" can control, determine, or even limit any kind of human endeavor."
7155,这样，它要么完全回避对任何根本性的自然观的定义，要么诉诸一种过于简化的修辞——“自然的人性化”，这种修辞得到辩证的和历史的唯物主义的支持，后者总是通过诉诸一系列认识论的/本体论的原则来理解那个难题。,"In so doing it has either avoided a definition of any foundational view of nature altogether, or resorted to a rather too simplistic rhetoric about ""the humanization of nature"" backed by a dialectical and historical materialism that somehow absorbed the problem by appeal to a set of epistemological/ontological principles."
7156,邮寄调査采用自填式问卷。与上门调査相比，它可以使研究者以较小的成本收集地域范围更广的数据。,Mail surveys are self-completion questionnaires that enable the researcher to target a wide geographical area for a lesser cost than a household survey.
7156,邮寄调査需要使用封面信、指导语、问卷本身和用于寄回的信封。,"Mail surveys involve the use of a covering letter, an ethics consent form, the questionnaire itself and a return envelope ."
7157,解放(常常是一种集体计划)和自我实现(多半是个人化的)是一对不可分离但常常矛盾的孪生目标。,The twin aims of emancipation (often a collective project) and self-realization (for the most part individualized) were inseparable but frequently contradictory.
7157,因为统治自然的主题从属于这两者，它也使矛盾内在化了。,"Since the thesis of domination of nature attached to both, it, too, internalized contradictions."
7157,这一点要经过很长一段时间才变得清晰可见。,But it took time for them to become apparent.
7157,最初，人们把公共领域的解放当成自我实现的前提，同时把个体解放视为集体解放目标的适当手段。,"Initially, emancipation in the public sphere was quite properly viewed as a precondition for self-realization, while individual self-realization was viewed as a proper means to collective emancipatory ends."
7157,并且假设理性总是能够把两者统一起来。,And it was presumed that reason could always unite the two.
7158,11.探究“可能世界”是辩证思维的有机组成部分。,"11. The exploration of ""possible worlds"" is integral to dialectical thinking."
7158,在某种意义上，这种观念回到了被17世纪科学广泛拒斥的亚里士多德的观念，即“一个自然存在的生成是其潜能实现的持续过程”(Leclerc，1986:21)。,"In some ways this idea goes back to Aristotle, broadly rejected by seventeenth-century science, that ""the becoming of a natural being is a constant process of actualization of its potentiality"" (Leclerc, 1986: 21)."
7158,马克思辩证思维的根本主题是探究各种潜能：变化、自我实现，建构新的集体认同和社会秩序，以及新的总体性(如社会生态系统)等潜能。,"The exploration of potentialities for change, for self-realization, for the construction of new collective identities and social orders, new totalities (e.g., social ecosystems), and the like is a fundamental motif in Marxism dialectical thinking."
7159,这种情况出现在20世纪50年代的纽约，其时纽约出台了一项新法规，要求在出租房和公寓中提供集中供暖。,"This was discovered in New York City during the 1950's, after new laws required central heating in tenement buildings."
7159,如果房东和业主改善条件的话，他们可以通过提高租费和退税来得到补偿。,Landlords were to be recompensed for the improvements by renting increases or tax abatements.
7159,但是这项条例遭遇了意想不到的障碍，尤其是那些本不该有问题的地方。,"The arrangement ran into unexpected obstacles, and precisely in places where no particular obstacles would have been anticipated."
7160,对于阿多诺来说，世界完全是相对的。,For Adorno the world is thoroughly relational.
7160,每一个物都是它同其他物的关系的“结晶”。,"Each thing is a ""crystallization"" of its relation with others."
7160,然而，“结晶”这个术语在此与“关系”一样重要。,"Yet the language of ""crystallization"" is as important here as that of ""relation""."
7160,相对的世界并非一个纯粹流动与和谐的世界，而是这样一个世界：物在其中结晶成高密度的、无限特殊的、往往非常顽固的实体，它们抵制着自己诞生于其中的周围世界。,"The relational world is not one of pure fluidity and harmony, but one where things crystallize into highly dense, infinitely specific, and often very recalcitrant entities that resist the surrounding world in which they are born."
7161,阿尔贝蒂以两种方式拓展了色诺芬的观点。,Alberti extends Xenophon's argument in two ways.
7161,首先，“封闭”和控制全部身体功能，这有助于保证单个身体的边界，创造一种不被渗透的纯粹性和个体性的空间。古列维奇对中世纪自我的研究说明了该问题。,"First, the ""closeting off"" and control of all bodily functions helps secure a boundary of the isolated body, establishing spaces of purity and individuality that are protected from the porosity that characterized, for example, Gurevich's account of the medieval self."
7161,其次，性欲在家庭（内部的卧室空间）中的私密化变得重要。,"Secondly, the privatization of sexuality within the household (the interior space of bedrooms) becomes important."
7162,在整体-归纳范式和假设-演绎范式指导下的案例研究，其数据收集的方法种类繁多。,Data collection for case studies operating within the holistic-inductive paradigm and the hypothetico-deductive paradigm are based on multiple methods.
7162,具体而言，基于整体-归纳范式的案例研究通常采用文献法、参与观察法以及访谈法来收集资料。,"Case studies informed by the holistic-inductive paradigm use the documentary method, participant observation and interviewing."
7162,相应地，定性的案例研究往往采用方法论三角校正。,"Subsequently, qualitative case studies use methodological triangulation."
7163,这个问题同对理性/非理性的探讨紧紧地联系在一起。,This question was tightly coupled with considerations of rationality/ irrationality.
7163,法兰克福学派挑战了工具理性的霸权，并且寻求一种替代性理性，这种理性有能力赋予生活一种深刻的意义，有能力恢复人类与外部自然之间敏感而开放的辩证关系，而不会向浪漫主义愤怒，宗教意识形态、自然崇拜和邪恶神话之盲目力量屈服。,"The Frankfurt School challenged the hegemony of instrumental rationality and sought in its place an alternative rationality that had the power to give a deeper sense of meaning to life, to recuperate a sensuous and open dialogical relation between human beings and external nature without giving in to what they saw as the blind forces of romantic fury, religious ideology, nature idolatory and satanic myth."
7163,当然，如何做到这一点仍然是一个未决的问题。,"How to do that is still, of course, a very open question."
7164,霸权周期及其相关的常规现代性，是社会时间形态的经典例子。,Hegemonic cycles with their associated everyday modernities are a classic example of a morphology of social time.
7164,作为一种周期性变化的模式，霸权周期反对简单的进步模型，后者假定一种线性发展的格局。,As a cyclical model of change they counter simple progress models that assume a linear pattern of advancement.
7164,但是，这并非不连续性优于连续性的案例。,"However, this is not a case of discontinuity over continuity."
7165,生态党的（Eco-cratic)观点喜欢普遍主义的生态规则，正像发展主义者喜欢普遍主义的经济学规则一样。,"The eco-cratic view likes universalist ecological rules, just as the developmentalist liked universalist economic rules."
7165,两者都忽视当地社群管理他们的资源并建造一个有意义社会的权利。,Both pass over the rights of local communities to be in charge of their resources and to build a meaningful society.
7165,保护自然[应该]与下列这些权利密切相关：公有产权、传统认识方式、文化自主、宗教仪式，以及不受以国家为中心的发展的束缚。,"The conservation of nature [should be] intimately related to rights of communal ownership, traditional ways of knowing, cultural autonomy, religious rivals, and freedom from state-centered development."
7165,（Sachs，1993),
7166,房地产代理商负责与居住房产的交换和管理相关的各种各样的活动。,Real estate agents are responsible for a wide range of activities connected with the exchange and management of residential property.
7166,他们为购买者寻觅房屋，有时还替他们安排资金；他们为出售者吸引买家，替他们处理文书工作。,They find houses and sometimes arrange finance for buyers; they attract purchasers and transact paperwork for sellers.
7166,另外，他们也可能做一些调査、拍卖、评估、房地产管理和保险的业务。,"In addition, they may also be involved in surveying, auctioneering, valuation, property management and insurance."
7167,另一方面，这种公司组织有钱，因此有能力取代他们的竞争对手，占有他们想要的地方。,"In the second place, such organizations have money, and thus are able to supplant most rivals for the space they want."
7167,因此，在圆丘上安顿下来这种愿望和能力在银行和保险公司以及著名公司的办公间上得到了最有效的体现。后者可以 从银行和保险公司(insurance companies)那里很方便地借到钱。,"The wish and the ability to settle on the knoll are thus combined most effectively in banks and insurance companies, and in prestige offices---which borrow readily from banks and insurance companies."
7168,"弗林德斯(1992, in Miles &Huberman 1994, P. 289 )提出了另一种关于伦理学方法的观点。","Flinders (1992, in Miles & Huberman 1994, p. 289) presents another view regarding approaches to ethics."
7168,他给出了四种类型的伦理学方法：关系伦理学（与附属、尊敬和照顾相关）；功利伦理学（也适用于实证主义）；义务伦理学（认为研究者与被研究者之间是一种合作关系）；生态伦理学（与了解当地文化和避免背离相关）。,"Flinders identifies four types of approaches to ethics: relational ethics (associated with attachment, respect and caring); utilitarian ethics (as applied in positivism); deontological ethics (viewing the researcher and the researched as collaborators); and ecological ethics (associated with understanding the local culture and avoiding detachment)."
7168,这四种方法对研究过程的三个主要领域——接近参与者、收集资料和报告调查结果——持有不同的观点（参见表4-5)。,"Each of these four approaches has ramifications for three main areas of the overall research process: accessing participants, collecting the data and reporting the findings (see table 4.5)."
7169,研究人员应该注意，编码可能被过度使用。,Researchers need to be aware that coding can be overdone.
7169,特别是在编码的过程中，如果没有使用备忘录记录想要实现的目标，编码过于细致会导致“只见树木，不见森林”。,"You can code to such a micro level of detail that you 'cannot see the forest for the trees', especially if you have not been keeping memos of what you are trying to achieve with the coding process you are conducting."
7169,因此，为便于追踪，不要忘记制定一张路径图（将在本章的制图法部分进行详细介绍）。,"Therefore, make sure you keep a map of the path you are trying to follow with your codes (this is addressed in more detail in the section on mapping later in the chapter)."
7170,在研究围绕雅典卫城的竞争性论述和想象时，洛卡奇(1967)实施的恰恰就是这样一个步骤。,This is exactly the move that Loukaki (1967) makes in her study of competing treatments and visions of the Acropolis over time.
7170,就“谁的精神定义哪个场所的性质”而进行的政治权力斗争贯穿于希腊历史。在这种斗争面前，建筑师、考古学家和艺术史家围绕“如何理解场所精神”的话语争论就渐渐消退了。,"Discursive controversies among architects, archeologists, and art historians over how to understand the genius loci here fade before the political power struggle coursing through Greek history as to whose genius gets to define the qualities of which loci."
7170,如洛卡奇表明的那样，那种争论不只是围绕着正确地解释过去以及这种或那种集体记忆的本真性进行，而且也是围绕全部的未来希望进行。,"And that contest, as Loukaki shows, is not simply about the proper interpretation of the past, the authenticity of this or that collective memory, but it is also about all hopes for the future."
7171,比较优势的概念可以用发生在地区内两部分之间的贸易模型来解释。,The notion of comparative advantage can be explained with a simple model of trade between two parts of the region.
7171,假设西部地区比东部地区具有更高的生产力。,Suppose that the western half of the region is more productive than the eastern half.
7171,在表2-1中，西部在生产小麦和毛料上均具有绝对优势（absolute advantage）。西部居民每小时生产的小麦是东部居民的2倍，生产的毛料是东部居民的6倍。,"In Table 2-1, the West has an absolute advantage in producing both wheat and cloth: western residents produce twice as much wheat per hour and six times as much cloth per hour."
7172,贝尔•胡克斯强调:“这不是一种神秘的边缘性观点。它来自活生生的经验”。,"""This is not,"" Bell Hooks insists, ""a mythic notion of marginality. It comes from lived experience."""
7172,边缘不只是一种比喻，而且是一种具有真实基础的想象。,"The margin is not simply a metaphor, but an imaginary that has real underpinnings."
7172,从那个地点出发，人们可以有力地谴责那些在中心地带形成的所谓的解放性话语。,From that location a powerful condemnation of supposedly emancipatory discourses shaped at the center can be launched.
7173,"研究人员应该注意,编码可能被过度使用。",Researchers need to be aware that coding can be overdone.
7173,特别是在编码的过程中，如果没有使用备忘录记录想要实现的目标，编码过于细致会导致“只见树木，不见森林”。,"You can codeto such a micro level of detail that you 'cannot see the forest for the trees',especially if you have not been keeping memos of what you are trying to achieve with the coding process you are conducting."
7173,因此，为便于追踪，不要忘记制定一张路径图（将在本章的制图法部分进行详细介绍）。,"Therefore, make sure you keep a map of the path you are trying to follow with your codes (this is addressed in more detail in the section on mapping later in the chapter)."
7174,就像上文提到的，数据输入有多种方法可资使用。,"As already noted above, there are a number of ways that data can beentered."
7174,数据输入的轻松与否将取决于在调査设计阶段，调查者是否对数据分析过程给予了全面的考虑。,The ease of data entry will depend on the researcher giving fullconsideration to the data analysis phase in the research design stage.
7174,举个例子，如果调查问卷的设计包含了数据编码，那么就有可能立刻输人数据；否则，就需要准备编码簿，并且数据输人还要求数据输入人员在调查问卷和计算机程序之间互相参照（这也增加了在数据输入过程中犯错误的概率）。,"It ispossible, for example, to enter data immediately from the questionnaire ifdata codes are included in the questionnaire design.Otherwise, code booksneed to be prepared and data entry will require some cross-referencingbetween the questionnaire and the computer program by the data entryperson (which also increases the chances of possible errors in data entry)."
7175,通过“把面对面直接交流的社会设定成理想，社群主义理论家制造了未来‘本真的，社会和我们生活其中的‘非本真’社会之间的二元论，后者只体现为异化、官僚化和堕落”。,"By positing ""a society of immediate face-to-face relations as ideal, community theorists generate a dichotomy between the `authentic' society of the future and the `inauthentic' society we live in, which is characterized only by alienation, bureaucratization and degradation."""
7175,扬对海德格尔传统的批判是非常激烈的。,Young's criticism of the Heideggerian tradition is strong.
7175,“种族主义、种性沙文主义和阶级贬值……部分地是由对社群的渴望发展起来的”。,"""Racism, ethnic chauvinism, and class devaluation ... grow partly from the desire for community."""
7176,正如派菲伦（1999，P.3)所言，“在把口头叙述整理成文本的过程中，可能会丢失大量信息，因此对于口头资料来源一定要明确注明属于口头资料来源”。,"As Pamphilon (1999, p. 3) comments, 'so much can be lost when an oral account is transcribed into text, it is crucial that oral sources are always acknowledged as oral sources'."
7176,在口头互动中，研究人员的角色非常重要。,The role of the researcher in oral inter- actions is important.
7176,"正如本书前面所提到的，在非实证主义范式中，研究人员需要确定在研究过程中自身的个人和“政治”角色（MacKinnon 1982, P. 20)。","As mentioned earlier in this textbook, in non-positivist paradigms, researchers need to identify their personal and 'political' role (MacKinnon 1982, p. 20) in the research act."
7176,变焦模型法的互动层次要求研究人员把自己也写进文本中。,The interactional level of the zoom model demands that researchers must write themselves into the text.
7177,标准差也用于计算z分数和t分数。,Standard deviation is also used to calculate z-scores and f-scores.
7177,这两个值使用标准化的数据计算，能够使不同的原始数据进行比较。,Both of these enable the comparison of raw scores from different distributions using calculations that standardise the scores.
7177,具体而言，“标准数据或者Z分数将原始数据从不同的分布变成同样的分布，它们有同样的平均值（平均值0），同样的标准差（标准差 l）”（Sarantakos 1998，p.3800）。,"Specifically, '[s]tandard scores or (z-scores) transform raw scores from different distributions into a common distribution, which has the same mean (a mean of zero) and the same standard deviation (a standard deviation of 1)' (Sarantakos 1998, p. 380)."
7178,地理学中的常见问题是如何将小尺度试验结果推广到更大的尺度。,A common problem in geography is how to generalize the results of small-scale experiments at the larger scale.
7178,布雷克兰德的例子显示了详细的空间取样的好处，但是由时间或者纯粹是由于过程研究的成本等原因，并不总能够这样做。,"The Breckland example showed the advantage of detailed spatial sampling but this may not always be possible, for reasons of time or the sheer cost of process studies."
7178,当然，从某一项研究中所得到的结果——实际上，是一个样本定要谨慎对待，这就导致了现场实验推广的某种不确定性。,"Of course, results from a single study – in effect, a sample of one – must always be treated with great caution, and this has led to some uncertainty about the wider value of field experiments."
7179,作为话语，生态现代化把冲突内在化了。,"As a discourse, ecological modernization internalizes conflict."
7179,它具有大众优势，严肃地关注环境—生态问题，特别是捜集环境影响人口的科学证据，但它并不挑战与环境问题对立的资本主义经济体系。,"It has a radical populist edge, paying serious attention to environmental-ecological issues and most particularly to the accumulation of scientific evidence of environmental impacts on human populations, without challenging the capitalist economic system head on."
7179,不过，它确实暗示了对私有财产权的严格调控，并且，只要它付诸行动，通过调控，就能实际地抑制不受控制的资本积累的潜能。,"It does imply strict regulation of private property rights, however, and in so far as it leads to action it can de facto, through regulatory action, curb the possibilities for uncontrolled capital accumulation."
7180,对于实证主义范式，文献综述要在资料收集之前进行。,"In a positivist paradigm, the literature review will be undertaken prior to any data collection."
7180,资料收集在文献综述的指导下进行。,The data collection will be guided by the literature review.
7180,然而，对于解释社会学范式或女性主义范式来说，文献综述可能在资料收集后进行。,"However, in an interpretive social sciences paradigm or a feminist perspective paradigm, the literature review may be undertaken after data collection."
7180,当研究者使用草根理论进行分析时更是如此，因为这种分析“植根于”（来自于）被研究者的日常生活，是对那些存在问题或值得研究的日常生活的分析。,"This would be especially the case if the researcher were using grounded theory analysis, which is 'grounded' (derived) in the everyday world of the people being studied and what they perceive as issues or worth researching."
7180,在运用草根理论进行分析之前，研究者应该对有关的方法论文献进行评述。,"Prior to conducting grounded theory analysis, the researcher would conduct a methodological literature review."
7181,场所精神是一个罗马概念。,Genius loci is a Roman concept.
7181,根据古罗马的信仰，每一个“独立的”存在都具有自己的精神特色，它的守护神。,"According to ancient Roman belief every ""independent"" being has its genius, its guardian spirit."
7181,这种神使人和地方具有生命，伴随着它们从出生到死亡，并决定着它们的个性或本质。,"This spirit gives life to people and places, accompanies them from birth to death, and determines their character or essence."
7182,关系的内在化并不意味着这些关系的非异化形式，虽然它确实引起了对全部异化理论的质疑。异化理论总是假定一个事先就获得的自我本质，我们违背并且需要返回这个本质（参阅本书第八章）。,"The internalization of relations does not imply a nonalienated form of such relations, though it does throw into question any theory of alienation that presupposes some preformed essence of self that gets violated and which needs to be returned to (cf chapter 8)."
7182,虽然身体可以把这种过程的结果内化，但它恰恰因为自己的异化而不能独自地衡量、评价和理解它自己通过城市化而进行的生产的动态。,"While the body may internalize the effects of such process it is not by itself able to measure, assess, and understand the dynamics of its own production through urbanization precisely because of its alienation."
7183,城市化经济导致来自不同产业的企业在城市里集聚。,Urbanization economies cause firms from different industries to cluster in cities.
7183,城市里的企业可以利用提供商务服务（机械修理、银行、保险、运输、就业代理）和地方公共服务（运输机构、学校）的规模经济效应。,"The firms in cities exploit scale economies in the provision of business services (machine repair, banking, insurance, transportation, employment agencies) and local public services (transportation facilities, schools)."
7183,城市里的企业同样也可以从市场共享和知识外溢效应中获益。,Firms in cities may also benefit from labor-market pooling and knowledge spillovers.
7184,第二次把空间纳入经济学的重大努力有一个更为谨慎的目标，因而相应地它在迈入经济学领域时也更为成功；不过最终它还是失败了。,"The second big effort to bring space into economics was more modest in its goals, and correspondingly far more successful in its initial entry into the field; yet in the end it, too, failed."
7184,我指的是在20世纪60年代末和70年代初曾风光一时的“新城市经济学”。,"I refer to the ""new urban economics"" that flourished in the late 1960s and early 1970s."
7184,这方面的文献研究的是城市的内部空间结构。,
7184,,This was a literature that concerned itself with the internal spatial structure of cities.
7185,那么主流经济学是如何对待空间问题的呢？置之不理。,And so how did the mainstream cope with spatial issues?
7185,主流经济学家从不考虑区位问题在我们的日常生活中一直很重要，也不考虑在现实世界中，城市系统像经济学中其他任何系统一样有章可循。,"By ignoring them.Never mind that the importance of location confronts us continually in daily life, or for that matter that urban systems exhibit empirical regularities as strong as any in economics."
7185,正如地理学家们因为知道手中没有可以解释山脉成因的模型，所以不会认真研究山脉的位置那样，经济学家们也因为知道无法把空间因素模型化，而不去研究经济的空间方面的问题。,"Like geologists who could not really look at where mountain ranges are located because they knew they had no model of mountain formation, economists avoided looking at the spatial aspect of economies because they knew they had no way to model that aspect."
7186,霍华德对美国城市规划的影响集中在城镇(小城市)和区域规划者以及建筑师两个方面。,"Howard's influence on American city planning converged on the city from two directions: from town and regional planners on the one hand, and from architects on the other."
7186,帕特里克•格迪斯爵士这位苏格兰生物学家和哲学家沿着这种规划思路，不把花园城市概念看成是一种吸引人口增长的方法(而原本这些人口注定是要涌向 大城市的），而是看成是一种通向更庞大的、容纳更多的方式的起点。,"Along the avenue of planning, Sir Patrick Geddes, a Scots biologist and philosopher, saw the Garden City idea not as a fortuitous way to absorb population growth otherwise destined for a great city, but as the starting point of a much grander and more encompassing pattern."
7186,他是从整个区域规划的角度来考虑城市的规划的。,He thought of the planning of cities in terms of the planning of whole regions.
7187,持续比较分析使得研究人员能够通过持续比较已编码的数据来建立范畴。,Constant comparative analysis enables researchers to develop categories through constantly comparing coded data.
7187,结果，通过反复出现的频率和理论抽样的方法可以识别和检验与编码相似的数据。,"As a result, like-coded data are identified and verified through their repetitive presence and by the process of theoretical sampling."
7187,"在对已编码数据概念命名时，斯特劳斯和考宾（1990, PP. 68 ~ 69)建议研究人员不要使用“外来语'”因为它们常常含有先入为主的或特定的含义，因而推荐使用“本土的”概念。","When naming coded data concepts, Strauss and Corbin (1990, pp. 68-9) advise researchers not to use 'borrowed concepts' as they often carry preconceived or loaded meanings.Instead ' in vivo' concepts are recommended."
7187,"格雷泽(1978，P.70)和斯特劳斯（1987，p.33)提出了“本土”这一术语,意味着研究的参与者应用自己的语言构建概念术语，而不是由研究人员来创造概念术语。","Glaser (1978, p. 70) and Strauss (1987, p. 33) coined the term ' in vivo', meaning concepts that are named by the study participants themselves in their own words, rather than researcher-contrived concept terms."
7187,持续比较分析与渐进法非常相似。,Constant comparative analysis is not unlike successive approximation.
7188,抽样基本上分为概率抽样和非概率抽样。,Sampling is primarily either non-probability or probability based.
7188,非概率抽样包括就近抽样、目标式抽样、滚雪球抽样和专家抽样。概率抽样包括简单随机抽样（抽签方法、名称方法、出生日期或电脑方法）、系统抽样、分层抽样和多阶整群抽样。,"Non-probability sampling includes convenience, purposive, snowball sampling and expert sampling.Probability sampling includes simple random sampling (lottery method, first name, date of birth or computer-generated methods), stratified sampling, cluster sampling and multi-stage sampling."
7189,"在大都会区域(metropolitan areas),“大都会政府”经常会作为一个提案交给选民表决。","Every so often in a metropolitan area, Metropolitan Government is put up to the voters."
7189,但是，选民总是加以否决，根本没有商量余地。选民们当然有他们自己的理由，虽然在很多大都会区域的 问题上，存在着共同行动和协调一致的需要(包括金融方面的支持），但是更加需要的是这个区域内的各个地方政府间这种那种的协调。,"The voters inexorably and invariably turn it down.The voters are right, in spite of the fact that there is great need for common and coordinated action (and financial support) on many metropolitan area problems, and  still more need for localized coordination here and there among different governmental units within a metropolitan area."
7190,我们所采用的分析方法取决于研究问题的复杂程度。,The method of analysis adopted depends on the complexity of the research question.
7190,如果它只包含一个变量，则选择一种适用于单变量分析的方法。,"If it involves only one variable, select a method of analysis appropriate for univariate analysis."
7190,如果问题包括两个 变量，我们将使用双变量的分析方法。,If the question involves two variables we will use a method designed for bivariate analysis and so on .
7190,在每种分析水平上（单变量、双变量、多变量），都有一系列的分析方法。,"Within each level of analysis (univariate, bivariate, multivariate) there is a range of methods of analysis."
7191,不过，如果我是一个单子，并且把万物都内在化了，那我在理解宇宙时要做的所有事情就是注视内在自我。,But if I am a monad and I internalize everything there is then all I need to understand the universe is to contemplate my own inner self.
7191,确实，我的位置和视角以及反映能力的敏锐性将限制我的学习。,"To be sure, what I learn will be conditioned by my positionality and perspective as well as by the acuity of my mirroring capacity."
7191,但是，如莱布尼茨实际上做的那样，坚持下列立场仍然是合理的，即“我是万物的尺度”，并且对自己内在状况的深入反思是获得全部宇宙知识所必需的。,"But it is still reasonable to argue, as Leibniz indeed did, that ""I am the measure of all things"" and that deep reflection on my own internal conditions is all that is required to achieve full knowledge of the universe."
7192,他们的一般性理论作为环境变化后弹性与适应性循环的模式而出现。,Their general theory emerges as a model of the cycle of resilience and adaptation following change.
7192,这可以想象为麦比乌斯带(Mobius strip)随时间变化的轨迹，如图7.4所示。,"This is envisaged as a Mobius strip trajectory through time, as shown in Figure 7."
7192,如果我们从条带左下方一次扰动 (比如打击)开始，新情况的特征是有机体的重组和短期的外貌或向外扩展——先锋期。,"4. If we start following a major perturbation (say a shock) at the bottom left of the strip, the new situation is characterized by reorganization and the transient appearance or expansion of organisms – the pioneer stage."
7193,道德审查对于有关人类或非人类的研究而言都是必需的。研究者在研究主题中需陈述研究的目的、目标或提出的假设，研究的方法论和方法，控制和维护数据集的程序以及保密或匿名事件。,"Ethical clearance for research involving human and non-human participants/subjects usually involves researchers in stating the research aims and objectives or hypotheses, the methodology and methods of the research, protocols foradministering and maintaining data sets and confidentiality or anonymityissues."
7193,还需说明获得准许的方式（口头的或书面的）及与研究相关的互惠性。,"The type of consent (informed or written), and aspects of reciprocityassociated with the research, may also be required."
7193,一些道德审核小组还要求在此部分附有问卷或访谈时间计划表，口头准许原文和书面准许表。,"Some ethical panels desirethe inclusion of questionnaire or interview schedules, informed consent textsand written consent sheets."
7193,最好在提交研究计划时就开始申请道德审査，这样就可及时获得审批了。,"It is best to apply for ethical clearance when theresearch proposal is submitted, so that the processing of the clearance is timely."
7194,不是所有的城市地标都是房屋建筑形式。,Not all city landmarks are buildings.
7194,但是，房屋是城市的主要地标形式，有些房屋建筑可以成为好的地标，有些则不能。让一个房屋建筑成为好的地标的原则同样也适用于其他地标类形式的建筑，如纪念碑、水塔等。,"However, buildings are the principal landmarks in cities and the principles which make them serve well or ill apply also to most other kinds of landmarks, such as monuments, dramatic fountains, and so on."
7195,“位置”这个词也承载着过多的意义。,"But the word ""place"" also carries a surfeit of meanings."
7195,首先，存在着各种各样的词，如环境、地点、位置、场所、邻里、地区、领土等等，它们都是指地方的一般特性。,"To begin with, there are all sorts of words such as milieu, locality, location, locale, neighborhood, region, territory, and the like, which refer to the generic qualities of place."
7195,也存在另外一些术语，如城市、乡村、集镇、都市以及国家等，它们指明某类特殊的地方，再者，如家、家庭、“帮会”、社区和民族等，它们具有同样强烈的地方内涵，这使得我们在谈论一个术语时很难不涉及其他术语。,"There are other terms such as city, village, town, megalopolis, and state which designate particular kinds of places and still others, such as home, hearth, ""turf,"" community, and nation, which have such strong connotations of place that it would be hard to talk about one without the other."
7196,“位置”(像空间和时间那样)也具有一种特别广泛的比喻意义。,"""Place"" (like space and time) also has an extraordinary range of metaphorical meanings."
7196,我们谈论艺术在社会生活中的位置，人在社会中的位置，我们在宇宙中的位置，以及根据对自己位置的认知，或者感觉到我们拥有一个同他人相爱或相互尊重的位置，而把这些观念在精神上内在化。,"We talk about the place of art in social life, the place of men in society, our place in the cosmos, and we internalize such notions psychologically in terms of knowing our place or feeling we have a place in the affections or esteem of others."
7196,通过把人、事件和物置于他们的“合适”位置，我们说明规范，并试图通过努力确定一个被压迫者能够自由说话的新位置(例如“在边缘”或“在边界上”)而颠覆那些规范。,"We express norms by putting people, events, and things in their ""proper"" place and seek to subvert norms by struggling to define a new place (""on the margin"" or ""on the border,"" for example) from which the oppressed can freely speak."
7196,在我们的语言中，位置必定是层次最多和用途最广的关键词之一。,Place has to be one of the most multi-layered and multipurpose keywords in our language.
7197,在曰常经济中，加入这些贸易模式并不需要对地方社群作出承诺。,"In the ordinary economy, there is no commitment to the local community built into the patterns of trading."
7197,作为回报，它提供全球市场的自由，这也很重要。,"In return, it offers the freedom of the global market, which is also important."
7197,地方性就业和贸易体系并不否定全球经济的价值或者全球自由贸易的价值，它只是补充性的，而非替代体系。,"The LETSystem does not deny the value of the global economy or of free global trading – it is a complementary, not an alternative."
7198,土地系统法提供了一种应用于自然环境的方法，在这方面得到地理信息系统（GIS）极大的帮助，它为数据获取与分析提供了多尺度的途径。,The land-system approach provided an applied approach to physical environment greatly assisted by geographical information systems (GIS) which liberated multiscale approaches to data acquisition and analysis.
7198,在GPS设备和实时分析帮助下取得更大的进步，现在有可能在自然环境中定位，带来数据获取和分析技术的进步是一种彻底的革命。,Further progress was aided by GPS facilities and by real-time analysis so that the way in which it is now possible to perceive place in the physical environment has been completely revolutionized as a result of advances in data acquisition and analysis techniques.
7198,此类进步意味着原来各自独立的全球性和地方性方法现在可以通过遥感和GIS技术结合起来。,Such advances have meant that the initially independent global and local approaches can now be amalgamated by remote sensing and GIS.
7199,这是我最悲哀的发现:我自己身上……也产生了那种最要命的帝国主义形式。,This was my saddest discovery: when I found that in myself ... that most crucial form of imperialism had happened.
7199,也就是说，你的思想的某些部分被一种观念系统、感觉系统所支配，这些系统确实源自权力中心。,"That is to say, where parts of your mind are taken over by a system of ideas, a system of feelings, which really do emanate from the power centre."
7199,正是在你自己的意识中，正是在被压迫和被剥夺的共同体中，存在着那种统治中心的思维和感觉的再生产要素。,"Right back in your own mind, and right back inside the oppressed and deprived community there are reproduced elements of the thinking and the feeling of that dominating centre."
7200,电话调查和邮寄调查一样，研究者只需用上门调查的一部分成本就可以收集地域范围更广的数据。,"Telephone surveys, like mail surveys, enable researchers to target a wide geographical area for a fraction of the cost of household surveys."
7200,除了被要求延迟电话回复以外，电话调查没有时间延迟，因此它比邮寄调查在回复成功率方面更胜一筹。,Telephone surveys are quicker than mail surveys with respect to successful calls as there is no time lag in receiving responses unless a call-back later is requested.
7200,电话调查可以使访问人员控制交流 (除非被访者挂断电话）并且保证专注地回答问题。,Telephone surveys enable the interviewer to control the exchange (unless the respondent hangs up) and ensure that the person targeted answers the questions.
7201,在我的第一个讲座里你们已经看到运用这些技巧的一个例子，即墨菲等人是如何借助一个简单的对称、定价受到限制的垄断厂商模型，澄清了大推进理论的含糊之处。,"You've already seen an example of these tricks in the first lecture, where I showed how Murphy et al. used a simple model of symmetric, limit-pricing monopolists to cut through the confusions of the Big Push story."
7201,并不是每个人都高兴看到这类分析手法：我就听说不止一位诺贝尔经济学奖得主把墨菲等人的文章生气地扔到一旁，说“不可能那么简单。”,"Not everyone is happy with this kind of analytical sleight of hand: I have heard that at least one Nobel laureate reacted to their paper with an angry dismissal, saying ""it can't be that simple."""
7202,具体来说，旅游研究者是从一个证明因果关系的“理论”开始他们的研究的。,"Specifically, the tourism researcher commences their study from a 'theory' that demonstrates causal relationships."
7202,研究者使用定量研究方法，并随后提出一种假设。,The researcher uses a quantitative methodology and subsequently develops a hypothesis.
7202,数据将用诸如问卷的方式收集，然后用数学公式加以分析。,"Data would then be gathered using, say, questionnaires, and then analysed using mathematical formulae."
7202,样本单位的抽取将按照随机抽样的原则以使研究结论能代表被研究对象的总体特征。,Samples would be selected to be representative of the population being studied as well as randomly selected.
7203,采用定性研究方法的研究植根于解释社会学。它们在本质上是归纳性的，是对所研究现象进行的文本描述。,"Research that is informed by a qualitative methodology is grounded in the interpretive social sciences, is inductive in nature and is based on textual representations of the phenomenon under study."
7203,定性研究方法与批判理论、女性主义及后现代主义的研究方法有关。,"It also has some synergies with critical theory, feminist research and postmodern approaches."
7204,在这些方面，权力常被概念化为“纪律性权力”，是一种到处扩散的、不确定位置的力量，它渗透到各个层次的社会阶层，并且在多重的、调解斡旋的网络冲以间接的而且往往让人捉摸不定的方式被重新创造出来。,"Power is conceptualized as a diffuse and unlocatable force, that permeates all levels of society and that is reproduced in indirect and often erratic ways through multiple mediatory networks."
7204,这样，所有个体都处于既运用权力又受制于权力的地位。,"In this way, all individuals are both in a position of simultaneously exercising power but also being subject to it."
7204,然而，需要牢记的是在同一个时代条件之下，最强大的权力来源是资本主义生产方式、父权制（家长统治）和种族主义。,
7204,对抗强调的是，个人或小团体在这些或其他来源的权力和压制之下，对其处境进行改造的方式。,Resistance places the emphasis on the way individuals and groups find ways of reworking their situation in the face of power and oppression.
7205,多变量分析是指同时对两个以上变量的分析。,Multivariate analysis involves the analysis of more than two variables at the one time.
7205,研究者保持一个变量为常量 （作为控制变量），然后，检验一个自变量和一个因变量的关系。,The researcher holds one variable constant (as a control) and examines an independent and a dependent variable.
7205,研究者可通过检验来判断自变量和因变量的关系对于另一变量的不同种类是否一致。,The researcher tests to see if the association between the independent and dependent variable is the same for different categories in a variable.
7206,只要存在具有不同气质、信念和意识形态各种人。只要他们有某些思想要表达，那么就应该有实证主义地理学、马克思地理学、维也纳学派地理学、法兰克福学派地理学、里昂学派地理学等等的存在空间。,"As long as there are people around with different temperaments, beliefs and ideologies, and as long as they have something to say, there should be room for positivist geography for Marxist geography, for Vienna-circle geography, for Frankfurt-school geography, for Lyon-group geography, and so on."
7206,学派越多，越令人高兴 (P.105)。,"The more, the merrier (p, 105)."
7207,反机构化最极端的结果发生在加利福尼亚州。,The most extreme consequences of deinstitutionalization are to be found in California.
7207,该州精神病院的迅速关闭导致服务依赖型集聚区（service-dependent ghettos)的出现（也被称为无墙庇护所 (asylum-without-walls)。,"The rapid closure of psychiatric hospitals in the state led to the creation of service-dependent ghettoes (also termed the‘asylum-without-walls’, Wolch, 1981)."
7207,从前的隐性精神病人被限制在环境恶劣的邻里中，而规划立法则将基于社区的设施规划在更加富裕的地区。,Former in-patients have become restricted to poorer-quality neighbourhoods as zoning legislation has kept community-based facilitiesoutside more affluent areas.
7208,互惠性指给参与者一些回报。反身性指把自己置于研究中。,"Reciprocity means giving something back to the participants, and reflexivity means locating oneself in one's research."
7208,马库斯（Marcus 1994)定义了四种反身性：主观反身性、客观化的反身性；、政治定位的反身性以及主观的、经验的反身性。,"Marcus (1994) identifies four types of reflexivity: subjectivist; objectified; located politically; and subjectivist, experiential."
7209,资料三角校正是指研究者在研究过程引入多种资料来源。,Researchers concerned with data triangulation draw on various sources of data in the research process.
7209,调查者三角校正是指研究中雇用若干个研究者或评论者。,Investigator triangulation refers to the employment of several researchers or evaluators in a study.
7209,理论三角校正是指研究者用几种方法或视角分析资料。,Theory triangulation involves researchers using several theories or perspectives to analyse data.
7209,方法论的三角校正是指研究者使用多种方法收集与研究相关的资料。,Methodological triangulation involves researchers using several methods to gather data relevant to a study.
7210,定性研究方法植根于解释社会学范式，且与最近兴起的女性主义的研究方法相一致。,The qualitative approach is grounded in the interpretive social sciences paradigm and sits comfortably with the more recently espoused feminist approaches to the conduct of research.
7210,定性研究方法收集信息以形成许多个文本单元，这些文本单元再现了正在研究的旅游现象的社会现实、背景和特征。,"The qualitative methodology gathers information as text-based units, which represent the social reality, context and attributes of the tourism phenomenon under study."
7210,这种研究从方法论的角度看，其本质是归纳性的。,The methodology is inductive in nature.
7211,参考文献是指在引言、文献综述和方法论部分所提到和引用过的文献，而不包括那些只是阅读过而没有加以引用的文章。,"References are those documents that you have accessed and noted in your introduction, literature review and methodology sections.The references should not include works you have read but did not cite."
7211,参考文献应该按字母的序列出并根据学校或委托人所要求的格式编写。,References should be listed in alphabetical order and presented in the style that your university or the client requires.
7211,本书参考文献是依据澳大利亚政府出版社的《文体手册》（Style Manual）第五版中的“作者时代系统”的要求编写的。,"This textbook follows the author-date system used in the Australian Government Publishing Service, Style Manual, Fifth Edition."
7212,一些方法既可以应用于定性研究也可以应用于定量研究，例如访谈法和观察法。,"Some methods are used for both qualitative and quantitativeresearch, such as interviews and observation."
7212,然而，每种研究方法的步骤则取决于其所使用的方法论。,"However, the procedures for each differ depending on the methodology being used."
7212,使用不同的方法论还会影响研究结果的表述（参见第十章和第十一章）。,The methodologies used will also influence the reporting of the research findings (see chapters10 and 11).
7213,半结构化访谈属于谈话范畴，但采访者事先已就关注互动的主题拟定了问题提纲。,"Semi-structured interviews remain within the genre of a conversation; however, the interviewer has a prompt list of issues that focus the interaction."
7213,这个提纲使得访谈具备了一定结构性，尽管提纲上所讨论的事件的次序可能在访谈中有变动。,"The list adds some structure to the interview, although the ordering of the discussion about the issues on the list may vary between interviews."
7213,同非结构化访谈一样， 半结构化访谈本质上具有一定灵活性而且遵循受访者的思维过程。,"As with unstructured interviews, semi-structured interviews are fluid in nature and follow the thinking processes of the interviewee."
7214,为了强调和突出新秩序的必要性，非中心主义者(decentralists)们把目标锁定破旧的老城，并向其发起了频频攻击。,"To reinforce and dramatize the necessity for the new order of things, the Decentralists hammered away at the bad old city."
7214,他们对大城市成功之处漠不关心。,They were incurious about successes in great cities.
7214,他们只对失败有兴趣。,They were interested only in failures.
7214,所有的一切都是失败。,All was failure.
7215,这暗示着，任何有机体的进化，包括社会自身的进化(怀特海并不反对把社会看作某种有机体，尽管他绝不会屈尊去详细说明意义)，在某种程度上都是以时间和空间的特殊分离为基础的，就如与资本主义现代性密切联系在一起的社会理论广泛主张的那样。,"The implication is that the evolution of any organism, including that of society itself (and Whitehead was not averse to considering society as an organism of some sort though he never deigns to specify the meaning), is to some degree predicated on a particular separation of time and space, such as that so prevalent in the social theory that attaches to capitalist modernity."
7215,至少在今天，我们可以把分离看成是过程的产物。,But we can at least now think of the separation as the product of a process.
7215,结果便为批判性地研究那些特殊的过程带来一线光明，这些过程暗示在社会理论本身中存在着这样的分离。,The effect is to open up an aperture for critical discussion of those particular processes that imply such a separation within social theory itself.
7216,旧金山市最近采用分区规划对其城区建筑物高度作了限定。,The city of San Francisco recently adopted a zoning plan that restricts building heights in its downtown area.
7216,这项政策的目的在于限制城区的工人数量。,The objective of the policy is to limit the number of people working downtown.
7216,通过限制工人数量，城市官员希望能够控制通向城市的桥梁上的交通量，因为这些桥梁上的交通已经十分拥挤了。,"By limiting the number of downtown workers, city officials hope to control the volume of traffic on the bridges into the city, all of which are already congested."
7217,除了为附录添加标题外，还应提供页码索引，这样才便于读者查找。,Appendices should be titled and a page reference should be provided sothat the reader can easily locate them.
7217,图10-7展示了表格、图表、地图和附录的目录列举方式。,"Tables, figures, maps and appendicesshould be listed as in figure 10."
7217,对于表格、图表和地图来说，第一个数字是指项目所在的章数，而位于句点后面的第二个数字是指在每章中出现的顺序如第一、第二、第三等。,"7. Note that for tables, figures and maps thefirst numeral relates to the chapter number in which the item is located andthe second numeral after the full stop relates to the order in which the material is presented in each chapter — first, second, third, and so on."
7218,描述性调査法用以描述人口特征，这已在全国性人口普査中被采用。,
7218,,Descriptive surveys describe the population and are exemplified by national censuses.
7218,然而，在旅游与接待业的相关研究中，运用描述性调查法一般不会涉及如此大规模的数据，而只是依靠使用概率抽样调査以反映总体的特征。,"However, within tourism and hospitality contexts, descriptive surveys are generally not carried out on such a large scale and rely on the use of probability sampling techniques to reflect the overall population."
7218,描述性调査法使研究者得以了解“研究对象是谁（who）”（旅游者和观光客的人口统计特征），“研究的是什么（what) ”（活动和目的地的偏好）以及“研究对象怎么样（how) ”（社会和经济状况）。,"Descriptive surveys enable researchers to describe the 'who' (demographic characteristics of tourists and visitors), 'what' (activities and destination preferences) and 'how' (social and economic status) of the study population."
7219,所有解释和理论化的形式都依赖于现象和事件的个性化以及在现象和事件之间建立某种跨越时间和空间的联系。,All forms of explanation and theorizing are dependent upon(a) the individuation of phenomena and events and(b) on the establishment of some mode of connection across space and time between phenomena and events.
7219,然而，很少有人重视这些关系应该如何构造。,Yet very little critical attention has been paid to how such relations should be constructed.
7219,由于缺乏重视，它们便成为一种惯例。,"By default, they become a matter of convention."
7220,例如，穷困的女性化(北卡罗来纳的哈姆雷特就是典型)已经成为美国过去20年来最令人吃惊的社会转向之一，是共和党对福利国家和工人阶级权益进行阶级战争的直接受害者。,"The feminization of poverty (not foreign to Hamlet, North Carolina) has been, for example, one of the most startling social shifts in the United States over the past two decades, a direct casualty of the Republican Party class-war against the welfare state and working-class rights and interests."
7220,西格尔继续说：“社会民主党执政时期越长和工会力量越强的国家中，男女工资差别和职业隔离(既是纵向的又是横向的)就越小，福利服务的扩展就越大。”,"""In countries where there have been longer periods of social-democratic government and stronger trade unions,"" Segal continues, ""there is far less pay-differential and occupational segregation (both vertical and horizontal) between women and men, and far greater expansion of welfare services."""
7221,在什么样的情况下工资歧视将持续下去？,Under what conditions would wage discrimination persist?
7221,如果某个人厂商能够阻止其他厂商进人该行业，那么它就能避免与没有神族歧视（color blind)的厂商进行竞争以保护自己。,"If a white firm can keep other firms from entering its industry, it can protect itself from the competition of color-blind firms."
7221,但是，顽固并不是没有代价的。,"However, bigotry is not costless."
7221,白人垄断者为白神工人支付较高的工资，这样较髙的生产成本迫使其消费者支付较高的价格。,"The white monopolist pays relatively high wages to its white workers, and its higher production costs force its consumers to pay a relatively high price."
7222,正如这个例子向我们启示的那样，我们不能从外部印象或其他一些预想中的重要迹象来推断一种用途多有效，多么吸引人。,"As this suggests, you cannot tell from outward impressiveness or other signs of putative importance how effective a primary use is, as an atttactor of people."
7222,有些外表很壮观的建筑实际上却是效用不大。,Some of the most impressive looking are ineffectual in performance.
7222,比如，费城的公共图书馆的主楼，它夹在一个有历史意义的文化中心的中间，吸引的使用者比它的三个分馆(包括一个位于城市中心区切斯特纳特街商店中间的很漂亮但并不张扬的分馆)还要少。,"For instance, the main building ofPhiladelphia's public library.stuck in a monumental cultural center, draws fewer users than three of the library's branches, including an attractive but unostentatious establishment inserted among the downtown shops of Chestnut Street."
7223,市民身份（citizenship)的概念“是指个人与社会（或国家）之间的关系，这种关系决定着他们是谁、在哪里生活，并由此影响着他们的生活。”。,The idea of citizenship 'refers to relationships between individuals and the community (or State) which impinges on their lives because of who they are and where they live'.
7223,与臣服于君主的效忠观念（见第二章）紧密相连的前现代权利等级和特权观念不同的是，市民身份意味着相互责任义务相伴的合理性。,"In contrast to the premodern hierarchies of rights and privileges tied to the notion of the allegiance of subjects to a monarch (see Chapter 2), citizenship implies a rationality that is accompanied by mutual obligations."
7223,随着现代社会的到来而出现的市民身份（见第三章）是与新建或重建后国家的领土边界联系在一起的，而不再是与贵族的神权统治联系在一起。,The citizenship that emerged with the onset of modernity (see Chapter 3) was tied to the territorial boundaries of new and reconstituted national states rather than to the divine authority of nobility.
7224,时空相关性理论表明：不同过程如何能够定义完全不同的时空性，并因此建立实体、位置和关系之完全不同的同一。,"The relational theory of spatio-temporality indicates how different processes can define completely different spatio-temporalities, and so set up radically different identifications of entities, places and relations."
7224,对莱布尼茨来说，这只是对可能世界的一种理论探究，并因此只受想象力限制。,For Leibniz this was simply a theoretical exploration of possible worlds and therefore solely confined to the imaginary.
7224,但对于怀特海(以及巴赫金和列斐伏尔)来说，依据被研究的过程之本质，这些完全不同的时空性及其相关制图法都被认为是真实的。,"But for Whitehead (and Bakhtin as well as Lefebvre), these radically different spatio-temporalities and their associated cartographies are construed as real, dependent upon the nature of the process being examined."
7225,迈克(Mckay)牌缝纫机实现了将鞋底缝到鞋帮上这一工序的机械化操作。提高了鞋业生产的规模经济，使得中心车间成为真正意义上的工厂。,"The McKay sewing machine, which mechanized the process of sewing the soles to the uppers, increased scale economies in shoe production to the point that the central shop became a genuine factory."
7225,城市在新的鞋厂附近发展起来。,Cities developed around the new shoe factories.
7226,在所需的地块得到保证之后，发展商们就可以通过其开发的住房的自然与社会特性而对城市结构造成一定的影响。,"Having secured the sites they need, developers are able to exert a considerable influence on urban structure through the physical and social character of the housing they build (Rabinowitz, 1996)."
7226,他们建造的住房在他们自己看来是市场需要的、而且是最易开发及最保险的项目（在市场条件下）。,"They build what they think the market wants, and what is easiest and safest (in marketing terms) to produce."
7226,考虑到他们对充足的廉价土地的需求和对建造速度的要求，兼顾规模经济与标准化生产所能产生的效益，最终的结果是发展商十分倾向于在城市边缘区建造大型的、一致的住房类型。,"Given their need for plentiful supplies of cheap land and for speed of construction, together with the advantages to be derived from economies of scale and standardization, the result is a strong tendency to build large, uniform housing subdivisions on peripheral sites (Whitehand and Carr, 2001; Hayden, 2003)."
7227,资本主义必然以增长为导向，在技术上是动态的，并且容易出现危机。,"Capitalism is necessarily growth oriented, technologically dynamic, and crisis prone."
7227,地理扩张是它暂时地和部分地克服资本过度积累危机(闲置的生产力加上失业的劳动力)的方式之一。,One of the ways it can temporarily and in part surmount crises of overaccumulation of capital (idle productive capacity plus unemployed labor power) is through geographical expansion.
7227,我称之为资本主义矛盾的“空间定位”。,"This is what I call the ""spatial fix"" to capitalism's contradictions."
7228,这种扇形迁移因“社区领袖”倾向于偏好非工业滨水地带与高地而得到强化；而其他的高收人群体则追求与这些要人居住在同一邻里的社会标记。,This sectoral movement is reinforced by a tendency among ‘community leaders’ to favour non-industrial waterside sites and higher ground; and for the rest of the higher-income groups to seek the social cachet of living in the same neighbourhood as these prominenti.
7228,当他们对现有住房不满并导致旨在维持其排他性的新房外迁时，就会出现进一步的扇形发展。,
7228,,"Over time, further sectoral development occurs as the most prominent households move outwards to new housing in order to maintain standards of exclusivity."
7228,紧接着高社会地位家庭的外迁，其空置下来的住房则被中等地位家庭所占有，而中等地位家庭拥有的住房则接着被低社会地位家庭所占有（称之为过滤的过程）。,"In the wake of this continual outward movement of high-status households, the housing they vacate is occupied by middle-status households whose own housing is in turn occupied by lower-status households (a process termed filtering)."
7229,强烈反资本主义的理由之一便是它制造了一种相对同质化资本主义个人。,One of the strong objections to capitalism is that it has produced a relatively homogeneous capitalist person.
7229,把所有人和全部文化差异都还原为共同的商品化基础，这种还原论是强烈反资本主义情绪的焦点。,This reductionism of all beings and all cultural differences to a common commodified base is the focus of strong anti-capitalistic sentiments.
7229,社会主义事业必须包容并寻求从那种冷漠的商品化同质性中解放出来。,The socialist cause must encompass and seek emancipation from that bland commodified homogeneity.
7230,这使得进一步深究下述问题成为可能，为什么地方在当代世界中正变得越来越重要而非相反。,This permits a second cut at why place is becoming more rather than less important in the contemporary world.
7230,海德格尔的主张，以及其后许多作家从他那里吸收的，是有可能抵抗或拒绝地方建设之任何简单的资本主义(或现代主义)逻辑。,"What Heidegger holds out, and what many subsequent writers have drawn from him, is the possibility of some kind of resistance to or rejection of any simple capitalist (or modernist) logic of place construction."
7230,由此可以推断，技术合理性、商品化、市场价值和资本积累不断增强的对社会生活(或者如包括哈贝马斯在内的许多作家所称“生活世界”)的渗透，加之时空压缩，将激发一些抵抗，这些抵抗越来越强地聚集于地方(在这个词的最广泛意义上来理解)的替代性建造上。,"It would then follow that the increasing penetration of technological rationality, of commodification and market values, and capital accumulation into social life (or into what many writers, including Habermas, call ""the life world"") together with time-space compression, will provoke resistances that increasingly focus on alternative constructions of place (understood in the broadest sense of that word)."
7231,有些交界处不可救药，不用奢想把其变成接缝处。,It is hopeless to try to convert some borders into seams.
7231,高速公路以及旁边的斜坡就是这样的例子。,Expressways and their ramps are examples.
7231,其实，即使在一些大型公园、校园或河边（warerfronts）地带这样的地方，屏障问题也只能在沿着其边界地带的地域才能得到有效控制。,"Moreover, even in the case of large parks, campuses or warerfronts, the barrier effects can likely be overcome well only along portions of perimeters."
7232,许多根本不同的线索通过一般结论汇聚起来。,There are a number of disparate threads to be drawn together in the guise of a general conclusion.
7232,一方面，我们发现有一条社会正义的论证路线，它经过后现代主义和后结构主义达到这种认识：某些(非特定的)普遍是必须的，某类认识论(非特定的)对于确定差异和异质性在何时、何地及如何具有重大意义是需要的。,"On the one hand we find a line of argument about social justice that passes through postmodernism and poststructuralism to arrive at a point of recognition that some kind of (unspecified) universals are necessary and that some sort of epistemology (unspecified) is needed to establish when, how and where difference and heterogeneity are significant."
7232,另一方面，我们处在一种政治—经济的情境之中，如北卡罗来纳惨案所刻画的一样，这种情境表明进步政治在面对阶级压迫时看似瘫痪的状态。,"On the other hand, we have a political-economic situation, as characterized by the North Carolina deaths, which indicates a seeming paralysis of progressive politics in the face of dass oppression."
7233,"当然，这需要长期的艰苦努力，需要许多方法论方面的经验(Rose, 2001)。","This is a much harder slog, of course, one which requires a lot of methodological expertise (Rose, 2001)."
7233,同时想要借助一幅固定的大图画比如后现代主义把它描绘出来要更困难得多。,
7233,,"It also makes it much more difficult to write in terms of one stable big picture like postmodernism, rather than multiple, shifting arrangements."
7233,但这也许不是一件那样坏的事情。,But then perhaps that is not such a bad thing.
7234,在讨论旅游研究者对发起人所承担的伦理责任部分，我们谈到了激励和报酬。,"In the section dealing with the tourism researcher's responsibilities to the sponsor, we touched on the issue of incentives and payment."
7234,凡特曼（Fetterman 1998）说道，或许这种互惠性是研究者最不喜欢的，因为对于人们为何参与研究，研究者总是存在疑问。,Fetterman (1989) suggests that this type of reciprocity is perhaps the least preferred by researchers as there is always a question mark concerning the person's participation.
7234,他们的参与纯粹是为了研究还是为了报酬？,Did they participate for the sake of the study or for the sake of the payment?
7235,文化的核心是一些认识，通常被称作话语（discourses)或叙述。,Central to culture are shared sets of understandings ---what are often called discoursesor narratives.
7235,对于为这些涵义提供线索的符号的研究被称为符号学（semiology)(或者记号语言学）。,The study of the signs that give clues about these meanings is known as semiology(or semiotics).
7235,指向这些广泛涵义的实物被命名为能指（signifiers)，而文化涵义被称为所指（signified)。,The things that point to these wider meanings are termed signifiers while the cultural meaning is called the signified.
7236,如果科学上先进的欧洲能够克服殖民地挑战性环境的不利方面，疏干瘟疫丛生的沼泽，灌溉不毛的沙漠，则不仅能改善殖民地经济的生产力，而且随着时间的推移，将改善当地社会与文化的性质。,"If scientifically advanced European societies could overcome the worst aspects of the challenging environments of the colonial periphery by draining the pestilential marsh or irrigating the barren desert, this would not only improve colonial economic productivity but would also, in time, improve the nature of the local societies and cultures."
7236,这样，环境与道德的“改善”就会紧密地相互联系，而且二者均有赖于一种“优秀的”外来力量的“仁慈的”干预。,Environmental and moral ‘improvement’ were thus intimately interlinked and both were dependent on the ‘benign’ intervention of a ‘superior’ external force.
7236,最后，如能配合明智的文化与教育政策，殖民地人民就会控制好他们自己的资源，管理好他们自己的事务。,
7237,地理这个词具有两个主要解释：一个指通用的概念，也就是环境；而另一个是学术性的含义，指的是对环境的研究。,"The word geography has two major definitions: one is vernacular, and refers to the environment; the other is academic, and refers to the study of tlie environment."
7237,因而自然地理既意味着自然环境，也意味着对自然环境的研究。,Thus physical geography means either the physical environment or the study of the physical environment.
7237,人文地理学在这里被当作一门社会科学，它研究与空间和地方有关的那些社会的特殊方面(包括自然环境）。,
7238,环境经济学也是一种把环境问题提上议事日程的有益和实用的工具。,Environmental economics is also a useful and pragmatic tool for getting environmental issues on the agenda.
7238,在此，我引用奥顿在佐治亚州争取湿地保护合法化斗争为例，他强调湿地对于国家经济具有某种看似有理然而相当武断的货币价值。,"I cite here E.P. Odum's struggle to gain wetland protection legislation in his home state of Georgia, which fell upon deaf ears until he put some plausible but rather arbitrary money values on the worth of wetlands to the state economy (see Gosselink et al., 1974)."
7238,这成功地说服了立法机关相对较早地阐明了广泛的湿地保护的合法性。,"This persuaded the legislature to formulate, at a relatively early date, extensive wetland protection legislation."
7239,会议论文有两种：工作论文和研究论文。,There are two types of conference papers: working papers and researchpapers.
7239,工作论文是对研究进展的汇报，而研究论文通常是对已完成的研究的汇报。,"Working papers report on research-in-progress, while researchpapers usually report on research that has been completed."
7239,由于工作论文讨论正在进行的研究，所以听众会被研究过程所吸引并且对此提出批判性评论和建议。,"Since working papers discuss research that is underway, the audience is expected to engage with the research and provide critical comments and suggestions."
7239,虽然研究论文是关于已完成的研究的报告，听众也会对研究过程感兴趣，并且对研究的目的、应用的方法和结果进行评论。,"Although research papers report on research that has been completed, again the audience is expected to engage in the work, providing critical commentary on the research aims, the methods used and the findings."
7240,准备使用混沌理论范式的研究者需要理解该范式及与其相关的研究含义。,Researchers intent on using the chaos theory paradigm need to understand the paradigm and its associated implications for research.
7240,研究者和学生在以往的研究中借用某些词汇的隐喻义，创造了有关混沌理论的专用词汇，其中包括术语“混沌”。,"In the past, researchers and students have appropriated the vocabulary for use in a metaphorical sense, including the term 'chaos'."
7240,其实，理解混沌理论(混沌现象）中使用的术语或词汇的隐喻意义与专业定义之间的差别是很重要的。,"It is important to understand the difference between the metaphorical and technical meanings associated with the terms and vocabulary used in chaos theory (Symptoms of Chaos, n.d.)."
7241,第一章中已经介绍了研究方法在本质上的两重性分类：定量研究方法与定性研究方法。,In chapter 1 you were introduced to an essentially binary classification of research methodologies: qualitative and quantitative methodologies.
7241,其中也提到了第三种方法：混合研究方法。,A third type was also suggested: the mixed method approach.
7241,到目前为止，你应该明白定量与定性方法是定位在关于世界观（即本体论观点）连续统一体的对立两极。,"By now, you should be aware that qualitative and quantitative methodologies are located at opposite ends of a continuum regarding world views, that is ontological positions."
7242,环境经济学也是一种把环境问题提上议事日程的有益和实用的工具。,Environmental economics is also a useful and pragmatic tool for getting environmental issues on the agenda.
7242,在此，我引用奥顿在佐治亚州争取湿地保护合法化斗争为例，他强调湿地对于国家经济具有某种看似有理然而相当武断的货币价值。,"I cite here E.P. Odum's struggle to gain wetland protection legislation in his home state of Georgia, which fell upon deaf ears until he put some plausible but rather arbitrary money values on the worth of wetlands to the state economy (see Gosselink et al., 1974)."
7242,这促使立法机构在相对较早的时候制定了广泛的湿地保护法。这之前，他的行动一直得不到人们的关注(参阅Gosselink et al.，1974)。,"This persuaded the legislature to formulate, at a relatively early date, extensive wetland protection legislation."
7243,尽管特权群体的态度和结构性作用对解释居住隔离大有帮助，但是它们仍然不能有效地解释为什么少数群体会集聚到分散的均质地域中去。,"While charter group attitudes and structural effects go a long way towards explaining residential segregation, they do not satisfactorily explain the clustering (congregation) of minority groups into discrete, homo-geneous territories."
7243,我们必须从功能上的防御性和保守性来看待少数群体的这种集群，部分是为了应对上述外部压力。,"Such clusters must also be seen as defensive and conservative in function, partly in response to the external pressures outlined above."
7243,简而言之，当人们——尤其是移民和外来移民——感到受到威胁时，他们往往强烈要求内部团结，以便保持群体的社会和文化一致性。,"In short, when people – especially immigrants and in-migrants – feel threatened they often have a strong urge to internal cohesion, so that the social and cultural coherence of the group may be retained."
7244,在这一点上，很有必要讨论集中的原始数据所产生的各种分布的类型。,"At this point, it is necessary to discuss the types of distributions in which raw data aggregations may result."
7244,这是很重要的，因为分布的类型可以用正态或者偏态来描述，这将影响集中趋势量数的使用。,This is important because the type of distribution may be described as either normal or skewed and this will impact on the use of measures of central tendency.
7244,分布类型也将影响与正态或者偏态分布有关的决策制定。,The type of distribution will also affect decision making regarding how normal or skewed the distribution is.
7245,集中趋势量数彼此结合使用，在表示正、负或J-形曲线的分布中就会有疑问。,"The use of measures of central tendency in conjunction with each other become problematic in distributions representing negatively, positively or J-shaped curves."
7245,在正、负偏态曲线中，中位数是集中趋势量数中比较好测量的，因为它更接近于大多数的数值，平均值并不代表典型的个案（Tilley 1999，p.125）。,"In the case of negatively and positively skewed curves, the median is a better measure of central tendency because it is closer to the majority of the scores and the mean does not represent the 'typical' case (Tilley 1999, p. 125)."
7245,在J-形分布中，众数是比较适合的，因为它比中位数或者平均值更接近于大多数的数值（Tilley 1999，p.125）。,"In the case of J-shaped curves, the mode is more appropriate as it is closer to the majority of scores than either the median or the mean (Tilley 1999, p. 125)."
7246,在另一个极端上，除了直接感性的和沉思的经验世界，海德格尔完全拒绝任何意义的道德责任。,"Heidegger, at the other extreme, totally rejects any sense of moral responsibility beyond the world of immediate sensuous and contemplative experience."
7246,他拒绝通过国际劳动分工来研究商品的、货币的、技术的和生产的世界。,"He rejects any dealings with the world of commodity, money, technology, and production via any international division of labor."
7246,他把自己的视野限定在非常狭小的经验世界，以此来追问物之经验的先天和内在的性质。,He contracts his field of vision to a much narrower experiential world to ask questions about the innate and immanent qualities of experience of things.
7247,这种类型的整理是与不遵循“如果——那么”框架/情节的答案的记录相关的(Babbie 1995)。,This type of cleaning relates to the recording of responses that do not follow 'if-then' scenarios (Babbie 1995).
7247,巴比提供了一个例子:一个受访者被问及他们生了多少个孩子，如果一些男性登录了许多孩子，这就暗示着输入的错误。,"Babbie provides the example that an interviewee may be asked how many children they have given birth to.If any men have recorded a number of children, this indicates an error in entry."
7247,“如果——那么”框架的想法就是“如果你是一个女人，那么你才有潜能生孩子”。,"The 'if-then' scenario is ' if you are a woman, then you have the potential to give birth to a child'."
7247,如果研究与出游机会相关的家庭生命周期和生活经历，这个问题也会在旅游研究中涉及。,This question could be included in a tourism study if family life cycle and life events are being studied in relation to opportunity to engage in travel.
7248,研究项目要围绕具体的研究问题、假设或者研究目标收集相关资料。,"Research projects are designed to collect data relevant to a specific research problem, issue, hypothesis/hypotheses or aim(s)."
7248,完成定量数据的收集后，通常将积累数种数据资料（如已完成的问卷或者访谈记录）（Killion 1998)。,"As a result of quantitative data collection, you will have amassed several piles of individual data sets (completed questionnaires or interview response sheets) (Killion 1998)."
7248,单独来看，原始数据对旅游决策的制定而言意义甚小，需要深入观察，为该研究项目的研究目的或假设提供支持。,"Individually, the raw data sets mean little for tourism decision making and need further attention in order to provide meaning to the aims or hypotheses of your research project."
7249,研究是一个双重行为。,Conducting research is a twofold activity.
7249,首先，进行研究是为了收集资料或信息。,"First, you undertake the research process in order to gather data or information."
7249,其次，通过写作，可使研究从与信息需要有关的研究目标或假说，转向信息收集方法的而促进研究成果报告的完成。,"Second, you use the writing process to move you from the construction of research aims or hypothesesrelated to your information needs to the development of your data collection tool(s) and then to the reporting of your findings."
7250,在随机抽样中，研究者可以使用多种表格来帮助决定样本容量。,There are various tables available to researchers to assist in decision making regarding sample size in probability samples.
7250,本章后边罗列了一些这样的表格。随机抽样方法较多，包括：简单随机抽样（simple random sampling）、系统抽样（systematic sampling）、分层随机抽样（stratified random sampling）和多阶整群抽样（multistage cluster sampling）。,"Examples of such tables are presented later in the chapter.There are a number of random sampling approaches: simple random sampling, systematic sampling, stratified random sampling and multistage cluster sampling."
7251,定量研究报告与定性研究报告的不同之处在于所使用的主要写作方式和类型上。,The difference between qualitative and quantitative research reports is the style of writing and key genres used.
7251,定性研究报告采用叙述的文体形式，而定量研究报告使用科学报告的写作方式。,"Qualitative reports adopt a narrative style, whereas quantitative reports use the style of scientific writing."
7251,尽管并不总是按照相同的次序，但两者都包含了下列构成要素：引言、文献综述、研究结果、讨论、结论和/或建议。,"Both include the following structural elements, though not always in the same order: introduction, literature review, findings, discussion, conclusion and/or recommendations."
7252,以下给出了交叉表的例子。,A n example of cross-tabulation follows.
7252,假设：调查者假定等待时间的增加将会增加取消航班的数量。,Assume that the researcher hypotheses that increases in waiting time will increase the number of cancellations for an air transport operator.
7252,自变量或者原因变量是等待时间，因变量或者受影响的变量是取消航班的数量。,"The independent variable, or cause variable, is the waiting time and the dependent variable, or affected variable, is the number of cancellations."
7252,在一天的一段时期内，研究者收集数据然后将他们整理成表9-3所示的二元表格。,"Over the period of a day, the researcher collects data and then aggregates them into a bivariate table asshown in table 9.3."
7253,城市的人行道，孤立来看，并不重要，其意义很抽象。,A city sidewalk by itself is nothing.It is an abstraction.
7253,只有在与建筑物以及它旁边的其他东西，或者附近的其他人行道联 系起来时，它的意义才能表现出来。,"It means something only in conjunction with the buildings and other uses that border it, or border other sidewalks very near it."
7253,同样的道理也可以放在街 道上，即除了承载马路中间的交通外，它还有其他的目的。,"The same might be said of streets, in the sense that they serve other purposes besides carrying wheeled traffic in their middles."
7254,为了确保焦点群体法的可行性，群体规模需要有所限制。,"To ensure that focus groups are workable, their size needs to be limited."
7254,通常，调查人数以8~12人为宜。,Focus groups usually involve eight to 12 people.
7254,人数过多会使得成员间的互动受到限制。,Larger numbers than this result in the interactions of members being constrained and/or limited.
7254,在较大的群体中，互动会变得比较正式，人们无法畅所欲言，在这种情况下，就需要研究人员努力使所有的参与者都参与讨论。,"In larger groups, the interaction becomes more formalised and less free flowing and the facilitator has to work hard to ensure that all the participants contribute."
7255,这就带来了严重的问题。,This brings grave trouble.
7255,我们早已经看到，孤立的、互不关联的街道街区(street neighborhoods)从社会的角度讲，会陷入孤独无助的处境。,"We have already seen that isolated, discrete street neighborhoods are apt to be helpless socially."
7255,这个人有一百个理由相信八十七和八十九街或那里面的人与他没有任何关系。,This man would have every justification for disbelieving that Eighty-seventh and Eighty-ninth streets or their people have anything to do with him.
7255,如果他不这么认为，那他的日常生活就得大大变样。,"To believe it, he has to go beyond the ordinary evidence of his everyday life."
7256,定量研究报告与定性研究报告的不同之处在于所使用的主要写作方式和类型上。,The difference between qualitative and quantitative research reports is thestyle of writing and key genres used.
7256,定性研究报告采用叙述的文体形式，而定量研究报告使用科学报告的写作方式。,"Qualitative reports adopt a narrativestyle, whereas quantitative reports use the style of scientific writing."
7256,尽管并不总是按照相同的次序，但两者都包含了下列构成要素：引言、文献综述、研究结果、讨论、结论和/或建议。,"Bothinclude the following structural elements, though not always in the sameorder: introduction, literature review, findings, discussion, conclusion and/or recommendations."
7257,"沃勒斯坦（Wallerstein, 1988, 1991）提出的世界系统分析为人文地理学中对时间与空间关系提供了另一种唯物主义解释。","World-systems analysis as developed by Wallerstein (1988, 1991) offers an alternative materialist interpretation of the relations between time and space in human geography."
7257,为了强调这两个概念的永久性，他杜撰了“时空”（TimeSpace）一词来形容其特殊的综合。,To emphasize the indissolubility of the two concepts he coins the word TimeSpace to describe his particular integration.
7257,"从布劳德尔（Blaudel, 1980）界定3类社会时间——短期、中期和长期——开始，沃勒斯坦通过把空间尺度添加到每个时间跨度上，又增加了一个地理成分。","Starting with Braudel’s (1980) identification of three categories of social time – the short term, the medium term, and the long term – Wallerstein adds a geographical component by attaching a spatial scale to each temporal span."
7258,描述性研究使研究者得以描述所研究的旅游现象，而并不试图解释现象的原因。,Descriptive research enables the researcher to describe the tourism phenomenon under study.It does not attempt to explain the reasons for the phenomenon.
7258,"从根本上讲，描述性研究主要是研究“是谁”和“是什么”的问题。尽管纽曼(2000, 21~22)声称探索性研究包括“是什么”，描述性研究包括“是谁”和“怎样”，但是笔者认为，“怎样”是解释性的研究，因此它与某现象“为何”发生相关——这是解释性研究的实质。","Basically, descriptive research is interested in 'who' and 'what', although Neuman (2000, pp. 21-2) states that exploratory research covers 'what' and descriptive research covers 'who' and 'how'.However, it is this author's opinion that the 'how' moves the researcher into explanation and therefore is linked to the 'why' of a phenomenon — the essence of explanatory research."
7259,但是，社会的产生不仅要通过带来认同感的过程，而且要强调与其他团体的差异。,"Societies, however, are not only produced through processes which foster a sense of sameness, but also those which emphasize a differentiation from others."
7259,每个社会都要界定它与其他社会组织的区别。,Each society must have something to define itself against.
7259,建立起一个特定社会的概念也要依靠划分界限—不管这个界限有多少漏洞—以区别那些属于这个组织的相同的人和不属于这个组织的不同的人 。,"The construction of any particular notion of society also rests on making boundaries – however porous – between those who belong, those who are the same, and those who do not, those who are different."
7260,由于这项压力，加上两伊战争的军费不断上升，又由于市郊居民明显对宗教意识形态或宗教法明显不感兴趣，因此这场革命在不久之后就把打击对象转向这些来自乡下的支持者。,"As a result of this pressure, the rising cost of the war with Iraq, and the rather evident fact that the outskirts-dwellers had never been terribly interested in Islamic ideology or Koranic law, the revolution soon turned on its village-arrival supporters."
7260,1983年，在德黑兰的官员乞求他宣布紧急状态之后，霍梅尼认定人口迁徙是一大社会问题，必须加以遏止。,"In 1983, after Tehran officials begged him to declare a state of emergency, Khomeini deemed migration a “major social problem” that must be stopped."
7260,这样的态度与当初吸引城市贫民支持革命运动的说辞乃是一百八十度的大转变，更是对这些移民人口的潜在价值的彻底误解。,It was a complete reversal of the rhetoric that had led the urban poor to support the revolution in the first place and a complete misunderstanding of the potential value of these migrants.
7261,本世纪期间，位于世界经济核心的许多国家仍然还有许多工作要做，也就是世人皆知的“区域问题”。,"During the present century, there has been much work in many of the countries at the core of the world economy of what is almost universally known as the 'regional problem'."
7261,其主要表现就是某些地区的（相对）高失业率，这些地区的特征是依赖工业，而目前这些工业正在衰退。,The major manifestation of this has been (relatively) high unemployment rates in certain regions characterized by a dependence on industries which are in decline.
7261,这种衰退可能是由于对其产品的需求下降，更可能是由于对这些工业的投资转向了那些生产成本更低因而积累潜力更大的地区（这些地区可能在其他国家，某些还可能在市场之外几千英里，Thrift，1986)。,"The decline may be a result of a rail of demand for their products or, more likely, a consequence of a shift of investment in those industries to areas where production costs are lower and the potential for accumulation consequently greater (such areas may be in other countries, in some cases several thousand miles from the markets; Thrift, 1986)."
7262,时报广场成为象征之地，在这里，每一个人聚集在一起庆祝、哀悼或表达他们集体的愤怒、快乐和恐惧。,"Times Square became the symbolic place where everyone congregated to celebrate, mourn, or express their collective anger, joy, or fear."
7262,它是以政治经济模式生产出来并加以控制的，但却被平民以完全不同的方式加以挪用。,Produced and dominated in the mode of political economy it was appropriated by the populace in an entirely different fashion.
7262,它变成了再现一种独特想象的本真之地，即使作为物质社会实践的空间，它具有纯粹投机和商品化景观的全部特点。,"It became an authentic place of representation with a distinctive hold on the imagination, even though as a space of material social practices it had all the character of a purely speculative and commodified spectacle."
7263,任何形式的划分，任何形式的公共建筑，任何形式的税收评估政策，不管它们是多么的开明，最后都会在强大的经济压力之下败下阵来。,"Any forms of zoning, any forms of public building policy, any forms of tax assessment policy, no matter how enlightened,give eventually under sufficiently powerful economic pressure.They usually have and probably they usually will."
7263,这种情况曾经发生过，以后很可能还会继续发生。,
7263,因此，在采取保护性措施的同时，必须还要实行另外一种手段:竞争性分散。,Along with defensive tools must therefore go another: competitive diversion.
7264,相形之下，在自然地理学范围内，距离的概念仍然是强烈的绝对空间、以欧氏几何术语定义的空间、米制的空间。,"In comparison, within physical geography, concepts of distance have remained strongly absolute and defined in terms of Euclidean and metric space."
7264,也许我们本应指望一贯强调绝对空间的自然地理学家接受这项挑战，更侧重于空间分析。,"Perhaps physical geographers, with their ongoing emphasis on absolute space, could have been expected to take up the challenge and to focus more on spatial analysis."
7264,但是，他们一般都选择反对这种途径，贬低或无视空间分析。,"However, they have generally also chosen to reject this pathway and downgrade or neglect spatial analysis."
7265,其他的例子还有如心理学家试验中出现的行人所缺乏的“拔刀相助精神”，以及不愿相助陌生人的现象。,Other evidence of the lack of ‘bystander intervention’ and of an unwillingness to assist strangers comes from experiments contrived by psychologists.
7265,在某种程度上，类似的行为理所当然也是一种越轨行为。对于决定论而言，这种行为的作用在于它们滋生了更多更严重腐蚀社会责任感和社会控制力的越轨行为。,"Such behaviour is itself deviant to some extent, of course; but its significance to determinist theory is in the way in which it fosters the spread of more serious forms of deviancy by eroding social responsibility and social control."
7266,由于被剥夺了任何自主的生命力，自然容易根据人类的意志没有节制地被操纵。,"Deprived of any autonomous life force, nature was open to be manipulated without restraint according to the human will."
7266,如海德格尔后来抱怨的那样，自然成为人类开采的“巨大的加油站”。,"Nature became, as Heidegger later complained, ""one vast gasoline station"" for human exploitation."
7266,"按照法兰克福学派的意见，这种分析所忽略的是内部关系的辩证法，在其中，自然“既是某种外在于人类的东西又是一种内部现实"" (Jay，1973: 267)。","What this analysis elided, according to the Frankfurt School, was the dialectics of internal relations in which nature was both ""something external to man but also an internal reality"" (Jay, 1973: 267)."
7267,我们迫切地需要一种比当前所拥有的更加统一的社会科学和生物/物理科学的语言，履行对自然的共同责任。,We badly need a much more unified language than we currently possess for exercising the joint responsibility towards nature that resides with the social and biological/physical sciences.
7267,当然，科学的统一性问题已经提出多次了——特别是马克思（1964）。,"The question of the unity of science has, of course, been broached many times – not least by Marx (1964)."
7267,但是，每当援引生物学基础的时候，在社会理论方面就会出现严重的问题(熟悉的例子如，以社会达尔文主义为基础的纳粹主义，在社会生物学争论中产生的深刻的社会对抗性，以及特别是运用到种族范畴上的优生学运动的黑暗历史等等)。,"But serious problems have arisen on the social theory side whenever a biological basis has been invoked (familiar examples include the way social Darwinism founded Nazism, the profound social antagonisms generated in the debate over socio-biology and the dismal history of the eugenics movement particularly as applied to racial categories)."
7268,时空相关性理论表明：不同过程如何能够定义完全不同的时空性，并因此建立实体、位置和关系之完全不同的同一。,"The relational theory of spatio-temporality indicates how different processes can define completely different spatio-temporalities, and so set up radically different identifications of entities, places and relations."
7268,对莱布尼茨来说，这只是对可能世界的一种理论探究，并因此只受想象力限制。,For Leibniz this was simply a theoretical exploration of possible worlds and therefore solely confined to the imaginary.
7268,但对于怀特海(以及巴赫金和列斐伏尔)来说，依据被研究的过程之本质，这些完全不同的时空性及其相关制图法都被认为是真实的。,"But for Whitehead (and Bakhtin as well as Lefebvre), these radically different spatio-temporalities and their associated cartographies are construed as real, dependent upon the nature of the process being examined."
7269,无论如何，怀特海的批评源自牛顿传统自身。,"Whitehead's criticisms arise, however, from within the Newtonian tradition itself."
7269,就人类能够体验和描述这些过程来说，它们并不依赖以莱布尼茨方式对可能世界的逻辑揭示，而是依靠对实际自然过程的相关可能性进行研究。,"They do not rely on the logical exploration of possible worlds in the fashion of Leibniz, but on the study of relational possibilities of actual processes at work in nature, in so far as human beings can experience and describe them."
7269,怀特海主张，把自然分成事实与价值、心灵和物质、物质和意识是错误的，这时，尽管他确实脱离自然科学之抽象唯物主义传统，但由于他总是把自己的论证维系在人类身体经验的共与性上，从而仍然固守在经验主义的范围之中。,"While Whitehead does diverge from the abstract materialist tradition of natural science by insisting that the bifurcation of nature into facts and values, mind and matter, materiality and consciousness is false, he keeps firmly within the empiricist orbit by hinging his arguments always on the ""withness"" of human bodily experience."
7270,地统计学方法使得插值法的运用更为精确。,
7270,"最近一个应用这种技术的例子是伯特和帕克(Burt and Park,1999)对山坡地貌的研究,他们用线性克里格法做出一个山坡上的土壤特性空间分布模型。","A recent example of the use of such techniques in hillslope geomorphology can be found in Burt and Park (1999), who used linear kriging to model the spatial distribution of soil properties across a hillslope."
7270,"土壤样本从64个土坑中收集得来,每个土坑代表25m见方的取样网格。",Soil samples were collected from 64 soil pits based mainly on a 25 m sampling grid.
7271,在位方法和解释社会学、批评理论、女性主义视角和后现代主义范式相关。,"An emic approach is associated with the interpretive social sciences, critical theory, feminist perspectives and postmodern paradigms."
7271,研究焦点是由参与者和局中人的经历而得到的，强调主观性。,"The research foci are generated by the participants and the experiences of the insiders, with subjectivity being paramount."
7271,出位方法和实证主义和定量方法相关。,The etic approach is associated with the positivist paradigm and quantitative methodology.
7271,研究焦点是由研究者和从局外人的角度得到的资料产生的，强调客观性。,"The research foci are determined by the researcher and data are gathered from an outsider's viewpoint, with objectivity being paramount."
7272,主体性的地形学是多维的;因此是一种幻想。,"The topography of subjectivity is multidimensional; so, therefore, is vision."
7272,无论从哪个角度来说，认知自我都是部分的，而绝非完成了的、整体的、简单地存在和保持不变;它总是被构造的，并且被不完美地缝合在一起，因此能够同他人合作，共同地观察而不会主张变成他人。,"The knowing self is partial in all its guises, never finished, whole, simply there and original; it is always constructed and stitched together imperfectly, and therefore able to join with another, to see together without claiming to be another."
7272,这便是客观性的许诺;科学认知者寻求客观的而不是身份的主观位置；那便是部分联系的承诺。,Here is the promise of objectivity; a scientific knower seeks the subject position not of identity but of objectivity; that is of partial connection.
7272,(Haraway，1991:193),
7273,20世纪之初掀起了一场关于“大国”前途的充满焦虑的辩论。,The onset of the twentieth century provoked a rather anxious debate about the future of the ‘great powers’.
7273,许多人认为1900年标志着世界历史的转折点，是欧洲持续扩张400年的终结。,"Many believed that 1900 would mark a turning point in world history, the end of a 400-year period of continuous European expansion."
7273,世界地图上未探查过和未被认领的“空白”空间在迅速减少，或者看来是如此，“世界封闭”之意呼之欲出。,"The unexplored and unclaimed ‘blank’ spaces on the world map were rapidly diminishing, or so it seemed, and the sense of a ‘global closure’ was palpable."
7274,跨国公司可以挪用它使自己的全球掠夺合法化，以管理全部的世界资源。,It can be appropriated by multinational corporations to legitimize a global grab to manage all of the world's resources.
7274,实际上，不是不可能想象这样一个世界，在其中，大企业(某些部门)、强势政府(包括世界银行)和权势集团以及高技术的重大科学开始统治世界，甚至比当前更厉害。当前，它们以“可持续性”、生态现代化为名以及对假定很脆弱的地球健康进行适宜的全球管理。,"Indeed, it is not impossible to imagine a world in which big industry (certain segments), big governments (including the World Bank) and establishment, high-tech big science can get to dominate the world even more than they currently do in the name of ""sustainability,"" ecological modernization and appropriate global management of the supposedly fragile health of planet earth."
7275,作为一门“学科”，旅游学自然要利用其他学科而形成自己的研究过程和理论框架。,"As a 'discipline', tourism draws on these other disciplines to inform its research processes and theoretical frameworks."
7275,有人质疑旅游学是否可以作为一门独立学科而存在。,Some question whether tourism is yet a discipline in its own right.
7275,跨学科研究方法的发展以及对各种理论范式的应用都将推进旅游学成为一门学科的进程。,The development of an interdisciplinary approach to research and the construction and testing of various theoretical constructs and frameworks will establish tourism as a discipline with its own doctrine.
7276,垃圾场(junk yards)表现出的问题远比那些凋敝现象的斗士们想像的要复杂。,The trouble represenred by junk yards goes deeper than the Blight Fighters can plumb.
7276,如果只是叫喊“把它们清理走！它们不应该在这儿！”一点用处也没有。,"It achieves nothing to cry ""Take them away! They shouldn't be there!"""
7276,问题是要在一个地区里培育一种经济环境，使土地的使用不仅有利可图，而且合理。如果不能做到这点，土地还不如就让垃圾场占用，不管怎么样，这也是一种用途。,"The problem is to cultivate an economic environment in the district which makes more vital uses of the land profitable and logical If this is not done, the land might as well be used for junk yards, which after all have some use."
7277,在另一个极端上，除了直接感性的和沉思的经验世界，海德格尔完全拒绝任何意义的道德责任。,"Heidegger, at the other extreme, totally rejects any sense of moral responsibility beyond the world of immediate sensuous and contemplative experience."
7277,他拒绝通过国际劳动分工来研究商品的、货币的、技术的和生产的世界。,"He rejects any dealings with the world of commodity, money, technology, and production via any international division of labor."
7277,他把自己的视野限定在非常狭小的经验世界，以此来追问物之经验的先天和内在的性质。,He contracts his field of vision to a much narrower experiential world to ask questions about the innate and immanent qualities of experience of things.
7278,城市化动力和城市构造存在于一种基本的创造性张力，它为探究不同的物种存在模式提供联系。,The dynamic of urbanization and the construct of the city exist in a fundamental creative tension that provides the nexus to explore different modes of species being.
7278,不同时空秩序和结构的生产是社会过程中的积极因素。,The production of different spatio-temporal orderings and structures are active moments within the social process.
7278,我们通过城市化(过程)和城市(物)之间辩证关系所理解的东西，建构了一种至关重大的社会生态转型观点，并且因此建构了一种根本的反资本主义和亲社会主义斗争的观点。,"What we understand by the dialectical relation between urbanization (the process) and the city (the thing) constitutes a critical point of socio-ecological transformation and, consequently, a fundamental point of anti-capitalist and pro-socialist struggle."
7279,问题的措辞很重要——研究者应该使用简单的语言；做到用语简练、单意，避免引导性、含糊不清的问题；采用过滤性问题；恰当定义；适当的时间性框架；合理分类。,"The wording of the questions is important —researchers should use simple language; short, single-focused, nonleading, unambiguous questions; filter questions; definitions; temporal frames when appropriate; and categories."
7279,答案选项在本质上应该是穷尽的、互斥的和单一尺度的。,"Responses sets should be exhaustive, mutually exclusive and unidimensional in nature."
7279,答案选项的种类包括使用对照表、排序量表、李克特量表、语义差异量表和情景法。,"Response sets include the use of checklists, ranking scales, Likert scales, semantic differential scales and scenarios."
7280,特别要说明的是，巡游者的民族志研究使用了五种形式的三角校正：资料三角校正、调查者三角校正、理论三角校正、方法的三角校正（Denzin 1978)和跨学科三角校正(Janesick 1994，p.251)。,"Specifically, the ethnographic study of cruisers used fiveforms of triangulation: data triangulation, investigator triangulation,theory triangulation, methodological triangulation (Denzin 1978) and interdisciplinary triangulation (Janesick 1994, p. 251)."
7280,本文将只对与旅游动机相关的调查结果进行讨论。,Only the findings from the study that have relevance to travel motivations will be discussed in this paper.
7280,这些调查结果将按照前面讨论过的四种理论分类进行组织。,These findings are organised using each of the four 'theoretical' groupings previously discussed.
7281,在此强调可通约性是重要的。,The emphasis upon communicability is important here.
7281,它以一种令人感兴趣的方式预示了哈贝马斯（1987: 322）以交往行动理论来处理时空性的那种做法。,It prefigures in an interesting way Habermas's (1987: 322) treatment of spatio-temporality within his theory of communicative action.
7281,他写道，如果理性“在本质上体现于交往行动的语境中”，那么言语行动便把历史时间和社会空间中的”不同行动者的意图和行动联系起来了。,"If reason is ""by its very nature incarnated in contexts of communicative action,"" he writes, then speech acts connect the plans and actions of different actors ""in historical time and across social space."""
7282,历时研究是对同一或相似样本进行纵向的研究。,Longitudinal studies examine the same sample of people or a similar sample of people over time.
7282,历时研究的类型包括小样本多次调査、时间序列研究、趋势研究、世代分析以及案例研究。,"Types of longitudinal study include panel studies, time series studies, trend studies, cohort analysis and case studies."
7282,数据可通过焦点群体法、参与观察法、访谈法和文献法获得。,"Data may be collected using focus groups, participant observation, interviews and the documentary method."
7283,如果价值话语通过语言、制度、社会关系等中介力量而得以建立和交流，那么似乎没有什么方法把任何外部自然所固有的东西归于它们。,"If discourses about values are established and communicated through the mediating powers of language, institutions, social relations, and the like, then there seems no way to attribute anything intrinsic to external nature in them."
7283,为摆脱这种困难，克里考特从达尔文生物学转移到量子理论。,"To rescue his argument from this difficulty, Callicott shifts his terrain from Darwinian biology to quantum theory."
7283,他采取了一种在现代环境哲学中十分常见的行动：在表面上相似的生物学路线和当代物理学之间建立某种积极的联系。,"In so doing, he makes a move that is quite common in modern environmental philosophy: pursuing an active connection between seemingly analogous lines of thought in ecology and contemporary physics."
7284,任何研究中都有可能在假设检验中出现错误。,"In any study, there is always a possibility of error being introduced in the testing of hypotheses."
7284,错误可分为一类错误和二类错误两种类型。,The errors may be described as one of two types — Type I or Type II .
7284,一类错误发生在指零假设被证伪，而事实上该假设成立。,Type I errors occur when the null hypothesis is rejected when in fact it is true.
7284,二类错误发生在指当零假设事实上不成立但却被证实。,Type II errors occur when the null hypothesis is accepted when in fact it is false.
7284,表9 - 8概括了假设检验中产生的错误类型。,Table 9.8 outlines the types of error that may arise in hypothesis testing.
7285,但是，从相关的观点来看，竞争能够很容易地被视为一种合作形式。,But from a relational point of view competition can just as easily be seen as a form of cooperation.
7285,在第七章中讨论的领地例子便是一个明证。,"The example of territoriality examined in chapter 7, is an interesting case in point."
7285,不过，个体与个体之间激烈的竞争产生了一种被称为“社会”的合作性社会结果，这不也是自由主义的资本主义理论的根本宗旨吗？,"But is it not also a fundamental tenet of the liberal theory of capitalism that rampant competition between individuals produces a collaborative social effect called ""society?"""
7286,一个例子是1850年以后观察到的美国西北部南普拉特河（South Platte River）河道格局变化的事件：河流上游水库蓄水以后，河流从辫状水系变成了曲流的形式。,"An example is the observed event of a change in channel pattern on the South Platte River after 1850, from a braided to a meandering form, following reservoir impoundment in its headwaters."
7286,流量控制降低了年平均洪水位时河流的动力。,This control of flow reduced the stream power at the mean annual flood.
7286,曲流与辫状水系的阈限值出现在河流动力大约为50Wm−2时，但南普拉特河筑坝后在年平均洪水位时下降到大约2.5Wm−2。,"The threshold between meandering and braided patterns occurs at a stream power of about 50 Wm−2, but after impoundment, the stream power in the South Platte declined to about 2.5 Wm−2 at the mean annual flood."
7287,路访的程序包括选择时间和地点（比如每5年在国际机场）、制订时间表、调查出境的乘客、天数和时段。,"The process involves selecting a place and time, such as international airports every five years, as well as the schedules, outward-bound passengers, days and times."
7287,最后，要考虑参与者的个性特征——包括诸如性别、年龄和/或家庭生命周期等。,"Finally, consideration is given to the characteristics of the passengers who are to participate — selection may be by gender, age and/or family life cycle."
7287,路访涉及许多事项，比如问卷类型和调查方法。,"There are a number of issues associated with en-route surveys, and these relate to questionnaire and interview methods."
7287,单是抽样技术就包括概率抽样和非概率抽样两种（查阅第五章有关抽样的利弊以及各类抽样方法的讨论），同时还需兼顾与这些抽样技术相关的回应率和研究偏见等问题。,"Sampling is also an issue inregard to probability or non-probability samples (refer back to chapter 5 for the advantages and disadvantages of sampling and a discussion of the various sampling methods), as are responses rates and bias."
7287,有时，采用发放奖品激励受访者参与的方法来提高回应率。,"Sometimes, incentives are used to increase the response rate."
7288,对国内外旅游业来说，科学研究都是一种重要的工具。,Research is an important tool for the tourism industry nationally and internationally.
7288,私人和公共部门都对旅游研究有着浓厚的兴趣。,Both the private sector and the public sector are interested in tourism research.
7288,旅游研究为当地、地区、州、国内和国际层面上的规划、管理提供信息；为评价旅游的社会、环境和经济效应提供信息支持；有助于深入了解旅游者的旅游动机、旅游期望和满意水平；向旅游经营商和服务提供者强调教育需求。,"Tourism research provides information for planning and management at the local, regional, state, national and international levels.It provides information on the social, environmental and economic impacts of tourism.Tourism research offers insights into the motivations, needs, expectations and levels of satisfaction of tourists.It highlights educational needs for commercial operators and service providers."
7288,通过旅游研究，我们可以洞察旅游发展的过去、现在和未来。,"Tourism research generates temporal views of the past, present and future."
7288,旅游研究也为商业领域提供诸如市场营销和促销方面的资料支持，并且可供进行各种比较分析，也有助于各种政策的制定。,"It offers data for use in the business sphere, such as marketing and promotion, and allows comparisons to be made and policies to be developed."
7288,可以说，科学研究渗透于旅游业的各个方面。,The role of research in tourism is all pervasive in the overall tourism system.
7289,两种拉力相关动机是：寻求新奇和获得教育。,The two pull-related motives were novelty and education.
7289,"但是，无论这些“准理论”有多少种表述方式，他们都有相通之处：“描述的语言或许不同，以动机为出发点对旅游者进行分类所得到的数字或许不同，但是相同的主题反复出现。”（Ryan，1997b, p.27）对于这些准理论而言，相同的主题就是指推动因素和拉动因素。","However, despite the various presentations of the 'quasi-theories', there exist many similarities: '[t]he adjectives may differ; and the categorizations of tourists based upon motivations may differ in number, but recurrent themes emerge' Ryan (1997b, p. 27).For the quasi-theories, those themes were push and pull factors."
7290,最后，被哈特向及其前辈作为常识的马赛克地方观开始被看成是非常脱离实际的，在二战中和二战后都是如此。,"Finally, the mosaic view of place that seemed common sense to Hartshorne and his predecessors started to look highly unrealistic, both during and after the war."
7290,"如当时的一位地理学批评家所言，“我们不再与一个精妙地连成一个整体的世界打交道……我们的怀疑……(是)地理学家很可能正在试图为无关紧要的地区周围划上并不存在的界限。”(Kimble,1951/1996:499-500)","As one geographical critic of the time put it: ‘We are no longer dealing with a world of neatly articulated entities. ... Our suspicion ... [is] that ... geographers may perhaps be trying to put boundaries that do not exist around areas that do not matter’ (Kimble, 1951/1996: 500, 499)."
7291,把红色对我们感官产生的影响还原成它的纯粹物理概念，就如同把景观的意义还原成对它的地理要素的描绘，都会丧失美学经验追求的本质。,To reduce the impact of the color red upon our senses to its purely physical concept was to lose something in exactly the same way that the reduction of a landscape's meaning to a description of its geological components was to lose the essence of what esthetic experience was about.
7291,因此，必须在表象和直接效果层次上维持美学，更重要的是在总体性层次上来维持美学。,"Esthetics therefore had to remain at the level of surface appearance, immediate impact and, most important of all, at the level of the totality."
7291,如果不诉诸某种类似于莱布尼茨式奇想的东西，美学知识是很难达及的。,And esthetic knowledge was very hard to come by without resort to something akin to the Leibnizian conceit.
7292,揭示我们的“物种潜能”和“自我实现”能力，需要考虑生态计划与发起、实现和管理它们的社会关系之间的关系。,"Explorations of our ""species potential"" and our capacity for ""self-realization require that we take cognizance of the relation between ecological projects and the social relations needed to initiate, implement, and manage them."
7292,例如，如果要成功地控制核力量，就需要高度集中的和非民主的权力关系，再加上分等级的命令和控制结构。,"Nuclear power, for example, requires highly centralized and nondemocratic power relations coupled with hierarchical command and control structures if it is to work successfully."
7292,因此，在反对核力量时，既要集中关注它所带来的生态难题一[——]健康和长期的危险核废料，又要集中于它所暗示的社会关系。,Objections to it therefore focus as much on the social relations it implies as on the ecological problems of health and long-term hazardous wastes.
7292,同样，在苏联实施的许多生态计划，它们在本质上需要一种社会关系，在根本上与建设一种以平等和民主为基础的新社会之理论计划并不相符[。],The nature of many of the ecological projects undertaken in the Soviet Union likewise required social relations that were fundamentally at odds with the theoretical project of constructing a new society founded on egalitarianism and democracy.
7293,"采用定性方法进行数据收集和分析的一个关键原则就是：“如果我们确实要理解人们的想法，必须基于他们的观念对其经历进行完整分析，而非基于我们的观念”（Boas 1943, p. 314）。","The key principle of a qualitative approach to data collection and analysis is that ' if it is our serious purpose to understand the thoughts of a people, the whole analysis of experience must be based on their concepts, not ours' (Boas 1943, p. 314)."
7293,这要通过“理解”（Weber 1978）——移情式理解来达到（参见第二章)。,"This is achieved through 'verstehen' (Weber 1978) — that is, empathetic understanding (see chapter 2)."
7293,在研究设计中，指导定性方法论运用的理论范式非常之多，这其中包括符号互动主义、现象学、启发式询问、常人方法论和民族志。,"There are a number of theoretical positions that inform the use of a qualitative methodological framework in research design.Some of these theoretical positions include symbolic interactionism, phenomenology, heuristic inquiry, ethnomethodology and ethnography."
7294,案例研究法有时会与民族志或参与观察法相混淆（Yin 1994)。,Case studies are sometimes confused with ethnography or participantobservation (Yin 1994).
7294,它们其实是不同的。,
7294,,"However, they are not the same."
7294,实际上，案例研究可以综合运用参与观察法和民族志来收集某个案例或系列案例的数据。,"In fact, case studiesincorporate the use of participant observation and ethnography as part of the repertoire of methods that may be used to gather data on a specific case or set of cases."
7295,“明智利用”运动还有其他两个论据，来进一步强烈地捍卫私有财产不受政府约束。,"The ""wise use"" movement has two other arguments which it adds to its strong defense of private property against governmental constraints."
7295,第一个论据是，工作（因此也就是经济发展和资本积累）的权利必须优先于“自然的权利”（无论对此如何理解，如果有的话）。,"The first is that the right to jobs (and hence economic development and capital accumulation) must take precedence over the ""rights of nature"" (however the latter may be construed, if at all)."
7295,“明智利用”运动以零和论据而名噪一时，这种论据把美国西北部斑点鹰的命运与伐木业的就业机会对立起来。,"The ""wise use"" movement thrives on zero-sum arguments of the sort that pitted the fate of the spotted owl in the US northwest against employment opportunities in logging."
7296,经济理论基本上是一个模型的集合。,Economic theory is essentially a collection of models.
7296,深刻的见解如果不用模型的形式表述出来，也许暂时能够吸引人们的注意力，甚至吸引虔诚的信徒，但是除非以一种可重复和可传授的方式加以整理，否则它们长久不了。,"Broad insights that are not expressed in model form may temporarily attract attention and even win converts, but they do not endure unless codified in a reproducibleand teachable form."
7296,你也许并不喜欢这种潮流；当然，经济学家太轻易忽视没有模型化的思想（尽管我相信重视模型基本上是正确的）。,You may not like this tendency; certainly economists tend to be too quick to dismiss what has not been formalized (although I believe that the focus on models is basically right).
7297,如果这个办法可以解决城市街道的危险问题，那么洛杉矶就应该是安全的城市，因为从外表上看，洛杉矶几乎已完全郊区化了。它已没有真正意义上的可以称得上是人口密度高的城市 地区了。,"If this could solve danger on the city streets, then Los Angeles should be a safe city because superficially Los  Angeles' is almost all suburban, It has virtually no districts compact enough  qualify as dense city areas."
7297,但是，就像别的城市一样，洛杉矶不能避开这个事实， 即作为一个城市，它拥有很多陌生人，他们中总有一些人会带来麻烦。,"Yet Los  Angeles cannot, any more than any other great city, evade the truth that, being a city, it is composed of strangers not all of whom are nice."
7297,洛杉矶的犯罪数字可以让人目瞪口呆。,Los Angeles'crime figures are flabbergasting.
7298,使用就近抽样或目标式抽样时，通常由研究者决定抽取多少研究单位或参与者，其具体尺度视何时出现冗余资料而定。,"In using convenience or purposive sampling, the researcher decides when enough participants or units have been sampled.This occurs when there is redundancy in regard to data."
7298,换言之，什么时候停止抽取样本单位并非预先确定的，而是视研究进程和对资料的初步分析而定。,"The cut-off is not predetermined, but emerges as an outcome of the research process and concurrent data analysis."
7298,在定性研究中，决定抽样规模的是资料的“性质”而不是“数量”（Saramakos 1998）。,"With qualitative research, it is the 'quality', not the 'quantity', of the data that determines the sample size (Sarantakos 1998)."
7299,这也是克里斯蒂娃(Kristeva， 1986)依据一种女性主体性直接提出来的问题。她指出，那种主体性同循环的时间(重复)和不朽的时间(永恒)联系在一起，而同时却被排除在“具有开端、发展和终结的目的论的”历史和计划的线性时间之外。,"This is an issue which Kristeva (1986) addresses directly in terms of a female subjectivity which is linked, she argues in one of her most important essays, to cyclical times (repetition) and monumental time (eternity), while being excluded from the linear time of history, of projects, ""teleology, departure, progression and arrival."""
7299,后一种时间与生产联系在一起，然而，前一种时间则主要地与再生产，“物种生存、生死、身体、性别以及象征”联系在一起。,"The last is very much about production whereas the former relates primarily to reproduction, ""survival of the species, life and death, the body, sex and symbol."""
7300,内部关系概念需要本体概念，作为行动，把各种关系综合进它外存在特点。,The concept of internal relations requires the concept of substance as the activity synthesising the relationships into its emergent character.
7300,因为它本身是多种关系的统一，事件是它所是之物。,"The event is what it is, by reason of the unification in itself of a multiplicity of relationships."
7300,"(Whitehead, 1985:155)","(Whitehead, 1985:155)"
7301,内容分析也是坚持女性主义范式的研究者所使用的特殊工具，被称为女性主义内容分析（Reinharz 1992)。,Content analysis is also a specific tool used by feminist researchers and is called feminist content analysis (Reinharz 1992).
7301,它也是“后现代主义”研究者的一种分析方法。,I t is also a method of analysis for 'postmodern' researchers.
7301,马丁（Martin）给出了一个通过解构分析方法进行女性主义内容分析的实例：我以女性主义的视角来……解构并重构某一情境，看它意味着什么，不意味着什么，或者它可能已经表达了什么。,"An example of the way feminist content analysis is undertaken using a deconstructionist analytic method is given by Martin : I deconstruct and reconstruct ... [the] story from a feminist viewpoint, examining what it says, what it does not say, and what it might have said."
7301,"这种分析关注的是情境中隐含的性别冲突……并企图彰显那些貌似善意的组织行为是如何实践着而不是避免着性别歧视的（Martin, in Reinharz 1992，p.149)。","This analysis highlights suppressed gender conflicts implicit in . . . [the] story and shows how apparently well-intentioned organizational practices can reify, rather than alleviate, gender inequalities (Martin, in Reinharz 1992, p. 149)."
7302,批评者常常认为，尽管马克思主义理论原则上限于关注阶级冲突，但他们对人类能动性 (human agency)(也就是人们选择以及朝着他们的目标行动的能力）缺乏意识。,It is frequently argued by critics that Marxian theories also have a poor sense of human agency (i.e.the capacity of people to make choices and take actions to affect their destinies).
7302,他们认为，在马克思主义理论中人经常被描绘成被广泛的经济力量所包围的不幸的受骗者。,It is argued that within Marxian theory people are frequently portrayed as hapless dupes thrown about by broader economic forces.
7302,但是，人在这些经济力量面前是无能的，这一点毋容置疑。,"Nevertheless, it is undoubtedly true that many people are relatively defenceless in the face of economic forces."
7303,正是在这一阶段，我们可以将后福特主义与城市地区的结构变化相联系。,It is at this stage that we can finally begin to link up neo-Fordism with the changing structure of urban areas.
7303,新的后福特主义技术和工作实践产生的最主要影响之一是制造同一产品所需的人数越来越少了。,One of the main consequences of neo-Fordist technologies and working practices is that far fewer people are needed to manufacture things.
7303,此外，已经为大众所接受的“成熟”产品的生产被转移到西方国家以外的低成本地区。,"In addition, the production of well-established ‘mature’products has often been shifted to low-cost locations outside the Western nations."
7303,其结果是大量的逆工业化（deindustrialization)及古典工业化城市的相继转型。,The result has been massive deindustrialization and the consequent transformation of the classic industrial city.
7304,虽然现在地理学家以更加挑剔的方式研究视觉影像，但许多艺术史学家和电影理论家已经开始把视觉影像的空间性（spatiality）作为他们工作的中心。,"While geographers now study visual images in more critical ways, a number of art historians and film theorists have begun to make the spatiality of visual images central to their work."
7304,在寻求使旁观者与凝视的性别空间性的形象化与使事件融入背景方面，女性主义者的工作别具影响力。,
7304,,Feminist work has been particularly influential in seeking to embody and contextualize the gendered spatiality of spectatorship and the gaze.
7304,"作为此类工作的一个例子，格丽塞尔达•波洛克（Griselda Pollock, 1988）以明晰的空间方法剖析了两幅女性印象派画家的画。","As one example of such work, Griselda Pollock (1988) analyses the paintings of two female Impressionists in explicitly spatial ways."
7305,"知识和学科结构是社会模式，这就是为什么西方社会在研究世界其他地区的时候经常会遭遇民族偏见的原因（E.Said, 1978)。","Knowledge and disciplinal structure are social constructs, which is why Western societies often suffer ethnocentric bias when studying other parts of the world (E. Said, 1978)."
7305,这是性别地理学给整个研究领域带来的众多观点中的其中一个。,This is one of many notions that gender geography presents to the field as a whole.
7305,与其他专业方向相似，女权主义地理学产生了自己的团体和自己的杂志。,"As with other specializations, feminist geography has produced its own groups and its own journals."
7306,总之，女性主义范式认为女性是被统治阶级，而男性是统治阶级。这导致女性被压迫和征服。,"To summarise, the feminist perspectives paradigm involves the world viewthat women are the subject class and men the ruling class, and that subsequently women have been oppressed and subjugated."
7306,主要有四种女性主义视角：激进女性主义、马克思主义和社会主义女性主义、自由女性主义和后现代女性主义。,"There are four major feminist perspectives: radical feminism, Marxist and socialist feminism, liberal feminism and postmodern feminism."
7306,女性主义研究者与被研究的女性之间的关系是主观的，并以互利为基础。,The relationship between feminist researchers and the women they are studying is subjective and based on reciprocity.
7306,这种方法论的目的在于改变女性无话语权的状况、增强自我意识感、授权和转型（Cook & Fonow 1990)。,"The methodology aims to correct the silencing of women's voices, and emphasises consciousness-raising, empowerment and transformation (Cook & Fonow 1990)."
7306,所使用的具体方法主要源自定性研究方法论框架。,The methods used are drawn from a qualitative methodological framework.
7307,配额抽样与分层抽样（一种随机抽样技术）的不同在于后者把总体随机划分为若干层，而前者是有意识地决定每个层级中的单位数目，然后采用就近抽样抽取样本的方法。,Quota sampling differs from stratified sampling (a random sampling technique) in that the latter divides the population into strata by random selection and the former determines the numbers in each strata then follows up with convenience sampling.
7307,萨兰塔克斯（Samntakos，1998）建议我们应该把配额抽样描述为非随机比例分层抽样。,Sarantakos (1998) suggests that we could describe quota sampling as non-random proportional stratified sampling.
7307,它也可以称为混合抽样（Kumar 1996）或准随机抽样。,It is also described as mixed sampling (Kumar 1996) or quasirandom sampling.
7308,批评理论范式介于主观主义和客观主义之间，认为世界是由规则控制的。,Critical theory paradigm uses a mid-point between subjectivism and objectivism and sees the social world as constrained by rules.
7308,这些规则可以被活动者及其行为改变。,"However, these rules are able to be changed by actors and their actions."
7308,此范式的科学调查可以引起变革，且研究的目的是改变所研究的社会环境。,Scientific inquiry in this paradigm should elicit transformational change and the purpose of the research is to change the social circumstances of those being studied.
7308,此范式主要使用定性研究方法。,"Primarily, qualitative research methodology is applied."
7309,使用集中趋势量数以及频数分布的图形描述，调査者能够陈述频数分布的本质。,"Using the measures of central tendency and graphical representation of frequency distributions, researchers can make statements about the nature of frequency distributions."
7309,分布既有正态分布也有偏态分布。,
7309,,Distributions can be normal or skewed.
7309,在正态分布中，平均值、中位数及众数集中在一点上，用一个钟形曲线表示[参见图9 - 8(a)]。,"In normal distributions, the mean, median and mode are clustered around the same point and represent a bell-shaped curve (see figure 9.8(a))."
7310,描述频数分布的其他方法有折线图、直方图、地图绘制法以及人口锥形图。,"Other methods of representing frequency distributions are polygons, histograms, cartographs and population pyramids."
7310,折线图是由直线连接的点构成的，大多用于离散数据。,Polygons consist of dots joined by lines and are mostly used with interval data.
7310,直方图是由彼此挨着的垂直长方条构成的。,Histograms are graphs with vertical bars adjoining each other.
7310,连接这些长方条的中点，就能够制成频数的折线图。,These can be made into a frequency polygon by joining the midpoints of the bars.
7310,"地图绘制法在地图上描述频数,形象地确定了所描述变量的位置和重要性(Sanmtakos 1998)。",Cartographs demonstrate frequencies on a map to visually identify the location and magnitude of the variable being represented (Sarantakos 1998).
7310,人口锥形图通常描述两个变量（例如，性别和年龄）来彼此互相对比，它是使用水平位置的线条来描述频数的。,Population pyramids usually portray two variables (such as sex and age) in comparison to each other using horizontally positioned bars to represent the frequencies.
7311,在自然地理学中线性世界表现为对平衡状态趋同的思想。,"In physical geography, the linear world is represented by the idea of convergence on an equilibrium state."
7311,平衡是一个数学概念，在平衡中变化率为零。,Equilibrium is a mathematical concept in which the rate of change is zero.
7311,一般把平衡视为被观察系统处于无变化状态。,It is generally taken to indicate a non-changing state of the system under observation.
7312,这样的“死寂地带”实际上可以是一块空地，或者是很少被光临的某个纪念物，或者是一个停车场，或者干脆就是几个银行——在下午3点后，这些地带就会空寂一片。,"Such a dead-place may be an actual vacancy, or it may be a little-used monument of some sort, or it may be a parking lot, or it may simply be a group of banks that go dead after three o'clock in the afternoon."
7312,不管是哪种形式，这种“死寂地带”扮演的地理障碍角色击败了它的普通土地(general land)用途的促进者的角色。,"Whatever it may be specifically,  the role of the dead place as a geographic obstacle to the general land has overcome its role as a contributor of users to the general land."
7312,这两者 之间的对峙平衡的关系开始松弛了。,The tension has gone slack.
7313,发起人可能会要求研究者隐藏发起人的身份（上面关于欺骗的讨论与此相关）。,A sponsor may request the researcher to withhold the sponsor's identity(the above discussion on deception has relevance here as well).
7313,发起人也可能试图隐藏研究的目的。,A sponsormay also seek to have the purpose of their research masked.
7313,巴比（1990，P.340)就此提出了一些观点。,"Babbie (1990,p. 344) offers some guidance."
7313,他解释道，研究者并不总是完全了解他们的研究将作何用。,He notes that researchers cannot always befully cognisant of how their research will be used.
7313,一旦为发起人完成了研究，有关成果将可能会作其他的分析之用，且研究者不能将此目的告知参与者。,"Once the research is completed for a sponsor, it may be used for other analytical purposes to which the researcher is not privy and so therefore cannot inform the participants"
7314,在这个例子里，卡内基大厅是一个强有力的棋子（chessmen），与其他棋子进行着非常有效的合作。,"In this case, Carnegie Hall is  a vital chessman, working in concert with other chessmen."
7314,如果说有什么可以毁掉这个地方的话，那就是迁移走卡内基大厅，换上一个写字楼。,The most ruinous plan that could be devised for this enrire neighborhood would be to destroy Carnegie Hall and replace it with another office building.
7314,而这实际上就是险些在这里发生的事。,
7315,然而，全球化过程并非新鲜事。,"Yet, the process of globalization is not new."
7315,无疑，1492年以降，甚至更早(参考汉撒同盟体系)，资本主义全球化就部分地通过创造城市网络而开始了。,"Certainly from 1492 onwards, and even before (cf. the Hanseatic league system), the globalization of capitalism was well under way in part through the production of a network of urban places."
7315,马克思恩格斯在《共产党宣言》中就强调过这个观点。,Marx and Engels emphasized the point in The Communist Manifesto.
7315,他们写道，现代工业不只是开拓了世界市场，而且不断扩大产品销路的需要“驱使资产阶级奔走于全球各地”，以至于“它必须到处落户，到处开发，到处建立联系” 。,"Modern industry not only creates the world market, they wrote, but the need for a constantly expanding market ""chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe"" so that it ""must nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connections everywhere."""
7316,因而，位置是惰性身体的场所，可以还原为某种永久性事物的“在那里”，与创造空间之运动的不稳定性相反。,"Place is, then, the site of the inert body, reducible to the ""being there"" of something permanent, in contrast to the instabilities of motions creating space."
7316,但是，“当一个意志或权力主体(如一个经营者、企业、城市或科研机构)能够从环境中独立出来时”，便产生了战略性的“力量关系的计算”。,"But a strategic ""calculus of force-relationships"" arises ""when a subject of will and power (a proprietor, an enterprise, a city, a scientific institution) can be isolated from an environment."""
7316,就其成为“意志和权力主体”而言，永恒性的形成改变着行动的计算。,
7316,,"The achievement of permanences alters the calculus of action in so far as they become ""subjects of will and power."""
7317,在一个极具表现力的差异世界里揭示制图的类同和统一，这似乎越来越成为时代的关键问题。,Uncovering cartographic affinities and unities within a world of highly expressive difference appears more and more as the key problematic of the times.
7317,这是任何辩证的历史地理唯物主义理论都必须完成的政治使命。,This is the political mission that any dialectical theory of historical-geographical materialism must address.
7317,但是，正如资本所为，这项使命必须依赖协同的/共存性的时空性整体的建设，与社会的、物质实践的、制度的和权力关系的世界保持着积极关系。,"But it is a mission that depends, as does capital, on the construction of an ensemble of cogredient/compossible spatio-temporalities in active relation to the world of social and material practices, institutions, and power relations."
7318,即使资本主义的短期历史也确切地证明，资源并非一成不变的，所有资源都是动态的和不断变化的。,"Even the short history of capitalism surely proves that resources are not fixed, that all of them are dynamic and changing."
7318,资本主义在特定状态中正遭遇它自己造成的生态稀缺和人口过剩状况，这只不过是一种说法。,It is one thing to say that capitalism in a given state is encountering a condition of ecoscarcity and overpopulation of its own distinctive making.
7318,据马克思的说法，实际上，可以有力地证明，作为生产方式，资本主义必然总是那样做，所以，把这种特殊的环境转化成一种普遍的限制就是完全取消了政治的—生态的立场。,"Indeed, it can be argued with some force, pace Marx, that capitalism as a mode of production necessarily must always do that, so that to translate this particular circumstance into a set of universal limitations is to completely elide the political-ecological point."
7319,事实上，人文地理学多样化的传统与方法在这些接口上造就了广阔的科研与教学范围，在人文科学与社会科学之间以及这两门学科内部，形成了维系各种资料来源、方法和思想的建设性联系。,"Indeed, the diverse traditions and approaches within human geography have shaped a wide range of research and teaching located at these interfaces, making productive connections that span sources, methods and ideas both within and between the humanities and social sciences."
7319,1989年丹尼斯•科斯格罗夫（Denis Cosgrove）写道：“人文地理学作为人文科学的思想未成熟，亦未充分展开。”此后情况发生了很大变化。,Much has changed since Denis Cosgrove wrote that ‘the idea of human geography as a humanity is scarcely a mature or fully developed one’ (1989: 121).
7320,对本书来说， 序言也作如是观。在一门具有各种哲学竞争之特征的学科中，应当对学生们介绍这些哲学，陈述它们的基本原理和它们与人文地理学的关联。,"In a discipline characterized by competition between a variety of philosophies, students need an introduction to those philosophies, a statement of their fundamentals and of their relevance to human geography."
7320,这种介绍可以用多种方式进行，这里所选择的方式可能是最简单的。,Such an introduction can be provided in a variety of ways.That chosen here is perhaps the simplest.
7321,但是，人行道以及走在上面的行人不是被动的安全受益者，或无助的危险受害者。,But sidewalks and those who use them are not passive beneficiaries of safety or helpless victims of danger.
7321,在城市里文明与野蛮行为的斗争中，人行道和其周边的地方以及它们的使用者都是积极的参与者。,"Sidewalks, their bordering uses, and their users, are active participams in the drama of civilization versus barbarism in cities."
7321,维护城市的安全是一个城市的街道和人行道的根本任务。,To keep the city safe is a fundamenral task of a city's streets and its sidewalks.
7322,在1950年代1960年代，实证主义是人文地理学研究中一种广为流行的认识论。,Positivism was a popular epistemology within human geography in the 1950s and 1960s.
7322,它认为世界的各个层面都是可知的，“科学”的应用将会为我们揭开世界上所有秘密。,It argued that the world was knowable in all its facets and that the application of ‘science’ would reveal this world to us.
7322,实证主义者相信世界可以被“客观地”了解。,Positivists believe that the world can be understood ‘objectively’.
7322,另一方面，后实证主义认为永远也不可能全面地了解世界，我们对事物的理解总是片面的。,
7323,我们建立正义行动——在其中，“剥夺者被剥夺了”——犹豫不决，就是因为暴力因素会永远留下其痕迹(直到被下一步的暴力行动所消除)。,"We shrink from any founding act of justice in which ""the expropriators are expropriated"" precisely because it is a moment of violence that will forever leave its trace (until expunged by some further act of violence)."
7323,我们拒绝制度化的法律专制，因为它形成一个顽固的“永恒性”，阻止社会变革的流动性。,"We refuse the institutionalized arbitrariness of law because it forms as a recalcitrant ""permanence"" in the face of the fluidity of social change."
7323,而且，我们把物还原为流，拒绝思考那些“永恒性”的结构——它们可以给社会存在以秩序并给社会生成以方向。,"And, reducing everything to flows, we refuse to contemplate the construction of those ""permanences"" that can give order to social being and direction to social becoming."
7324,定量研究方法包括：问卷调查法、结构化访谈法、历时研究法、案例研究法、文献档案法、模型法、观察法、准试验法和影响评估法等。,"Quantitative methods include questionnaires and structured interviews, longitudinal studies, case studies, the documentary method, modelling, observation, the quasi-experimental method and impact assessment methods."
7324,定量分析包括：包含集中趋势量数的描述性统计、相关性测量和推断性统计。,"Analysis involves descriptive statistics including measures of central tendency, measures of association and inferential statistics."
7324,计算机为研究的设计和分析提供了附加工具和一些用于定量分析的软件包，例如Methodologist’s Toolchest、SphinxSurvey、SPSS、Minitab、SAS和winMAX 等。,"Computer s provide an additional tool in research designing and analysis, and some quantitatively based software packages include Methodologist's Toolchest , SphinxSurvey, SPSS , Minitab, SAS and winMAX ."
7325,时间和空间构成宇宙的基本物理维度。,Time and space form the basic physical dimensions of the universe.
7325,这样，我们用时间量度变化，包括社会变化。,"As such, time is used to measure change, including societal change."
7325,社会时间表示含有内容的时间：变化过程中的人文现象。,Social time indicates time with content: human phenomena in the process of change.
7325,社会时间与社会空间作为“时空”而永恒地联系在一起。,Social time is invariably linked to social space as ‘time-space’.
7326,沃勒斯坦提出的世界系统分析为人文地理学中对时间与空间关系提供了一种可供选择的唯物主义解释。,World-systems analysis as developed by Wallerstein offers an alternative materialist interpretation of the relations between time and space in human geography.
7326,为了强调这两个概念的永久性，他杜撰了“时空” —词来形容其特殊的综合。,To emphasize the indissolubility of the two concepts he coins the word TimeSpace to describe his particular integration.
7326,从布劳德尔界定3类社会时间——短期、中期和长期——开始，沃勒斯坦通过把空间尺度添加到每个时间跨度上增加一个地理成分。,"Starting with Braudel’s identification of three categories of social time – the short term, the medium term, and the long term – Wallerstein adds a geographical component by attaching a spatial scale to each temporal span."
7327,环境话语和社会正义原则之间的对比暗示着它们之间的天然联系。,"A comparison of environmental discourses and principles of social justice, suggests a crude set of pairings."
7327,功利主义的正义理论与标准观点有着强大的联系。,Utilitarian theories of justice are strongly associated with the standard view.
7327,在发达资本主义社会中，很明显并存着这两种话语，这成为调整制度行为、政治行动和物质实践方面最流行和最霸权的思考方式。,"The intermingling of both these discourses in the advanced capitalist societies is fairly evident making this by far the most prevalent and hegemonic mode of thinking for regulating institutional behaviors, political action, and material practices."
7328,社会主义事业必须包容并寻求从那种冷漠的商品化同质性中解放出来。,The socialist cause must encompass and seek emancipation from that bland commodified homogeneity.
7328,这不是主张一种无拘无束的相对主义或者不受限制的后现代折衷主义，而是主张对共性/差异、一个人的特殊性和其他人的普遍性之间关系进行严肃讨论。,"This is not a plea for an unchecked relativism or unconstrained postmodem eclecticism, but for a serious discussion of the relations between commonality/difference, the particularity of the one and the universalism of the other."
7328,必须把社会主义理解成一种政治规划、一种有关社会如何运行的替代性视野、一种有关社会生态关系如何展开的别样洞见、一种有关人类潜能如何实现(尽管是在差异地理学之中)的标新立异想象。,"Socialism has to be understood as a political project, as an alternative vision of how society will work, how socio-ecological relations will unfold, how human potentialities can be realized albeit within a geography of difference."
7329,反机构化最极端的结果发生在加利福尼亚州。,The most extreme consequences of deinstitutionalization are to be found in California.
7329,该州精神病院的迅速关闭导致服务依赖型集聚区（service-dependent ghettos)的出现也被称为无墙庇护所 (asylum-without-walls)。,The rapid closure of psychiatric hospitals in the state led to the creation of service-dependent ghettoes.
7329,从前的隐性精神病人被限制在环境恶劣的邻里中，而规划立法则将基于社区的设施规划在更加富裕的地区。,Former in-patients have become restricted to poorer-quality neighbourhoods as zoning legislation has kept community-based facilities outside more affluent areas.
7329,为了获得利益，基于社区的服务业已经得到了发展，但是其中一些服务业相对规模较大，拥有一百多名从业者，并且已经开始具有一些老的精神病院的机构特征。,For-profit community-based services have been developed but some of these are now relatively large with over a hundred occupants and are beginning to reproduce some of the institutional features of the older mental hospitals.
7330,深度访谈采取半结构化的形式，辅以有关巡游和游艇的财产调查、旅游活动和预算等内容的调查问卷。,"The in-depth interviews were semi-structured in nature and were supplemented by questionnaires relating to cruising and yacht inventories, tourism activities and budgetary items."
7330,这些方法是对参与观察阶段的补充。,These methods were complemented with periods of participant observation.
7330,1986-1992年间，研究人员是“完全的参与者”（Junker 1960；and Gans 1982），成为‘其中一员(Adler &：Adler 1983)。,"During 1986 to 1992, the researcher was a 'complete'/'total participant' (Junker 1960; and Gans 1982) having 'complete membership' (Adler & Adler 1983)."
7331,因此，植物群落或生境以及生态系统的划分与随后的制图充满困难。,The process of defining and then mapping plant communities or habitats and hence ecosystems is thus fraught with difficulty.
7331,能够具体表现的细节水平常常很低，植被类型降低为概括化的生境，生境之间界线的划分常常是武断的。,"Often the level of detail that can be incorporated is low, and vegetation categories are reduced to generalized habitats and definition of boundaries between habitats is often arbitrary."
7331,1980年代和1990年代英国所进行的植物群落制图工作中第一阶段的生境制图计划提供了一个出色的例子。,The phase 1 habitat mapping programme for the mapping of plant communities in Britain during the 1980s and 1990s provides an excellent example.
7332,因此，植物群落或生境以及生态系统的划分与随后的制图充满困难。,The process of defining and then mapping plant communities or habitats and hence ecosystems is thus fraught with difficulty.
7332,能够具体表现的细节水平常常很低，植被类型降低为概括化的生境，生境之间界线的划分常常是武断的。,"Often the level of detail that can be incorporated is low, and vegetation categories are reduced to generalized habitats and definition of boundaries between habitats is often arbitrary."
7332,1980年代和1990年代英国所进行的植物群落制图工作中第一阶段的生境制图计划提供了一个出色的例子。,The phase 1 habitat mapping programme for the mapping of plant communities in Britain during the 1980s and 1990s provides an excellent example.
7332,"概括化水平常常是如此之高，以致所制成的成果图相对地没有什么价值，出于各种实际理由，许多此类图件的精度因而受到质疑（Cherrill and McClean, 1999）。","The level of generalization was often so high as to render the final maps as of comparatively little value, and for various practical reasons, the accuracy of many of the maps has subsequently been questioned (Cherrill and McClean, 1999)."
7333,让我们来研究一下沃尔夫—萨皮尔假说。,
7333,,"Consider, for example, the implications of accepting what is known as the Whorf-Sapir hypothesis."
7333,这个假说源自对土著美洲人文化的人类学研究，它认为，在对“同一种”现实进行感知、理解和行动时，本土美洲人与欧洲人完全不同。,"This view arose out of anthropological studies of native-American cultures and the realization that there was a radical difference in how native-Americans and Europeans perceived, understood, and acted towards the ""same"" reality."
7333,例如，从本土美洲人的观点看，空间和时间具有相当不同且不可同化的意义（这种观点在下文讨论中将被采纳）。,"Space and time, for example, had quite different and unassimilable meanings from the standpoint of native-Americans (this point will be taken up later)."
7334,实验绝不是纯经验主义的，它取决于理论的深度与谨慎的逻辑。,Experimentation is never pure empiricism; it relies on theoretical depth and careful logic.
7334,但其反面也是正确的; 理论也需要对照经验证据来评价，以展示其可供世人借鉴的价值。,"But the converse is also true; theory requires evaluation against empirical evidence, to demonstrate its value as a mirror held up to the world."
7334,从这些关于野外科学实验设计的书籍中吸取教训是一种极其艰巨的过程，在地理学某些领域中，应用必要的精密性的传统已被摈弃。,"The lessons learnt from books on experimental design in the field sciences are that such empirical evaluation is an extremely arduous process, and in some areas of geography, the tradition of applying the necessary rigour has been abandoned."
7335,反对统治团结和合并团结的理论和实践斗争，不仅摧毁了父权制、殖民主义、人道主义、实证主义、本质主义、科学主义以及其他无人惋惜的各种主义的正当性，而且全都要求有机的或自然的立场。,"The theoretical and practical struggle against unity-through-domination or unity-through-incorporation ironically not only undermines the justifications for patriarchy, colonialism, humanism, positivism, essentialism, scientism, and other unlamented -isms, but all claims for an organic or natural standpoint."
7335,我认为，激进的和社会主义/马克思主义的女权主义者也破坏了他们的/我们自己的认识论战略，而这是想象各种可能团结的重要步骤。,"I think that our radical and socialist/Marxist feminisms have also undermined their/our own epistemological strategies, and this is a crucially valuable step in imagining possible unities."
7335,"(Haraway, 1991:157)",
7335,,(p. 157)
7336,如第六章提到的，历时研究可以分为小样本多次调查、时间序列研究、趋势研究、世代分析以及案例研究。,"As noted in chapter 6, longitudinal studies can be described as panel studies, time series studies, trend studies and cohort analysis studies, as well as case studies."
7336,历时研究方法也可以由这些类型混合而成。,Longitudinal studies may also constitute a mix of these types.
7336,每种类型都由定量方法论指导（或一种定性方法论，参见第六章）。,"Each type can be informed by a quantitative methodology (or a qualitative methodology, see chapter 6)."
7337,郊区的兴起是十足由美国领导的社会转变过程，代表了一种有时被称为美国霸权周期的元素。,The rise of the suburb was very much a US-led process of social change and represents an element of what is sometimes called the American hegemonic cycle.
7337,这是沃勒斯坦主义周期性意识形态时空概念的一部分。,This is part of a Wallersteinian cyclical-ideological TimeSpace.
7337,在世界系统分析中，现代世界已经通过3个霸权周期而发展，每个周期都是以世界性霸权国家经济上的成功为基础的。,"In world-systems analysis, the modern world-system has developed through three hegemonic cycles, each based upon the economic successes of a world hegemonic state."
7338,我在此所概述的各种立场绝不是相互排斥的，人们可以发现各种思想路线之间的相互征用。,The positions I have here outlined are by no means mutually exclusive and all kinds of cooptations from one line of thought to another can be observed.
7338,世界银行对“可持续性”的关注（既在生态上又在金融上）收编了生态女权主义的观点，从而使妇女处于发展计划的最前沿。,"The World Bank's concern with ""sustainability"" (both ecological and financial) has led to a cooptation of ecofeminist arguments to place women in the forefront of development projects."
7338,同样，非中心化的绿色政治试图从高度中心化的全球环境管理科学中征用调查结果，甚至人员。,Decentralized green politics likewise seeks to coopt some of the findings if not some of the personnel from within a highly centralized science of global environmental management.
7339,在这次讲座的前面部分，我们讨论了大推进模型，这个例子已经证明反映超发展理论精髓的模型并不需要非常复杂。,The example of the Big Push model discussed earlier in this lecture shows that models in the spirit of high development theory need not be very complicated.
7339,但无论怎样它们必须处理市场结构的问题。,"They must, however, deal somehow with the problem of market structure."
7339,这实质上意味着我们需要做出一些特殊的假设，来利用产业组织理论家在20世纪70年代思考类似问题时开发出来的许多工具。,This essentially means making some peculiar assumptions that allow one to exploit the bag of tricks that industrial organization theorists developed for thinking about such issues in the 1970s.
7340,如果我们从条带左下方一次扰动(比如打击)开始，新情况的特征是有机体的重组和短期的外貌或向外扩展—先锋期（或生态学上的γ相）。,"If we start following a major perturbation (say a shock) at the bottom left of the strip, the new situation is characterized by reorganization and the transient appearance or expansion of organisms –the pioneer stage (or r-phase in ecology)."
7340,"进而走向相对稳定K相的稳固合并，其特征是平衡状态下的保守行为（见Obando,2002)。","This leads to steady consolidation leading towards the relatively stable k-phase, which is characterized by conservative behaviour at equilibrium (again, see Obando, 2002)."
7340,系统的联通性增加直至系统崩溃为止，这也许是某些微小变化导致超越内部阈限而造成的。,"The system’s connectedness increases until the system collapses, perhaps as a result of some small change leading to the crossing of an internal threshold."
7340,接着走向作者们称之为释放的阶段并最后走向重组，重新开始适应性循环。,"This, in turn, leads to what the authors call the release, and eventually to a reorganization that starts the adaptive cycle again."
7341,思维导图以形象的方式展示了研究人员的思考和反馈过程。,Mind maps display the thinking and reflections of researchers in a visual pattern.
7341,思维导图将思维联系起来并确定了数据间的关系。,Mind maps connect thoughts and identify relationships between data.
7341,思维导图也被称为语义网状图。,Mind maps may be referred to as semantic webs.
7341,语义网状图是由与相互联系的数据相关的术语所构成的，用以表示数据分析、关系或概念性思考的网状结构。,"Semantic webs are associated with terms relevant to the data that are linked together to form a web-like construction of data analysis, relationships or conceptual thinking."
7342,数据编码包括编码的形成、数据输入及数据整理。,"Coding data involves the development of codes, data entry and datacleaning."
7342,数据输入可使用转换表、页缘编码、直接数据输入、扫描仪、电子数据表以及人工记录单。,"Data entry can be undertaken using transfer sheets, edge-coding, direct data entry, scanners, spreadsheets and manual tally sheets."
7342,数据的整理是与编码式整理和逻辑整理相关联的。,Datacleaning is associated with code cleaning and contingency cleaning.
7343,如果调査问卷设计得能够直接进行数据输入，那么数据输入就能够被迅速处理。,Data entry can be expedited if the questionnaire is designed to enable direct data entry.
7343,在这种情况下，编码人员没有必要将数据输入到编码卡、转换表或者是编码表上——数据将直接从调査问卷答案纸上输入到指定的计算机程序中进入分析阶段。,"In this case, there is no need for coders to transfer data onto code cards, transfer sheets or code sheets — the data are entered directly from the questionnaire response sheet into the computer program assigned for the analysis phase."
7343,参考图9-2关于这方面的一个例子。正如读者所见，这些答案由调査者或调査助手预先编码，这样会使编码或输入变得更容易。,"Refer back to figure 9.2 for an example of this — as you can see, the responses are pre-coded to facilitate coding and entry by the researcher or research assistant."
7344,区域地理学最大的缺点就是把这些所谓的综合工作留给读者去完成。,The greatest limitation of regional geography was that the so-called integration was left to the reader to accomplish.
7344,因此要寻找描述地方动态或过程和反映地方运行方式的一些参数。,Hence parameters were sought which described the dynamics or process of place and which reflected the way in which place functioned.
7344,随着水文学的出现，用水沙传输的输出参数反映上游集水区综合特征的方式就是一个很好的例子。,"With the advent of hydrology, this was exemplified by the way in which output parameters of water and sediment delivery reflected the integrated characteristics of the catchment areas upstream."
7345,思维导图以形象的方式展示了研究人员的思考和反馈过程。,Mind maps display the thinking and reflections of researchers in a visual pattern.
7345,思维导图将思维联系起来并确定了数据间的关系。,Mind maps connect thoughts and identify relationships between data.
7345,思维导图也被称为语义网状图。,Mind maps may be referred to as semantic webs.
7345,语义网状图是由与相互联系的数据相关的术语所构成的，用以表示数据分析、关系或概念性思考的网状结构。,"Semantic webs are associated with terms relevant to the data that are linked together to form a web-like construction of data analysis, relationships or conceptual thinking."
7346,我们必须根据辩论或辩论者的情境或位置批判性地评价全部有关社会行动的主张(或者社会正义的观念)。,All propositions for social action (or conceptions of social justice) must be critically evaluated in terms of the situatedness or positionality of the argument and the arguer.
7346,但同样重要的是承认，发展这种情境化知识的个人本身并不是均质的实体，而是大量异质的冲动，有许多来源于自身之中“多重他性”的内在化。,"But it is equally important to recognize that the individuals developing such situated knowledge are not themselves homogeneous entities but bundles of heterogeneous impulses, many of which derive from an internalization of ""multiple othernesses"" within the self."
7346,这种主体观念使情境性(他们的位置)本身成为异质的和有差异的，高度依赖在相当不同的时空规模上运行的社会过程。,"Such a conception of the subject, renders situatedness (their place) itself heterogeneous and differentiated, highly dependent upon social processes operating at quite different spatio-temporal scales."
7346,最后，它是不同规模上的情境性(位置)的社会构造，而且在那种社会构造中，不管个人如何深地嵌在资本积累的宏观过程中，个人政治选择、承诺和忠诚还是极大地发挥作用。,"In the last instance, it is the social construction of situatedness (places) at different scales which matters and in that social construction the agency of personal political choice and commitment, of loyalties, brooks large, however embedded individuals may be in macro-processes of capital accumulation on the world stage."
7347,然而，少数群体向低层次职业结构的集中正是他们廉价住房地区化的最根本原因。,But it is the concentration of minority groups at the lower end of the occupational structure that is the more fundamental factor in their localization in poor housing.
7347,由于少数群体成员缺乏技能和受教育的资格，他们通常会集中在难以吸引特权群体成员的职业中，这类职业从某些方面来看常常是不舒适的，或者不体面的，并且工资很低。,"Because of their lack of skills and educational qualifications, members of minority groups often tend to be concentrated in occupations that are unattractive to members of the charter group, that are often unpleasant or degrading in one way or another, and that are usually associated with low wages."
7347,大多数这种类型的职业处于CBD及其周围地区，而少数群体对集中的就业机会的依赖性被认为是决定他们居住集群区位的主要因素。,"The majority of such occupations are associated with the CBD and its immediate surrounds, and the dependence of minority groups on city centre and inner-city job opportunities is widely cited as a prime determinant in the location of minority residential clusters."
7347,反过来，这一因素又由于围绕CBD的内城邻里的廉价住房区位而得到强化。,"This factor, in turn, is reinforced by the location of inexpensive accommodation in inner-city neighbourhoods surrounding the CBD."
7348,绝对不能回避普遍性，那些试图这样做(如许多后现代和后结构主义表述中的情况)的人最终只能是掩盖而不是消灭这一条件。,"The universality can never be avoided, and those who seek to do so (as is the case in many postmodern and poststructuralist formulations) only end up hiding rather than eliminating the condition."
7348,但是，普遍性必须以它与特殊性的辩证关系来解释。,But universality must be construed in dialectical relation with particularity.
7348,它们互相定义，从而使普遍性标准总是易于通过差异的特殊性进行协商。,Each defines the other in such a way as to make the universality criterion always open to negotiation through the particularities of difference.
7349,因此，这两种土地使用形式都会对人群的流通做出贡献。,"Both kinds of land thus contribute to,  circulation."
7349,但是，在它们之间总会存在着某些紧张的关系。,But there is always a certain tension in their relationship.
7349,在特殊用地形式的两个角色之间总是存在着一种通过相互牵制产生平衡的关系:一方面是土地的普通使用的促进者，另一方面是这种用途的干涉者。,"There is always a pull and a counterpull between the special land's two roles: as a contributor to the use of general land on the one hand, and an interference with its use on the other."
7350,有些交界处不允许两边的交叉使用。,Some borders halt cross-use from both sides.
7350,非封闭的铁轨或高速公路就是最好的例子。,Open railroad tracks or expressways or water barriers are common examples.
7350,有些交界处的使用率低，那是因为这个地方的单一用途的土地使用密度相对于其拥有的区域来说太低。,"Some borders have cross-use from both directions, but it is limited, in appreciable amounts, to daylight or it falls off drastically at cernin times of year."
7350,面积广阔的市政中心就是一个好例子。,Large parks are common examples.
7351,对我们物种潜能的探究当然也涉及创造性研究和探究多样性和异质性。,The exploration of our species potentiality can presumably also be about the creative search for and exploration of diversity and heterogeneity.
7351,那些与我们处理异化(和返魅)以及探寻自我实现多种可能性努力步调一致的，在根本上是社会主义未来的一部分。,"Socio-ecological projects, much more in tune with confronting questions of alienation (and re-enchantment) and opening up diverse possibilities for self-realization, can be regarded as fundamentally part of some socialist future."
7351,除了冷漠的、商品化的同质性的不平衡地理发展，资本主义不能生产更多的东西，这确实是它的最令人震惊的无能。,"The failures of capitalism to produce anything other than the uneven geographical development of bland, commoditized, homogeneity is, surely, one of the most striking features of its failures."
7352,关于无障碍空间的新思维牵涉到把世界重新描述为流与连续改革的困难任务。,New thinking about unblocking space involves the difficult task of redescribing the world as flow and continuous transformation.
7352,当图像传播包括大量中间体的时候，关于图像空间的新思维要重新思考图像是如何传播与保持稳定。,New thinking about image space involves reconsidering how images are circulated and kept stable when that circulation involves large numbers of intermediaries.
7352,关于地方空间的新思维要尝试理解日常生活韵律的间隙，通过这些间隙新的表演得以进行。,And new thinking about place space involves trying to understand the gaps in the rhythms of everyday life through which new performances are able to pass.
7353,正如我们将要看到的，这些不同的位置性在环境正义运动的内部围绕着阶级、种族、性别和民族身份等问题制造了解释的张力。,"Such different positionalities create, as we shall see, interpretive tensions within the environmental justice movement across the themes of class, race, gender, and national identity."
7353,例如，许多证据表明：即使对社会地位和阶级问题进行控制，有色人种也还是更容易遭受环境危险。布拉德(Bullard，1993:21)概括了这些证据并得出结论：不公正从根本上来说是一个种族问题而不是阶级问题。,"Bullard (1993: 21) summarizes evidence to show, for example, that people of color are much more vulnerable to environmental hazards even when controlling for social status and class and concludes that the injustice is fundamentally a race and not a class problem."
7354,因此，文化研究的一个重要主题是多样性和差异性。,"A key theme of cultural studies, then, is diversity and difference."
7354,在社会主流价值中还有许多具有自己鲜明文化的小支流，它们被称为亚文化（subculture)(如果这个标准偏离主流文化很远，有时也被命名为“非正常”亚文化（‘deviant’ subcultures)。,"There are, within the dominant values of a society, many smaller subgroups with their own distinctive cultures, known as subcultures (and sometimes termed ‘deviant’ subcultures if the norms are significantly at variance with the majority)."
7354,变种（atterity)这个术语有时被用来描述那些与它们所对立的文化完全不同的，并且在那些对立文化之外的文化。,The term alterity is sometimes used to denote a culture that is radically different from and totally outside that to which it is opposed.
7355,社会中的文化价值差异性产生了身份（identity)问题（即人们对自己的看法）。,The diversity of cultural values in society raises issues of identity (i.e.the view that people take of themselves).
7355,有一个可以追溯到哲学家笛卡尔的观点假设，人的身份是单一的、合理的和稳定的。,"There is a perspective, stretching back to the philosopher Descartes, that assumes that people’s identities are single, rational and stable."
7355,然而，这种假设遭到文化研究观点的反驳。,"However, this assumption is disputed by a cultural studies perspective."
7355,首先，它们认为我们的身份是多因素的，包括阶级、年龄、职业、社会性别、生理性别、国籍、宗教派别、出生地等等。,"To begin with, it is argued that our identities are shaped by many factors such as class, age, occupation, gender, sexuality, nationality, religious affiliation, region of origin and so on."
7355,围绕这些因素会有各种各样的关于性格和能力的话语，这些话语被称为主体地位（subject positions)，它影响我们的行为方式。,Surrounding these factors are various discourses about characteristics and abilities --- what are called subject positions --- that affect the way we behave.
7356,第四个佩恩广场已经缩成一个小小的交通岛，位于富兰克林大道上的洛根圆形广场，一个按照城市美化运动规划的样板。,"The forth of Penn's squares has been whittled to a small traffic island, Logan Circle, in Benjamin Franklin Boulevard, an example of City Beautiful planning."
7356,广场上矗立着一个巨大的喷泉，点缀着漂亮的植物。,The circle is adorned with a great soaring fountain and beautifully maintained planting.
7356,尽管要步行到那里面并不容易，而且对那些匆匆路过的人来说，这不过是高雅的装饰物而已，但在天气晴好的时候，此地还是能招引来三三两两的人。,"Although it is discouraging to reach on foot,and is mainly  an elegant amenity for those speeding by, it gets a trickle of population on fine days."
7356,紧邻这个纪念碑似的文化中心(cultural center )的地区曾衰败得不成样子，被当做贫民区拆迁，并被改建为如今这样的辐射性城区。,The district immediately adjoining the monumental cultural center  of which it is a part decayed terribly and has already been slum-cleared and converted to Radiant City.
7357,但是，由于种种原因，要了解所谓的文化转向却又困难重重。,"Understanding the so-called ‘cultural turn’ poses a number of difficulties, however, for a number of reasons."
7357,首先，大量解释新概念的新名词如同洪流一般多得几乎让人迷惑。而且，这些概念具有高度的相关性，构成了观察社会的新方法。,There has been a bewildering flood of new terms to describe a large set of new concepts that are all highly interrelated and build up to form radically new ways of looking at society.
7357,因此，如果单独拿出少数几个“文化”概念，很容易就忽视了这些概念的广泛意义。,Taking a few ‘cultural’ concepts in isolation therefore tends to neglect their wider significance.
7358,被此论题吸引的人们为了得到启发而去查阅(过去的和现在的)文献。,Those attracted to this cause explored the literature (past and present) for inspiration.
7358,"他们发现在空间组织的一般概念上,这就是人类活动在空间上有序的安排。","They found it in the general concept of spatial organization, the spatially ordered arrangement of human activities."
7358,"其中最令人鼓舞的是德国地理学家沃尔特‧克里斯坦勒(Walter Christaller, 1966) 的工作,他在1930年代初期为了理解聚落的模式发展了中心地理论。",
7359,就像案例研究一样，行动研究报告可以以科学实验报告的结构为模型（引言、 文献综述、方法、结果分析及未来研究计划），也可选择其他不同的模型。,"As with case studies, the report may be based on the scientific experimental model (introduction, literature review, method, findings and analysis, and future action plans), but there are alternative models."
7359,这些模型基于凯米斯和迈克塔哥特（1988）对行动研究的讨论。,These models are based on the discussion of action research by Kemmis and McTaggart (1988).
7359,另一种模型是按行动研究程序的时间顺序进行报道。,One alternative model involves the chronological reporting of the action research process.
7360,原始资料或二手资料的使用取决于研究项目本身、使用的范式和一些外部因素诸如时间金钱等的限制。,"The use of primary or secondary data depends on the research project, the overlying paradigm and any external factors such as time and monetary constraints."
7360,对于旅游研究者来说，资料来源是很广泛的，原始资料可以通过观察法、访谈法、专家小组或问卷调查法等方式收集。,"For tourism researchers, data sources are extensive.Primary data may be gathered by using observation, interviews, panel groups or questionnaires."
7360,二手资料可以通过由私人、公共和非营利部门提供的文化文件和文物来收集。,"Secondary data may be gathered from cultural documents and artefacts accessible in the private, public and non-profit sectors."
7361,为了决定每个层次的起始呼叫号码，我们可以使用抽签、随机数表或电脑产生的办法。,"To determine our starting number in each prefix or strata, we can use the lottery system, a table of random numbers or computer generation."
7361,接着我们需要决定我们的抽样间隔（参见上文的系统抽样）。,Then we need to determine our sampling fraction (see systematic sampling above).
7361,一旦抽样间隔和起始号码确定了，每个随后的号码的选取都依据前一个号码和抽样间隔得到。,"Once the sampling fraction and starting number have been determined, each subsequent number that is selected is based on the corresponding previous number as a result of using the sampling fraction."
7362,"维尔（1992, p. 114)认为现场调查是在旅游研究中最常使用的调査方法。它既可以由受访者完成，也可以由调査者完成。","Veal (1992, p. 114) suggests that on-site surveys are the most used form of survey in tourism.On-site surveys may be either self-completed orinterviewer-completed."
7362,其优缺点是以上讨论的自填式问卷调査和调査者完成问卷调査优劣的映照。,The advantages and disadvantages of on-site surveysreflect the advantages and disadvantages discussed above for selfcompletion questionnaires and interviewer-completed questionnaires.
7363,但是在这两例中，地理学与文学研究——有时似乎在“真实性”与“想象”之间求得平衡——在很大程度上停留在彼此分离上。,"But in both these examples, geography and literary studies – sometimes seeming to parallel ‘reality’ and ‘imagination’ – remained largely separate from each other."
7363,虽然文学(尤其是小说)为地理分析提供了新的来源，但是分析本身常常仍然是社会科学的，未把注意力放在文学理论与文学批评上。,"While literature (particularly novels) provided a new source for geographical analysis, the analysis itself often remained social scientific and paid little attention to literary theory and criticism."
7363,地理学家不去研究文学的形式、惯例和语言，而是经常认为“文学就是感知”。,"Rather than study literary forms, conventions and language, humanistic geographers often regarded ‘literature simply [as] perception’ ."
7364,其次，每一种语言游戏都与说话者特殊的社会的、交流的、经验的和感性的世界相关联。,"Secondly, each language game attaches to the particular social, communicative, experiential, and perceptual world of the speaker."
7364,结果使我们理解了有关文化、语言或话语的相对主义，尽管这种理解是基于主体的物质环境的。,"The upshot is to bring us to a point of cultural, linguistic or discourse relativism, albeit based upon the material circumstances of the subject."
7364,因此，我们也应该仔细地关注这些物质环境。,"We should also, then, pay careful attention to those material circumstances."
7365,社会是普遍性的，同时它也具体而有活力。,"Society is the universal which, at the same time, is concretely alive."
7365,由之产生了独特的意义，交换即是作为事物相对性的经济—历史的实现，是为社会而进行的，交换以其独特性为个体造就了特殊的对象及其意义，它的独特性并不在于抽象领域，而在于生动的相互作用领域，这就是经济价值的实质。,"From this arises the unique significance that exchange, as an economic-historical realization of the relativity of things, has for society; exchange raises the specific object and its significance for the individual above its singularity, not into the sphere of abstraction, but into that of lively interaction which is the substance of economic value."
7365,(Simmel，1978:101),(p. 101)
7366,相关性测量将二元关系的信息用一个单独数字表示。,Measures of association reduce informadon about a bivariate reladonship into a single numerical representation.
7366,相关性测量是指通过统计计算来判断两个变量之间是否存在关系。,Measures of association indicate whether there is or is not a relationship between the variables through the use of statistical calculations.
7366,存在许多此类量数，例如，λ，γ，Τ， ρ以及卡方。,"There are a number of measures such as lambda, gamma, tau, rho and chi-square."
7366,表9-5对每个量数都进行了概述。,An overview of each is presented in table 9.5.
7367,老实告诉你，我们雇用伯伦不为别的，就是因为他有影响。我们要等上几个月才能见到那些局长们——比如，卫生、消防((fire department))和警察部门——但是他要做的只是拿起电话，立马我们这边就会见效。”,"""It would be fantastic to tell you we hired Baron for any other reason than his influence. We would wait months for meetings with Commissioners---like the Health, Fire, and Police Departments----but then he would go to the phone and immediately, we would have action."""
7368,如第六章提到的，历时研究可以分为小样本多次调查、时间序列研究、趋势研究、世代分析以及案例研究。,"As noted in chapter 6, longitudinal studies can be described as panelstudies, time series studies, trend studies and cohort analysis studies, as wellas case studies."
7368,历时研究方法也可以选用几种方法混合而成。,Longitudinal studies may also constitute a mix of thesetypes.
7368,每种方法都由定量方法论指导（或一种定性方法论，参见第六章）。,"Each type can be informed by a quantitative methodology (or aqualitative methodology, see chapter 6)."
7369,审稿人、编辑或大会主席的评论会帮助你改进文章的内容；这是写作的一部分，这也将有助于文章的修改。,The comments of the reviewers and the editors/chairs are there to help you to improve your text; they are part of the writing process and assistyou in your revision of your text.
7369,他们的评论将确保你的文章所表达的意思对预期读者来说是清晰的。,Their comments are provided to ensure that your meaning is clear for the intended audience.
7369,如果你对评论有异议，可以与编辑或主席进行讨论。,"If you disagree with some points from reviewers or editors/chairs, then discuss them with the editor or chair."
7369,再次呈交文章时，要准备一份封面信，表明所做的修改并说明未做修改之处的原因。,"When you resubmit your text, indicate in a covering letter which changes have been made and, if some were not made, the reasons why this is the case."
7370,和贫民区清空指示图一样，信贷封杀标示图的预言非常准确，因为他们(信贷者)用自己的实际行动去实践了这些预言。,"Credit-blacklisting maps, like slum-clearance maps, are accurate prophecies because they are self-fulfilling prophecies."
7370,而在北端和“后院”这些地方，这些图标示的预言却并不能得到验证。但是如果没有这些地区本身拥有的奇迹般的逃避 “死刑”的能力，那谁又会预料到那些预言会得不到验证？,"In the cases of the North End and the Back-of-the-Yards, the blacklist maps were inaccurate prophecies.But no one would ever know they had been inaccurate estimates of the potentiality, were it for the miraculous ability of these places to  evade their sentences."
7371,搜索空间内寻找空置住房时利用的信息来源可能同样具有显著的空间偏向性。,The information sources used to find vacant dwellings within the search space can also exert a significant spatial bias.
7371,同时，因为不同类塑的家庭倾向于依赖不同信息来源的次序和组合，这可能导致进一步的社会空间排列过程。,"Since different types of households tend to rely on different sequences and combinations of sources, this results in a further process of sociospatial sorting."
7371,总体而言，最常使用的空房信息来源是报纸广告、房地产代理商、亲戚朋友和对“出售”标记的个人观察，尽管其相对重要程度和有效程度可因城市而不同。虽然对这些信息来源的研究还很少，但十分明显的是，每种信息来源都存在不同方式的偏向。例如，个人观察在很大程度上取决于个人的活动空间，而从亲朋好友处获得的信息的数量和质量则在很大程度上有赖于找房者的社会地位和社会网络结构。,"Overall, the most frequently used sources of information about housing vacancies are newspaper advertisements, real estate agents, friends and relatives, and personal observation of ‘for sale’signs --- although their relative importance and effectiveness seems to vary somewhat from one city to another. Each of these information sources tends to be biased in a different way. Personal observation, for example, will be closely determined by people’s personal activity space, while the quantity and quality of information from friends and relatives will depend a lot on social class and the structure of the searcher’s social networks."
7371,房地产代理商作为信息中介同样具有严重的空间偏向。,Real estate agents also exert a considerable spatial bias in their role as mediators of information.
7372,然而，如史密斯（1992: 72）所评论的那样，“地理规模生产理论”(我将补充一点，时间的生产亦是如此)“在总体上是不发达的”。,"Yet, as Smith (1992: 72) remarks, ""the theory of the production of geo-graphical scale"" (to which I would add also the production of temporalities) – ""is grossly underdeveloped."""
7372,这似乎意味着，一种嵌套的规模等级(从全球到地方)的生产总是使我们陷入一种如何“在它们之间进行仲裁和翻译”的政治态学问题之中。,"It seems to imply the production of a nested hierarchy of scales (from global to local) leaving us always with the political–ecological question of how to ""arbitrate and translate between them."""
7372,生态辩论正是在这一点上令人难以置信地混乱。,The ecological argument is incredibly confused on exactly this point.
7372,一方面，盖亚星球健康关怀行动的专家们在全球层次上思考和行动，而生态区域主义者和社会无政府主义者则在地方层次上思考和行动，他们相当错误地假设，无论什么对于地方有益的东西对于大陆或全球也都是有好处的。,"On the one hand the Gaian planetary health care specialists think globally and seek to act globally, while the bioregionalists and social anarchists want to think and act locally, presuming, quite erroneously, that whatever is good for the locality is good for the continent or the planet."
7373,在《单子论》这本接近其生命终点的著作中，莱布尼茨提出一种建立在单子概念上的形而上学，单子把存在的一切都内在化了。,"In the Monadology, written towards the very end of his life, Leibniz proposes a metaphysics founded on the concept of a monad that internalizes everything there is."
7373,每一个单子都反映宇宙：“对应”法则内在地把每一单子指派成宇宙的镜子。,"Each monad mirrors the universe: a principle of ""correspondence"" internally constitutes each monad as that mirror of the universe."
7373,莱布尼茨在两个方面限定这种对应法则。,Leibniz restricts this correspondence principle in two respects.
7374,网格水平轴向上的四个维度必须被看做是相互依存的。,The four dimensions across the horizontal axis of the grid have to be seen as mutually interdependent.
7374,可达性和延展化是一个硬币的两面：距离摩擦在人类事物中所扮演的角色。,Accessibility and distanciation are two sides of the same coin: the role of the friction of distance in human affairs.
7374,距离，正如我们在第八章所见，既是社会相互作用的障碍，又是它的保护伞。,"Distance, as we saw in Chapter 8, is both a barrier to and a defence against social interaction."
7374,时空延展“只是为适应社会相互作用而超越空间摩擦的程度的一种 度量而已”。,Distanciation‘is simply a measure of the degree to which the friction of space has been overcome to accommodate social interaction’.
7374,空间的占用指的是个人、社会团体、活动（如土地利用）和物体（房屋、工厂、街道）对空间的占据方式。,"The appropriation of space refers to the way in which space is occupied by individuals, social groups, activities (e.g.land uses) and objects (houses, factories, streets)."
7374,空间的统治指空间和地方组织的生产能够被权力个人或团体所控制的方式，包括通过私人财产法、规划条例、限制条约、门限（包括暗指的门限）等方法实现。,"The domination of space refers to the way in which the organization and production of spaces and places can be controlled by powerful individuals or groups: through private property laws, zoning ordinances, restrictive covenants, gates (and implied gates), etc."
7374,空间的生产指地域组织、土地利用、交通与通讯等（实际的或想像的)新系统的出现方式，以及其新表达方式。,"The production of space refers to the way in which new systems of territorial organization, land use, transport and communications, etc. (actual or imagined) arise, along with new ways of representing them."
7375,研究报告拥有许多目标读者。,There are a number of audiences for research reports.
7375,Ticehurst和Veal （1999）将读者分成3类：普通公众、决策者及专业人家（专家）。,"Ticehurst and Veal (1999) identify three: the general public, decision makers and professionals (experts)."
7375,纽曼（2000)将读者分为5类：指导者、学生、学者、从业者及普通公众。,"Neuman (2000) identifies five: instructors, students, scholars, practitioners and the general public."
7375,无论怎样分类，在撰写研究报告时都需要事先识别目标读者，因为读者将决定报告的语气、要旨及具体的写作类型（风格或写作形式）。,"Regardless of how you classify audiences, in reporting your research you need to be cognisant of your audience, as this will influence the tone and tenor of your writing, as well as the specific genre (type or form of writing) that will be selected."
7376,第一章中已经介绍了研究方法在本质上的两分法：定量研究方法与定性研究方法。,In chapter 1 you were introduced to an essentially binary classification of research methodologies: qualitative and quantitative methodologies.
7376,其中也提到了第三种方法:混合研究方法。,A third type was also suggested: the mixed method approach.
7376,到目前为止，你应该明白定量与定性方法是定位在世界观（即本体论观点）连续统一体的对立两极。,"By now, you should be aware that qualitative and quantitative methodologies are located at opposite ends of a continuum regarding world views, that is ontological positions."
7377,研究计划通常包括7个部分：引言、文献综述、方法论、工作进度、经费预算、参考文献及每位研究者的履历。,"A research proposal consists of seven sections: an introduction, a literature review, a methodology section, a time line, a budget, a reference section and the attached curriculum vitae or résumé for each researcher."
7377,研究计划的篇幅一般在1000~2000字之间。,Research proposals are generally between 1000 and 2000 words in length.
7377,有时研究者在制订研究计划时必须采用由委托方、客户或相关利益集团提供的统一格式的申请书。,"Sometimes, proformas are provided by granting agencies, clients or stakeholder bodies for use by researchers in the preparation of research proposals."
7377,不同受众对研究计划的编写有不同的要求。,"Depending on the audience, different requirements will be imposed on the writing of the research proposal."
7378,如上所述，所有的研究都应该以一种符合伦理的方式来实施。,"As already stated, all research must be undertaken in an ethical manner."
7378,这在应用性研究中尤为重要，因为委托人或发起人在研究设计和报告中可能存在一种偏见。,"This is especially relevant in undertaking applied research, as the client or sponsor may angle for a bias in the research design or reporting."
7378,研究者受到伦理标准的约束，因此这种偏见是不能接受的。,Researchers are bound by ethical standards and such angling is not acceptable.
7378,研究者必须对自己、学术界、公众和发起人承担相应的伦理责任。,"Researchers must be responsible to themselves, the scientific community, the public and the sponsors for the conduct of ethical research."
7379,研究者能够获得两种类型的资料：原始资料和二手资料。,Researchers are able to access two types of data sources: primary and secondary.
7379,原始资料是指那些为了他们研究项目的使用目的而由研究者第一手收集的资料。,Primary data sources are those that are collected first-hand by the researcher for use in their research project.
7379,原始资料包括诸如问卷调査数据、访谈文本和观察数据。,"Primary data include, for example, responses to questionnaires, interview texts and observations."
7379,二手资料是指那些因其他人的初始使用目的而产生但后来被与初始项目不相关的另外的研究者使用的资料。,Secondary data sources are those that have been produced by someone else for primary usage and are then used by another researcher not connected with the first project.
7379,二手资料包括诸如统计记录、政府文件、日记、信件以及其他研究者取得的研究成果数据。,"Secondary data include, for example, statistical records, government documents, diaries and letters, and research data conducted by other researchers."
7380,使用字母作为样本单位选取的组织者，就像简单随机抽签方法一样，样本单位由字母顺序决定。,"Using the alphabet as the organiser for the selection of the sample units, as well as the simple random lottery method, the alphabetical letter is determined for sample selection."
7380,和字母相关的参与者或研究单元成为次级抽样框。,Participants or study units associated with that letter become the second sampling frame.
7380,每个样本单位是用抽签方法、随机数表（参见附录6)或电脑产生名单的方式从次级抽样框中选取的。,"From this second sampling frame, individual sample units are selected using either the lottery method, a table of random numbers (see appendix 6) or computer-generated listings."
7380,也可能重复使用字母顺序抽样法获得研究样本。,There may be several iterations of the selection of alphabetical letters.
7381,最后，我们考虑要素流动性。,"Finally, we turn to factor mobility."
7381,假定农民是完全不流动的。,Farmers are assumed completely immobile.
7381,工人向提供更高工资的地区流动。,Workers are assumed to move toward locations that offer them higher real wages.
7381,（此处我们没有尝试明确地模型化工人的流动决策。,(No attempt is made here to model the moving decision explicitly.)
7381,）我们将在下一个部分看到，对于任意时点可以求解模型得到每一个地区工人的实际工资。,"As we will see in the next section, it is possible to solve the model at any point in time for the real wages paid to workers at each location."
7382,数据编码包括编码的形成、数据输入及数据整理。,"Coding data involves the development of codes, data entry and data cleaning."
7382,数据输入可使用转换表、页缘编码、直接数据输入、扫描仪、电子数据表以及人工记录单。,"Data entry can be undertaken using transfer sheets, edge-coding, direct data entry, scanners, spreadsheets and manual tally sheets."
7382,数据的整理是与编码式整理和逻辑整理相关联的。,Data cleaning is associated with code cleaning and contingency cleaning.
7383,尽管如此，但考克斯的方法确实让我们思考，不同的社会行动主体是如何依赖于特定的空间而又谋求与其他运作于和他们自己迥异的依赖空间中的社会行动主体联合的。,"Nevertheless, Cox’s approach does allow us to think about how different social actors may be dependent upon particular spaces yet may seek to engage with other social actors operating within their own, quite different, spaces of dependence."
7383,通过这种途径，尺度的产生以一些不恰当的方式被概念化，其中社会行动主体建立起一些啮合空间，用以连接那些相互依赖的空间，或者它们必须与之打交道的空间。因此，对于考克斯来说，从本土性到全球性尺度的转变“不是从一个平台跳到另一个平台的运动”，而是一种形成共生体网络的过程，这种网络容许社会行动主体在不同的啮合空间进行切换。,"For Cox, then, the production of scale is conceptualized as emerging out of the ways in which actors build spaces of engagement to link the various spaces upon which they, or those with whom they must deal, are dependent, such that moving from  the local to the global scale ‘is not a movement from one discrete arena to another’, but a process of developing networks of associations that allow actors to shift between various spaces of engagement."
7384,多变量分析是指同时对两个以上变量的分析。,Multivariate analysis involves the analysis of more than two variables at the one time.
7384,研究者保持一个变量为常量 (作为控制变量），然后，检验一个自变量和一个因变量的关系。,The researcher holds one variable constant (as a control) and examines an independent and a dependent variable.
7384,研究者可通过检验来判断自变量和因变量的关系对于另一变量的不同种类是否一致。,The researcher tests to see if the association between the independent and dependent variable is the same for different categories in a variable.
7385,显然，保护人类和非人类参与者的权利是研究者的首要责任。,"Obviously, the protection of human and non-human rights is the researcher's primary responsibility."
7385,研究不应该给参与者带来任何身体上、法律上或其他的伤害。,"Research should not cause physical, psychological, legal or other harm."
7385,参与者的参与应该建立在自愿和知情同意的基础上。,Research participation should be voluntary and based on informed consent.
7385,匿名和保密原则应该严格遵守。,Anonymity and confidentiality assurances must be honoured.
7385,欺骗和隐性研究从本质上说是不道德的，同时也需要经过专家组织的认可。,Deception and covert research are essentially unethical and require sanctioning by an auspicating body or ethics panel.
7386,正如纯理论研究可以采用探索性的、描述性的和解释性的研究方法一样，应用性研究也可采用这样一些研究方法。,"Just as pure research draws on several approaches, that is exploratory, descriptive and explanatory research, so too does applied research."
7386,但是，应用性研究涉及了更多的研究方法：探索性的、描述性的、解释性的、因果关系的、比较性的、评价性的、预测性的 (所有这些方法都将在下面予以解释）。但这些方法并不是互相排斥的。,"However, applied research draws on a wider range of approaches: exploratory, descriptive, explanatory, causal, comparative, evaluative and predictive (all of these terms are explained below).This does not mean to imply that each of these approaches is mutually exclusive."
7386,应用性研究既可以是描述性的，也可以是解释性的。,Research may be both descriptive and explanatory.
7387,在对社会越轨行为进行研究的各种理论中，这种做法甚为普遍，但在对违法犯罪行为的研究中可能最具说服力。,"This is common to all branches of social deviance research, although it is probably best illustrated in relation to crime and delinquency."
7387,关于违法犯罪行为的空间变量的大量研究都支持拥挤理论、社会无序化、社会反常状态及设计决定论等理论。但还没有系统而有效的证据显示其中某个理论居于主导地位。,"Empirical studies of spatial variations in crime and delinquency have lent support, variously, to theories of crowding, social disorganization, anomie, design determinism and deviant subcultures; but it is difficult to assemble evidence in support of any one theory in preference to the rest."
7388,有害垃圾运动正在这个方向上形成清晰的姿态。,The hazardous wastes movement is making explicit gestures in this direction.
7388,它逐渐从更大的社会批判角度来阐述自己的环境使命;它与其他运动的联合起来，并且宣布，最终，它们全都要 加入同一个斗争中。,"It increasingly defines its environmental mission in terms of a larger critique of society; it makes common came with other movements and says that, ultimately, they are all joined in the same struggle."
7388,它甚至设想了这样的未来:草根环境主义率先重构一种广泛的社会正义运动。,It even envisions a future in which grass-roots environmentalism spearheads the reconstitution of a broad social justice movement.
7389,其一，与莱布尼茨不一样，怀特海承认时间可以与空间不同。,"1. Whitehead, unlike Leibniz, allows that time can be differentiated from space."
7389,在他的早期著作中，他认为这种差别仅发生于“抽象过程的某个高级阶段”。,"In his earlier writings he saw this differentiation only occurring ""at a somewhat developed stage of the abstractive process"" (Whitehead, 1920: 37)."
7389,但是在有机论哲学的发展中，他最终把差异视为一种产物，产生于把各种成分整合成持续存在的有机形式的整个过程。,But in developing his philosophy of organism he later came to see the differentiation as a product of the whole process of puffing together assemblages into organic forms that persisted over duration.
7390,各种与旅游相关的学科和分支学科都试图采用实验法和准实验法了解旅行和旅游现象。,Various disciplines and sub-disciplines associated with tourism use experimental and quasi-experimental methods to understand travel and tourism phenomena.
7390,下文考察了实验法和准实验法在预测和影响评估方面的应用。,"The following section looks at forecasting and impact assessment, both of which use experimental or quasi-experimental methods."
7390,在预测部分，举例说明了统计和数学模型在旅游经济效应研究中的应用。,"In the forecasting section, examples of statistical and mathematical models are noted with regard to economic aspects of tourism."
7390,类似的，有关社会和环境影响方面的研究也可采用实验法和准实验法。,Social and environmental impacts can similarly be studied using experimental and quasiexperimental methods.
7391,域分析是一个不间断的过程——在研究人员收集新数据的同时，他们必须确保分析适用于所有相关的被研究环境。,"Domain analysis is an ongoing process — as the researcher collects new data, they have to ensure that the analysis fits all contexts of the setting being studied."
7391,域可以被看作使用了分类学的方法。,Domains can also be described using taxonomies.
7391,本章将稍后介绍分类法。,Taxonomies are described later in the chapter.
7392,文艺复兴时代全球地图绘制活动严格地说就是在西方支配下的这样一种实践。,Renaissance mapping of the globe was exactly such an exercise in western domination.
7392,“帝国的注视”根据自己的需要、要求和欲望绘制世界，强制推行一张世界地图，从而抑制了差异。,"The ""imperial gaze"" mapped the world according to its own needs, wants and desires, imposing a map of the world in such a way as to suppress difference."
7392,如苏哈特论证的那样，结果“剥夺了属下获得知识和身份的权力”（Shohat，1991)。,"As Shohat (1991) argues, the effect was to disposess ""the subaltern of authority over knowledge and identity."""
7393,当你准备一份会议论文摘要时，要确保提供给评论者详细的叙述而不是简单地说明意图。第十章关于摘要写作的规则也适用于会议论文发言的准备。,"When preparing an abstract for consideration as a conference paper, youneed to ensure that you provide the reviewers with details, not intentions.The 'rules' for abstract writing noted in chapter 10 also hold true for conference presentations."
7393,例如：图11-1上的两份摘要，摘要一为评论者提供了研究的事实资料，而摘要二仅仅提供了描述性的陈述和研究意图。,"Consider, for example, the two abstracts shown infigure 11.1. Abstract 1 provides the reviewer with data about the research,whereas abstract 2 provides one statement that is informative and then discusses intentions."
7393,这样，评论者不太可能倾向于摘要二，因为它没有充分证明研究者工作的有效性。换言之，虽然摘要讲究简洁精练，但也要提供足够的细节。,"A reviewer would be less inclined to accept abstract 2since there is not enough evidence of the researcher's work available.Although abstracts are short, they must provide details."
7394,因此，在城市化过程中，似乎没有任何一个地方能够发动为系统转型提供动力的战斗特殊主义。,There seems then to be no place within the urbanization process from which to launch any kind of militant particularism capable of grounding the drive for systemic transformations.
7394,特别是最近20年来，“全球化”辞令已经变得特别重要，甚至在激进思想中代替了更具政治性的帝国主义、殖民主义和新殖民主义等概念。,"In the last 20 years in particular, the rhetoric of ""globalization"" has become particularly important, even replacing within segments of radical thought the more politicized concepts of imperialism, colonialism, and neo-colonialism."
7394,这种话语转向的意识形态结果特别地剥夺了各种形式的地方、城市甚至国家的政治行动的能力。,"The ideological effect of this discursive shift has been extraordinarily disempowering with respect to all forms of local, urban, and even national political action."
7395,但是，她认为这种折衷主义在两方面是不合理的。,"But, she argues, such eclecticism is unjustifiable, on two grounds."
7395,第一，马克思主义的抽象范畴不能等同于经验概念；它们的理论含义和语义含义 不一定相同。,"First, Marxian abstract categories cannot be equated with empirical concepts; their theoretical and vernacular meanings are not necessarily synonymous."
7395,第二，马克思主义工作具有某种明显的政治目的，而 运用马克思主义术语意味着接受这种目的。,"Secondly, Marxist work has an explicit political purpose, and use of Marxian terms implies an acceptance of that purpose."
7396,内部关系问题带来的难题是解释特殊真理如何可能。,The difficulty which arises in respect to internal relations is to explain how any particular truth is possible.
7396,只要存在着内部关系，万物都必定依赖他物。,"Insofar as there are internal relations, everything must depend upon everything else."
7396,但是如果事实如此，那么我们就不能认识任何事物，除非我们同样地知道其他的事物。,"But if this be the case, we cannot know about anything until we equally know everything else."
7396,因此，显而易见，我们必然需要了解一切。,"Apparently, therefore, we are under the necessity of saying everything at once."
7397,大众文化中的一个很好的模拟物的例子是布鲁斯•斯普林斯廷的音乐。,A good example of simulcra in popular culture is the music of Bruce Springsteen.
7397,他的音乐反映了美国蓝领男性的诉求，关注体力劳动、去工业化的城市环境、高速公路上飞驰的摩托车，当然还包括对异性的渴望。,"This music is marketed as the ‘authentic’ voice of the blue-collar American male with references to manual work, deindustrialized urban environments, riding motorcycles of freeways and, of course, an all-consuming desire for the opposite sex."
7397,全球的唱片销售记录创造了一个美国城市男性的神话。,Sales of his records across the globe have thus created an American urban male mythology.
7397,这种音乐由于缺乏“真实性”已经遭到了批评，而且正是通过这样的神话和传说人们过着自己的生活。,This music has been criticized for its lack of ‘authenticity’ and yet such myths and legends can influence the ways people live their lives.
7398,萨兰塔克斯（1998)在表9-7中涉及了非参数检验和参数检验。,Sarantakos (1998) refers to non-parametric and parametric tests in table 9.
7398,参数检验假定所研究的变量在总体中表现为正态分布。,7. Parametric tests assume that the variable being studied reflects a normal distribution in the population.
7398,非参数检验假定所研究的变量在总体中并不表现为正态分布。,Non-parametric tests assume that the variable being studied does not reflect a normal distribution in the population.
7399,有害垃圾运动正在这个方向上形成清晰的姿态。,The hazardous wastes movement is making explicit gestures in this direction.
7399,它越来越从更大的社会批判角度来阐述自己的环境使命；它与其他运动的联合起来，并且宣布，最终，它们全都要加入同一个斗争中。,"It increasingly defines its environmental mission in terms of a larger critique of society; it makes common came with other movements and says that, ultimately, they are all joined in the same struggle."
7399,它甚至设想了这样的未来：草根环境主义率先重构一种广泛的社会正义运动。,It even envisions a future in which grass-roots environmentalism spearheads the reconstitution of a broad social justice movement.
7400,这种理想主义政治论点的问题在于，它不能理解地方和文化是如何建构、维持和瓦解的。,"The problem with this idealist political argument, is that it fails to understand how places and cultures are constructed, sustained, and dissolved."
7400,过程和文化实体如何在地方中相互作用，这个根本性的辩证问题被回避了。,The fundamental dialectical question of how processes and cultural entities relate in place is averted.
7400,保护所谓人类文化成就制高点的文化“永恒性”，这种政治斗争发生在历史紧要关头也许是可以理解的，此时，流和过程通过时空压缩迅速转向，威胁所有已经形成的地方特性。,"The political struggle to protect supposed cultural ""permanences"" as highpoints of human cultural achievement may be understandable at a historical conjuncture when flows and processes are rapidly shifting through time-space compression, threatening the achieved qualities of all places."
7401,地方政治、草根政治、地方身份和民族政治、地区和城市政治，长久地伴随着我们。,"The politics of place and of turf, of local identity and nation, of regions and cities, has long been with us."
7401,它在资本主义不平衡地理发展之中也具有极大的重要性。,It has also been of great importance within the uneven geographical development of capitalism.
7401,在文化大众的修辞中，以及通过这种修辞进而在政治学修辞中，重新发现作为话语对象的地方，此时重要的是它的意义而不是这样的事实，即世界已经以某种方式发生变化，从而使地方的政治经济学或者文化政治学在当前比过去更为重要。,"The rediscovery of place as an object of discourse within the rhetoric of the cultural mass and, through that, within the rhetoric of politics is what is here significant rather than the fact that the world has changed in some way to make the political economy or cultural politics of place more important now than in the past."
7402,个人和社会群体之间的功能关系被看做是符号，并且，当这种关系被认定处于某特定的地理区域中时，人类生态学家就可以划分出社会区，或叫自然区域（natural areas):即“由于未受规划的生态和社会过程而导致的具备某种突出的自然、经济和文化特征的地域单元”。,"Functional relationships between different individuals and social groups were seen as symbiotic and, where such relationships could be identified as being focused within a particular geographical area, the human ecologists identified communities, or natural areas: ‘territorial units whose distinctive characteristics – physical, economic and cultural – are the result of the unplanned operation of ecological and social processes’ ."
7402,随着时间的变化，不同群体的竞争力和不同区位的相对吸引力都会发生变化，因此，这些地域也处于变化之中。,"As the competitive power of different groups altered and the relative attractiveness of different locations changed in the course of time, these territories were seen to shift."
7402,再次，生态学的概念被用来描述这种过程，引用了植物群落研究中的侵入（invasion) 、支配和演替（succession) 的概念。,"Once more, ecological concepts were invoked to describe the process, this time using the ideas of invasion, dominance and succession derived from the study of plant communities."
7403,接着考虑经济是如何发展演化的。,Next consider how the economy evolves.
7403,制造业会向更理想的地点转移，离开不太理想的地点，不过，在这个过程中，会改变市场潜力状况，通常会加强那些原来就受到青睐的区位的优势。,"Manufacturing will move toward more desirable sites and away from less desirable ones, but in so doing it will change the market potential map, typically reinforcing the advantage of already-favored locations."
7403,因此市场潜力也成为积累循环因果关系故事中的一个组成部分。,Thus market potential becomes part of a story of circular and cumulative causation.
7404,专家提出了有关来自麦凯、沙里纳、圣劳伦斯、马尔堡、耶蓬、罗克汉普顿和格拉德斯通的休闲者对肖尔沃特湾的使用情况的建议，抽样框根据专家建议按比例分层。,"The sampling frame was proportionately stratified based on experts' opinions regarding usage of the Shoalwater Bay area by recreationalists from Mackay, Sarina, St Lawrence, Marlborough, Yeppoon, Rockhampton and Gladstone."
7404,确定了每一地区的调查比例之后，各地依城区进一步按比例分层。,"After the proportions were determined for each of the locations, each location was further proportionally stratified by suburbs."
7404,"样本总体容量最终确定为1200,样本中50% 的置信区间为±3% ,置信度为95% (Veal 1992, p. 155)","The overall sample size was set at 1200 as this would provide a 95% confidence interval for a finding of 50% of +3.0% (Veal 1992, p. 155)."
7405,原先在城市里的人不是中产阶级，只有等到他们离幵城市——在城外购置上一个大房子，在屋外草地上可以做烧烤——由此变得显贵来，似乎只有这样，他们才可以称得上是中产阶级。,"City officials today prate about ""bringing back the middle cIass,"" as if nobody were in the middle class until he had left the city and acquired a ranch house and a barbecue and thereby become precious.To be sure, cities are losing their middle class populations."
7405,城市根本不需要去请什么“中产阶级回来”，而且还要像保护贵重物品一样严加保护。城市原本就会产生中产阶级。,"However, cities need not ""bring back"" a middle class, and carefully protect it like an artificial growth."
7406,正如我们将要看到的，这些不同的位置性在环境正义运动的内部围绕着阶级、种族、性别和民族身份等问题制造了解释的张力。,"Such different positionalities create, as we shall see, interpretive tensions within the environmental justice movement across the themes of class, race, gender, and national identity."
7406,例如，许多证据表明：即使对社会地位和阶级问题进行控制，有色人种也还是更容易遭受环境危险。布拉德(1993:21)概括了这些证据并得出结论：不公正从根本上来说是一个种族问题而不是阶级问题。,"Bullard (1993: 21) summarizes evidence to show, for example, that people of color are much more vulnerable to environmental hazards even when controlling for social status and class and concludes that the injustice is fundamentally a race and not a class problem."
7407,在利用电动机械流速仪测量一个方向（主流方向）时间平均流速的地方，以高频率进行测量的现代仪器还测量两个或三个正交的方向。,"Where the electro-mechanical current meter measured a time-averaged velocity in one direction (the main flow direction), the modern instruments that measure at high frequencies also measure in two or three orthogonal directions."
7407,这就意味着需关注速度的垂直和横流分量以及二次循环的问题。,"This means that attention can be given to the vertical and cross-stream components of velocity, and to questions of secondary circulation."
7407,也意味着不会因为其他两个方向的流速被合并为单个速度组分而损失测量的精密度和准确度。,It also means that the accuracy and precision of the measurements is not contaminated by folding into a single velocity component the velocities in the other two orthogonal directions.
7408,下文考察了实验法和准实验法在预测和影响评估方面的应用。,"The following section looks at forecasting and impact assessment, both of which use experimental or quasi-experimental methods."
7408,在预测部分，举例说明了统计和数学模型在旅游经济效应研究中的应用。,"In the forecasting section, examples of statistical and mathematical models are noted with regard to economic aspects of tourism."
7408,类似的，有关社会和环境影响方面的研究也可采用实验法和准实验法。,Social and environmental impacts can similarly be studied using experimental and quasiexperimental methods.
7409,这样的关系能用二元表格来求出——也就是说，二元表格能够使调查者采用交叉列表来表示两个变量。,"Such relationships can be determined using bivariate tables — that is, bivariate tables enable the researcher to crosstabulate two variables."
7409,任何测量层次的变量(定类、定序、定距和定比)都可以构造二元表格。,"Bivariate tables can be constructed with variables measured at any level (nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio)."
7409,在制作二元表格时，自变量出现在列，因变量出现在行。,"When preparing bivariate tables, the independent variable is presented in the columns and tire dependent variable is presented in the rows."
7410,马尔萨斯(Malthus，1970:101)认识到“不幸”必然会在某处降临，并且认为，积极阻止饥荒、疾病和贫穷的人必然是下层阶级。,"Malthus (1970: 82) recognizes that ""misery"" has to fall somewhere and main-tains that the positive checks of famine, disease, and poverty will necessarily be the lot of the lower lasses."
7410,他们的悲惨境地是自然法的结果，这一法则“绝对不受任何人类控制”而发挥作用。,"Their miserable condition is the result of a natural law which functions ""absolutely independent of all human regulation."""
7410,因此，他们的不幸被解释成“一种非人类灵性所能影响的深层罪恶” (Malthus，1970:101)。,"Their distress is to be interpreted as ""an evil so deeply seated that no human ingenuity can reach it"" (Malthus, 1970: 101)."
7411,访问者完成问卷需要访问者在现场，而自填式问卷则不需要。,"Interviewer-completed questionnaires require the presence of an interviewer, whereas self-completion questionnaires do not."
7411,与访问者完成问卷相比，自填式问卷的回答率较低。这是因为在问卷完成过程中缺乏面对面的交流。,Response rates are lower for self-completion questionnaires compared with interviewer-completed questionnaires due to lack of face-to-face interaction during questionnaire completion.
7411,访问者完成问卷可以借助更多的视觉辅助，例如演示卡片和有形画面。因此，相对于自填式问卷每个参与者需人手一份问卷，访问者完成问卷则只需一套问卷装置供访员使用即可。,"More visual inputs can be used with interviewer-completed questionnaires, such as show cards and visual images, as the interviewer only needs one set as opposed to multiple copies for each participant in self-completion questionnaires."
7412,但是，一种直觉意义上的内在的自然价值也得到了广泛的传播，在某种程度上肯定了这样的观点：“自我实现”(无论是在狭义的、自我本位的或“深层”的意义上)并非外在于自我与自然的亲密关系。,"But an intuitive sense of intrinsic natural value is also widespread, partly in recognition of the idea that ""Self-Realization"" (whether it be in a narrow, egotistical, or ""deep"" sense) is not outside of some sort of intimate relation of self to nature."
7412,对道德价值和环境伦理学的研究创造了社群政治学，并且把环境问题完全纳人文化政治学的框架。,The search for moral values and an environmental ethic evokes community politics and brings the environmental issue fully within the frame of cultural politics.
7412,它同时把环境问题纳入官僚意见以及调节的/法律的/管理的制度话语的范围。,It also brings it within the purview of bureaucratic opinion and the regulatory/legal/administrative discourse of institutions.
7413,但是，价值不仅取决于“我”与“他”在时空中的关系，而且也根据社会实践和社会/权力关系而改变。,"But value is not only conditional on the relation between the ""I"" and the ""other"" in space and time; it also changes according to social practices and social/power relations."
7413,因此，这种透视观点依靠社会实践的连续变化，融合成一种更为普遍的时间和空间相关性观点，这些实践通过在“我”和“他”之间创造一种特殊的时空纽带，而赋予其价值。,"The perspectival view then merges into a more general relational view of space and time by virtue of the continuous shifts of social practices that put value upon both the ""I"" and the ""others"" by creating a particular space-time nexus between them."
7413,这与穆恩的观点(参阅本书第九章)有点相似，穆恩认为，待客和库拉贝壳交换打开了新的自我-他人关系的时间/空间，价值便通过这种时空实践而产生。,There is a similarity here to Munds arguments (see chapter 9) concerning the production of value through spatiotemporal practices which open a new time/space of self-other relations through hospitality and kula shell exchanges.
7414,对自治的要求以及实现这个目标的技术性问题，大城市和小地方是不同的。,Both the demands on self-government and the techniques for it differ in big cities from the demands and techniques in smaller places.
7414,比如，存在着一个陌生人的问题。把城市的街区看成是城市自治或自我管理的机构，我们必须首先要抛弃关于街区的一些正统的但没有切中要害的观念，这些观念或许适用于小城镇的社区，但不适用于大城市。,"For instance, there is the problem of all those strangers.To think of city neighborhoods as organs of city self-government or self-management, we must first jettison some orthodox but irrelevant notions about neighborhoods which may apply tocommunities in smaller settlements but not in cities."
7415,出于同样的原因，象征之地的创造并非命中注定，而是一种辛苦的耕耘和斗争，因为地方能够凭想象存在。,"By the same token, the creation of symbolic places is not given in the stars but painstakingly nurtured and fought over precisely because of the hold that place can have over the imaginary."
7415,宗教在世俗社会中作为主要制度成功地生存下来部分是通过对象征之地的成功创造、保护和培育。,"The survival of religion as a major institution within secular societies has been in part won through the successful creation, protection, and nurturing of symbolic places."
7415,但是，想象并不那么容易被操纵和驯化，以服务于特定的政治经济目标。,But imaginations are not easily manipulated or tamed to specific political–economic purposes.
7416,中位数能够使我们求出分布的中点，并且能够理解在中点两侧总体的分布。,The median enables us to determine the middle point of a distribution and to understand the distribution of the population on either side of the middle point.
7416,平均值告诉我们所研究类别的近似可接受值——平均数值。,"The average tells us an approximate acceptable value for a category being studied — that is, the average score."
7416,总之，这三种量数能够告诉我们研究的样本所代表的分布类型。,"Together, the three measures can tell us about the type of distribution being represented by the sample being studied."
7417,公共住宅本身并不是一个目的，它只能是达到目的的一种手段，这个目的是把我们的城市变成适合居住的地方，只有这样，它才能证明自己是一种正确的手段。,Public housing is not properly an end in itself.It can only be justified as a means to an end of making our cities fit places in which to live.
7417,公共住宅应该是一种什么样的形式呢？,What kind of public housing should it be?
7417,……随着租房者收入的增加，房租应该增加，但不能因为他的收入增加很多而不被允许住在这里。,. . .The tenant's rent should be increased with his increase in income and he should not be evicted as an over-income tenant.
7417,当租费上涨到一定的程度，可以抵消他的抵押贷款时（假如他可以购买而不是租赁他现在的住宅，而且从不太严格的抵押贷款的角度看），他所租的房产就应该以账面价格转让给他，而他的房租则可以支付贷款。,"When his increasing rent reaches the point at which it will cover debt service, on liberal mortgage terms, then the property should be deeded to him at its book value and his rent converted into a mortgage payment."
7418,直立，按照合桥（第九式）的运动过程，做出标准桥式（图104）。,Stand up straight and perform a closing bridge (Step 9) into a full bridge hold (fig. 104).
7418,双臂伸直，同时弯曲膝盖，将体重转移至双腿。,"From this position, shift your weight forwards through the thighs, and bend the knees as you straighten your arms."
7418,双手（最后是手指）用力按压地面，使手掌离地，同时继续向前转移体重。,"Continue gradually shifting your weight forwards as your press through the hands and finally the fingers, lifting the palms off the floor."
7418,此时，如果你的后背足够柔韧以维持高度的弓形，腹部又足够有力，在你起身时手指会离地（图105）。,"At this point, provided your back is flexible enough to maintain a high arch, and your stomach is powerful enough, your fingers will leave the ground as you start to straighten yourself up (fig. 105)."
7418,这个向上的运动过程应该是平缓向前转移体重的结果，而非用双手以爆发力推地面的结果。,"This upwards motion should be the consequence of a smooth forwards transfer of your bodyweight, not the result of an explosive push off the floor with the hands."
7418,继续向上运动，双手绕过肩部收回，颈部也收回，与身体成一直线。,"Continue the movement, drawing your hands back over your shoulders and pivoting the neck up in line with the body."
7418,最后，将髋部拉回，成直立姿势，双手回到身体两侧。,"Finally, pull the hips in until you are standing straight with hands by your sides."
7418,这是该动作的结束姿势（图106）。,This is the finish position (fig. 106).
7418,从直立姿势做成标准桥式，然后把自己从下向上拉回成直立姿势，就是一次完整的铁板桥。,"Going from standing up, down to a full bridge hold, then straightening yourself back up to the standing position again constitutes one full repetition of the stand-to-stand bridge."
7418,重复练习，保持正常呼吸。,"Repeat the exercise, breathing normally."
7419,为了进一步分析尼卡宁的传媒表征，我们从德勒兹的视角出发，将现代主义自我建构的二元模式问题化（例如：男性化/ 女性化，男人/ 孩子，冠军/ 退役，好/ 坏，体育英雄/ 酗酒者，有决心的/ 迷失的，理性的/ 失控的）。,"To further analyze the media representations of Nykanen, we draw on aDeleuzian perspective to problematize the dualistic scheme of modernistconstruction of the self (e.g., masculine/feminine, man/child, champion/retired, good/bad, athletic hero/alcoholic, determined/lost, rational/outof control)."
7419,德勒兹和瓜塔里（Deleuze & Guattari，1987 ) 使用术语“ 肖像特征” 来连接这些二元化的特征。,"Deleuze and Guattari (1987) used the term ""faciality trait"" toconnect these binary characteristics."
7419,在这种语境下，一个个体必须选择二元划分后的其中一侧站队：男性化的、好的一侧被德勒兹和瓜塔里加以“ 多数主义” 形象的标签。,"In this context, an individual is required to take up a position on either side of the binary divide: the masculine, good side is labelled by Deleuze and Guattari as the ""majoritarian"" face."
7420,本组也包括与5a-还原酶（Sot- reductase) 缺乏有关的各种综合征， 5a- 还原酶会将睾酮降解为二氢睾酮 (dihydrotestosterone)。,"This group also includes the syndromes associated with deficiency of 5a-reductase, the enzyme that reduces testosterone to dihydro-testosterone."
7420,"来自多米尼加共和 国的一系列报告描述了一些家庭将染色体为46, XY的孩子喂养成为女子的情况， 这些孩子在青春期获得了可观程度的男性 第二特征。","A series of reports concerning patients in the Dominican Republic have described families with a 46, XY chromosomal complement raised as females, who underwent a  striking degree of virilization at puberty."
7420,出生时的外生殖器具有女性的 外表，在整个童年只有一个会阴开口和很短的阴道。,The genitalia had a female appearance at birth and throughout childhood w ith a single perineal opening and a short vaginal pouch.
7421,如果你经常从肺部咳出黏液 (并不是只有流鼻涕时才排出黏液，那通常是鼻窦炎引起的），那么请考虑补充N-乙酰半胱氨酸。,"If you routinely cough up mucus from your lungs (rather than mucus coming out only when you blow your nose, which is usually from sinus conditions), consider N-acetylcysteine."
7421,这种物质能够减少黏液分泌，促进谷胱甘肽的生成，有助于防止细胞受损。,"It’s a substance that loosens mucus and boosts production of a substance called glutathione, which helps prevent damage in lung tissue."
7421,我们建议每日补充N-乙酰半胱氨酸两次，每次600毫克。,We recommend 600 milligrams twice daily.
7421,（对重症监护病人，我们买际上使用的是一种与N-乙酰半胱氨酸有关的化合物。）,"(By the way, we actually use a related compound with intensive care patients.)"
7422,比如，饱和脂肪会阻塞通往脑部的动脉血管，增大中风的发病几率。脂肪酸（存在鱼中）对人脑有益，因为omega-3脂肪酸能保持动脉血管的通畅。,"Saturated fats, for example, clog arteries that lead to your brain, putting you at increased risk of stroke, while omega-3 fatty acids those fats found in fish—are helpful for your brain because they help keep your arteries clear."
7422,它还能改变人体的神经递质，减少抑郁症的发生。,They also alter your neurotransmitters and reduce depression.
7423,对普通训练者来说，这是个非常值得自豪的成就。如果你的训练就一直停在这个动作上，那也绝对不是什么丢脸的事。,"The average athlete should be incredibly proud of such an achievement, and there’s absolutely no shame in leveling off your training at that point."
7423,与健身房里的“行尸走肉”所能达到的成就相比，你已经领先了几光年。,It’s an accomplishment light years ahead of what the average gym-trained zombie could ever attain.
7423,但是总有些人想要走得更远。,But some of you will want to go further.
7423,如果你也属于这群精英，我建议你把眼光放在最强有力的中段练习动作——V字举腿——上。,"If you are one of this elite group, I would advise setting your sights to the most powerful midsection exercise possible—the V raise."
7424,"根据第六章所介绍的,偏态系数与峰度系数主要是用以描述资料分布特性的咨询。",Recall from chapter 6 that skewness and kurtosis provide information about the nature of the distribution.
7424,这边所采用的Z分数的方式来呈现，0.0 则表示为常态分布。,"Here they are given in the form of a z score, where 0.0 indicates a normal distribution."
7424,在肱二头肌皮下脂肪资料中，偏态系数大于1表示资料的分布是倾向右偏分布，峰值系数接近2，表示资料的分布是较集中的；而在前臂皮下脂肪的部分，资料的偏度一样是呈现右偏的分布情况，在峰度系数的部分，其资料分布呈现更集中的分布，由此可知两个数量似乎都不是常态的分布。,"For the biceps skinfold, the skewness is above +1.0, indicating that the hump of the curve is shifted to the left.The kurtosis is nearly +2.0, indicating that the distribution is very peaked.For the forearm skinfold, the hump of the curve is also shifted left, and the curve is extremely peaked.Neither data set seems to be normal in its distribution."
7425,应用Z评定方法，人们能够回答诸如一名纵跳得分48cm的14岁男孩，是否将在21岁时加入国家排球队的问题。,"Applying the Z strategy, one can address questions such as whether a 14-year-old boy with a vertical jump score of 48cm will be on the national volleyball team at the age of 21."
7425,为了回答这个问题，已知国家队平均纵跳得分是72cm。,"To answer this, the mean vertical jump score of the national volleyball team is determined (72 cm)."
7425,通过将此数值与一般人群在该年龄的均值进行比较并除以标准差（3cm），我们得出Z值为4。,By comparing this value to the population mean for that age (60 cm) and dividing by the standard deviation (3cm) we obtain a Z value of 4.
7426,若要获得线性关系中近似常态的样本分配，最佳的方法是将相关系数转换成Z值（Z value)，此方法通称为费雪尔Z转换(Fisher Z transformation)。,The most satisfactory method of approximating normality of a sampling distribution of linear relationships is by transforming coefficients of correlation to Z values.This is often called the Fisher Z transformation.
7426,(请注意，此Z不应该与用来表示常态曲线纵坐标高度的z搞混。）,(This Z should not be confused with the z used to refer to the height of the ordinate in the area of the normal curve.)
7427,其他控制内在效度威胁的方式包括安慰剂、单盲及双盲设计。,Other ways of controlling threats to internal validity include placebos and blind and double­blind setups.
7427,安慰剂 (placebo)是用来评估观察到的效果是来自实验处理或心理效果。,A placebo is used to evaluate whether the observed effect is produced by the treatment or is a psychological effect.
7427,通常控制条件是研究对象接受到实验者的关注与互动程度一样，只不过采取的实验处理和依变项的表现无关。,"Frequently, a control condition is used in which participants receive the same attention from and interaction with the experimenter, but the treatment administered does not relate to performance on the dependent variable."
7428,L-肉毒碱是一种氨基酸，它促进了人体细胞间能量的传递。在动物试验中，L-肉毒碱已被证实能抵抗动脉老化，提高记忆能力。,"L-carnitine is an amino acid that helps transfer energy between our cells; and in animal studies, it s been shown to decrease arterial aging and improve memory."
7428,对于60岁以上的人士，我们建议每日补充1500毫克L-肉毒碱。,"For people over sixty, we recommend 1,500 milligrams daily of L-carnitine."
7429,点燃悉尼奥运火炬台的过程并没有如计划中那样进行。,The lighting of the Sydney Olympic cauldron did not go exactly as planned.
7429,一个反常的电讯信号导致控制从观众升起的火炬台的电脑出现运转失灵，这220秒能让组织者感到就像是永远那么长。火炬台在弗里曼的头顶卡住了，乐队不得不一遍一遍反复演奏柏辽兹的“赞主曲”（TeDeum），直到在体育场腹部工作的工程师们找到问题所在，启动备用救急装置。,"A freak telecommunications signal caused a glitch in the computer that controlled the raising of the cauldron through the crowd.For 220 seconds, what would seem to the organisers like an eternity, the cauldron was stuck above Cathy Freeman's head, with the band playing the same musical chord of Berlioz’s Te Deum over and over again, until the engineers working in the bowels of the stadium were able to track the problem and override the safety mechanisms."
7430,如果你在厨房窗户旁边煮着一锅面条，这扇窗户就会因蒸汽而模糊，你也就无法看到窗户外面。,"If you boil a pot of pasta by the kitchen window, the window's going to steam up so you can't see out of it."
7430,这就是白内障产生的影晌：遮蔽眼球的晶状体，造成你的视线模糊。,That's what cataracts do: cloud the lens of your eye to cause blurry vision.
7430,许多物体，包括紫外线、香烟雾以及糖尿病人体内多余的葡萄糖（这些都是加快人体血管衰老的因素）都能够加大白内障的发病率。,"Many things, including UV light, cigarette smoke, and extra glucose in people with diabetes (things that accelerate arterial aging), can increase the risk of cataracts."
7431,这种救赎的叙事出现于体育和主流出版物之上，最终 “超越了美国体育世界”，在 1999年促生了一种新的白人男子气概。这种气概是“战略上同时女性化也男性化的...对于财富矛盾的...内部冲突的、家庭导向的，总的说来，尝试驾驭与社会特权之间的关系”。,"This redemptive narrative appeared in both sports and mainstream publications and ultimately ""transcended the American sports world"", promoting a new, White masculinity beginning in 1999 that is ""both strategically feminized.. .and musculinized.. .ambivalent toward wealth.. .internally confliceted, family oritented, and in general, attempting to manage its relationship to social privilege""."
7431,阿加西的传媒再现是一个关键，库茨将其称之为从20世纪90年代到21世纪的 “白色起义”:“对于白人在主流美国流行文化中所代表的意义的公开斗争。”,"The media representation of Agassi was key in what Kusz termed the ""white revolt"" of the 1990s to 2000s, a ""public struggle over the meanings assoicated with whiteness in mainstream American popular culture""."
7432,人体渴望伤口痊愈，用“有害”胆固醇填补患处，“灰泥”会用得过多，高出血管壁上的破裂口。,"In its zeal to heal, it starts convering up the damage with the ""bad"" cholesterol, slapping it on like too much plaster over a hole in a wall."
7432,而这还只是个开头，此举还会刺激免疫系统，吸引来白细胞试图实施保护，消除“有害”胆固醇，平复人体受到的伤害。,"And that's only the beginning, since it stimulates the immune system to attract white-cell protsctors to try to smooth out and gobble up the rotten cholesterol."
7432,白细胞会分泌有毒物质，这些物质通常情况下能对抗感染，而这时则会造成全面发炎。,"Those, in turn, spill some of their toxic contents that normally attack enemy infections, which causes generalized inflammation."
7433,但并不是所有的癌症都是肿瘤或肿块，这使得它们更难沴断。,But not all cancers are tumors or lumps—making them even more difficult to diagnose.
7433,血液类癌症，比如白血病就不是通常意义上的肿瘤，而是在骨髓中所积累的不正常的白细胞。它们聚集茌一起，使得健康的白细胞和红细胞 瀕临饿死，即使你的身体无法保证不被感染，也不能输送你所需要的氧。,"Blood-borne cancers such as leukemia are not like tumors in the usual sense.Instead, abnormal white blood cells accumulate in bone marrow and crowd or starve out healthy white and red blood cells making your body unable to protect itself against infection and unable to deliver as much oxygen as you need."
7434,找一堵墙，双手手掌平放在距离墙根约15到25厘米的地面上，双手与肩同宽。,"Approach a solid wall.Place your palms flat on the floor six to ten inches from the base of the wall, at about shoulder width apart."
7434,手臂尽量伸直，蹬起成靠墙倒立姿势（第三式）。,"Keeping your arms as straight as possible, assume the position and kick up into a wall handstand (Step 3)."
7434,你现在应该处于标准的靠墙倒立姿势——手臂伸直，身体收紧，背部略微向内弓，脚跟与墙壁轻轻接触。,"You should now be in the classic wall handstand starting posture; your torso should be braced, your arms straight, and your body should curve backwards slightly to the point where your heels make a gentle contact with the wall."
7434,这是半倒立撑的起始姿势（图113）。,This is the start position for the half handstand pushup (fig. 113).
7435,跪在地板上，双手撑地，双腿向后蹬直。,"From the kneeling position, place your palms on the floor and stretch your legs out behind you."
7435,双手与肩同宽，并处于上胸部的正下方。,"Your hands should be shoulder width apart, and directly below your upper chest."
7435,双腿双脚并拢，使支撑肌肉绷紧，使后背、髋部和双腿成一条直线。,"Your feet and legs should be kept together.Tighten your supporting muscles, so that your back, hips and legs stay locked in line."
7435,先伸直手臂，然后降低身体到大约一半臂长的高度，或者直到肘部弯成直角。,"Starting with the arms straight, lower yourself approximately half the length of your extended arms, or until your elbows form a right angle."
7435,控制下降高度的绝佳方式就是使用篮球或橄榄球——该动作处于最高点时，将身体置于球之上。,"An excellent way to establish how far to descend is to use a standard basketball or soccer ball.Position yourself over the ball at the top of the movement, so that the ball is directly below your hips."
7435,这是半俯卧撑的起始姿势（图7）。,This is the start position of the half pushup (fig. 7).
7436,这个动作需要借助一个篮球或足球来控制动作幅度。,The half bridge will require a basketball or soccer ball to monitor your form.
7436,坐在地上，把球放在自己身后的地上（靠近自己）。,"Sit down on the floor,placing the ball on the ground right behind you."
7436,向后躺，只有双肩和双脚在地面上，双脚与肩同宽或略窄，球支撑着腰部。,"Lay back so that you are lying down with only your shoulders and the soles of your feet on the floor.The feet should be shoulder width apart or a little closer, and the ball should be supporting the small of your back."
7436,如果你感觉这种姿势不舒服，在开始前可以在球上放上毛巾或坐垫。,"If you find this position uncomfortable, lay a folded towel or cushion over the ball before you begin."
7436,双手撑在头部两侧的地板上，手指指向脚。,"Place the hands alongside the head, with the palms flat on the floor and your fingers pointing towards your toes."
7436,然后，用手把双肩和头部推离地板，只用双脚、球和手掌支撑身体。,"Now press through the hands, pushing your shoulders and head off the floor so that only the soles of your feet, the ball, and your palms are supporting your bodyweight."
7436,这是该动作的起始姿势（图91）。,This is the start position (fig. 91).
7436,在这个姿势基础上髋部要尽力向上顶起，伸展手臂和双腿，抬起背部，直到背部完全离开球。,"From here, push the hips as high as you can, extending the arms and legs and lifting the back up until it is well clear of the ball."
7436,继续向上运动，直到背部形成完全的弧形。,Keep going until your back is fully arched.
7436,这是结束姿势（图92）。,"This is the finish position (fig, 92)."
7436,在最高处暂停一会，然后慢慢放低身体，回到起始姿势。,"Pause for a moment at the top, before lowering yourself slowly to the start position."
7436,在一组动作过程中，后腰只能轻轻接触球，而不能将整个身体的重量都压在球上。,"After starting the set, only descend until the small of your back lightly touches the ball—don’t rest your bodyweight on it."
7436,重复练习，尽量保持正常呼吸。,"Repeat, breathing as normally as possible."
7437,为了完整起见，还要提到半乳糖血症 (galactosaemia)问题。,"For completeness, galactosaemia is mentioned."
7437,也许，出生前或出生后卵巢功能衰竭是由异常的半乳糖代谢引起的，其后的表现是青春期的延迟。,"Pre-or postnatal ovarian failure is caused, perhaps, by an abnormal metabolite of galactose, and is later manifested by delayed puberty."
7437,这种疾病在出生时必须及时加以探察，可以通过强制性的筛检程序或围产期的各种症状来发现。,This condition should be detected at birth by the mandated screening procedure or by symptoms in the perinatal period.
7437,与患特纳氏综合征的年轻女子的一样，该病可以采用性类固醇疗法进行治疗。,Gonadal steroid hormone treatment is the same as noted for young women with Turner's syndrome.
7438,在半深蹲过程中，站立，双脚分开，与肩同宽或略宽。,"In the half squats, stand with the feet shoulder width apart, or slightly wider."
7438,脚尖不要完全平行伸向前方，而要略微向外。,Don’t keep your feet perfectly in line with one another; allow your toes to point very slightly outwards.
7438,双手放在髋部、胸部、肩部都可以——以舒适为前提。,"Place your hands in a comfortable position—on your hips, chest or shoulders is fine."
7438,弯曲髋部和膝盖，直到膝关节弯曲成90°——换句话说就是大腿与地面平行。,"Now bend at the hips and knees until your knees are angled at ninety degrees, or (in other words) your thighs are parallel to the floor."
7438,刚开始你可以借助一面镜子或是找朋友帮忙，直到能够自如地控制动作幅度。,You can use a mirror or ask a friend the first few times until your body learns the right depth.
7438,不要求快，也不要借助惯性起身，而要完全在肌肉控制下做整个动作。在最低点（半空中）坚持1秒钟，然后再回到起始姿势。,"Don’t rush the technique, and never bounce; pause in mid-air at the bottom position for a one count before returning to the start position under full muscular control."
7438,在整个动作过程中，背部始终要挺直，双脚脚跟始终不能抬离地面。,"Keep the back straight throughout the motion, and keep your heels flat on the floor."
7438,膝盖与脚尖应该始终朝向同一方向，深蹲时膝盖绝不要向内转，脚尖指向外有助于你做到这一点。,Your knees should always point in the same direction as your feet; don’t ever allow the knees to “track” inwards as you squat.The outwards angle of your toes will assist you with this.
7439,瓣膜在心脏永不停止的血液循环活动中扮演的角色极普通又极关键：瓣膜是门卫，阻止血液回流进刚刚离开的心室。,"The valves play a key and surprisingly basic role in the never-ending cycle of blood through the heart: They are doormen who keep the blood from retracing its journey, leaking backward into the chambers it has just left."
7439,在心房与心室之间，在心室与离开心室的血管之间，都有瓣膜。,"There are valves between each atrium and ventricle, and between each ventricle and the blood vessel that leaves it."
7439,血液流过后，瓣膜就会合上，发出我们在电视上听到的心跳声。,"As the blood swishes through, the valves slam shut, producing what we hear on TV as a heartbeat."
7440,棒球中的击球被人视为是所有运动中最难的挑战。试想：投球手戴着橡皮手套， 鼓足劲，然后朝本垒投出一个70~100mi/h的快球，飞到60ft(1ft≈0.3048m)远的地方。,"Hitting a pitched baseball has been regarded by some as the single most difficult challenge in all sports.Consider this: The pitcher toes the rubber, winds up, and delivers a 70 to 100 mph fastball toward home plate, 60 feet away."
7440,那里站着一个击球手，手持击球棒，他最佳的触球点大约有3in(1in≈25.4mm)长。,"There stands the batter, wielding a slab of lumber whose optimal point of contact with the ball is about 3 inches long."
7440,以球飞行的速度，从球被投出的时间到接触球棒有效的触球点大约有450ms。,"At the speed of the pitch, the time from the release of the ball to the hoped-for point of contact with the bat is about 450 milliseconds."
7441,许多英国人不会定期检査保养牙齿，因为在全国卫生福利规定中，牙科项目不能免费。,Many people in Great Britain don't have regular dental care because it's not provided free by the National Health Service.
7441,但是当他们因为胸痛去医院治疗时，医生会开给他们阿司匹林和抗生素治疗牙龈炎。医生们很清楚，心血管系统的老化和工作不畅与牙龈发炎有很大的关联。,"But when people in Great Britain go to the hospital with chest pain, they're given an aspirin, and an antibiotic for gum disease—because doctors know there's a strong link between the inflammation of gum disease and an aging and unstable cardiovascular system."
7442,其实，健美运动会让你暴饮暴食。,
7442,,Conventional bodybuilding is conducive to overeating.
7442,忘记你在杂志里看到的那些大块头吧，他们在大部分时间里都没办法保持那样的身材。,Forget the ripped pros you see in the magazines—no way do they look like that most of the time.
7442,只有在近乎变态地控制饮食数月之后，他们才能在短暂的赛季内拍出那样的照片。,"They only do their photo shoots during the brief competition season, after months of strict and unhealthy dieting."
7443,这是构成你的平衡系统的四种器官之一。（另外三个是你的视觉，它能帮你纠正平衡问题；你的本体感受，它负责告诉你身体器官相对的空间位置；还有你的小脑，它统合其他几部分为你提供平衡。）,"It’s one of the four things that make up your balancing system (the other three are your vision, which helps correct balance problems; proprioception, which is responsible for telling you where your body parts are relative to space; and your cerebellum, which integrates all the other parts to give you balance)."
7444,近年来，相对选择性β2-激动剂（β2-agonists)的发展，具有使支气管平滑肌松弛的作用，而对心脏的作用较小。,"Recent years have seen the development of relatively selective β-agonists, that have potent bronchial smooth muscle relaxant effect, with little cardiac stimulation."
7444,"这些药物，包括（美国）阿布特罗(albuterol)或（世界其他地方）沙丁胺醇 (salbutamol),奥西那林（metaproterenol)，特布他林（terbutaline)，比托特罗 (bitolterol),非诺特罗（fenoterol)和沙米特罗（salmeterol)是治疗哮喘中支气管痉挛的主要药物。不论是对慢性的或急性的支气管痉挛，也包括运动性哮喘有效。","These agents, including albuterol (USA) or salbutamol (rest of the world), metaproterenol, terbutaline, bitolterol, fenoterol and salmeterol, are the mainstay in the treatment of the bronchospastic component of asthma, be it chronic or acute, including EIA."
7445,有一个这个过程的例子可以在运动学习和控制领域中找到，Adams在 1971年提出在运动技巧学习中的闭锁环理论(closed-loop theory) 。,An example of this process can be found in the motor learning and control area.Adams (1971) proposed a closed-loop theory of motor skill learning.
7445,基本上，闭链式回路理论提出在运动学习中从运动中接受到回馈的讯息将与内部参考点(如记忆)进行一致性的比较，找出运动和预期的运动之间的差异。,"Basically, the closed-loop theory proposes that information received as feedback from a movement is compared with some internal reference of correctness (assumed to be stored in memory).Then the discrepancies between the movement and the intended movement are noted."
7445,最后，下次将尝试在运动时将动作调整为更接近运动的目标。,"Finally, the next attempt at the movement is adjusted to approximate the movement goal more closely."
7446,“六艺”部分的每一章都以“变式”部分收尾。,Every Big Six chapter rounds off with a short section called simply variants.
7446,六艺有许许多多不同的变式，并不是所有变式都囊括在十式中。,"There are a great many different variations of the Big Six, and not all of these are included within the ten steps."
7446,这一方面是因为不是所有变式都适合放在升级系列中，另一方面是因为没必要将某一动作的所有变式都囊括在一个计划中。,"This is partly because not all variations are suitable, and partly because to include every possible variation of the movement in a single program would be overkill."
7447,将指甲剪短、磨平，在向你自己的拇指和食指的皮脑加压力时，指甲只微微伸出。,Cut and file the nails so that they extend only slightly when applying pressure to the fleshy portion of your own thumb and index fingers.
7447,这样可以确保受试者感到舒服。,This ensures subject comfort.
7447,此外，当带领学生实验时，戴上橡皮手套，使用仔细修饰过的指甲也能进行标记和测量而不会失去精确性。,"Moreover, with properly groomed nails, landmarking and measuring can be done wearing rubber gloves without appreciable loss in accuracy as determined in student experiments."
7448,找一面墙，双手手掌平放在距离墙根约15到25厘米的地面上，双手与肩同宽。,Approach a solid wall and place your palms flat on the ground approximately shoulder width apart and about six to ten inches from the wall.
7448,双膝曲，蹬起靠墙成倒立姿势。,Bend at the knees and kick up against the wall into a handstand position.
7448,如果你从前几式一路练过来，那现在对此过程必然了如指掌。,If you have worked through the steps so far you will now be pretty expert at this.
7448,如果你已经找到了适合自己的上墙技巧，那也很好。重要的是培养肌肉，而不是上墙的方式。,"If you have developed your own technique, that’s fine—it’s the muscle-building portion of the exercise that’s of importance, not how you get there."
7448,上墙之后，只有双脚脚跟与墙壁接触，背部略微向内弯曲成弓形，双臂伸直。,"Once you have found the wall, keep contact with it through your heels, maintaining a slight backwards arch in your body.Your arms should be straight."
7448,这是标准倒立撑的起始姿势（图115）。,This is the start position of the handstand pushup (fig. 115).
7449,跪在地板上，双手撑地，双腿向后蹬直。,"From the kneeling position, place your palms on the floor and stretch your legs out behind you."
7449,双腿双脚并拢，双手与肩同宽，并处于上胸部的正下方。,"Keep your thighs and feet together, and ensure that the hands are below your upper chest and shoulder width apart."
7449,双臂伸直，臀部与脊椎成一条直线。,Straighten the arms.The hips and spine should be in line.
7449,这是标准俯卧撑的起始姿势（图9）。,This is the start position of the full pushup (fig 9).
7450,平躺在地上，弯曲膝盖，让双脚向臀部靠近，直至与其相距约15到20厘米。,"Lie on your back.Draw your feet in, bending the knees until your heels are approximately six to eight inches from your glutes."
7450,双脚与肩同宽或略窄，双手撑在头部两侧的地板上，手指指向脚，两肘指向天花板。,"The feet should be shoulder width apart or slightly closer.Place the hands alongside the head, with the palms flat on the floor and your fingers pointing towards your toes.Your elbows should be angled towards the ceiling at this point."
7450,这是该动作的起始姿势（图93）。,This is the start position (fig. 93).
7450,尽量把髋部向上抬，从而使身体离开地板。,"Now push the hips as high as you can, lifting the body from the floor."
7450,手臂和双腿继续用力推，直到背部形成优美的弧形。,"Continue pushing through your arms and legs until your back is well arched, and your hips are high."
7450,在完美的桥中，手臂要完全伸直。,"In the perfect bridge, your arms will be totally straight."
7450,头部尽量后仰，从而看到后面的墙壁。,"Allow the head to tilt backwards between the arms, so that you can look at the wall behind you."
7450,这是标准桥的结束姿势（图94）。,This is the finish position of full bridges (fig. 94).
7450,在最高处暂停一会儿，然后反向运动，有控制地放低身体——要平缓地降低，不要一下塌下来，这样你会受益更多。,"Hold this top position for a moment, before reversing your motion.Control your descent—you will gain more benefit from the exercise if you lower yourself smoothly than if you simply collapse."
7450,继续放低身体，直到髋部、背部和头部完全接触地面。,"Continue going all the way back down until your hips, back and head are resting completely on the floor again."
7450,这一连串动作就是一个标准的桥。完成相应的训练目标，整个过程尽量保持正常呼吸。,"This sequence constitutes one rep. Push yourself back up again for your target reps, breathing normally throughout."
7451,在标准深蹲过程中，直立，双脚分开，与肩同宽或略宽（取决于个人偏好）。,"In the full squats, stand tall, with the feet shoulder width apart or a little wider, depending upon your preference."
7451,双脚略微向外转，双臂随意摆放，只要舒服即可。,"Turn the toes slightly out, and place the arms in a comfortable position."
7451,髋部与膝关节弯曲，背部始终挺直。,"Bend at the hips and knees, keeping the back straight."
7451,当大腿达到几乎与地面平行时，把你的身体重心向后转移，就像要坐下一样。,"When your thighs reach approximately parallel to the floor, shift your weight backwards as if you were about to sit down."
7451,有控制地继续放低身体，直到大腿后侧紧贴小腿。,Continue descending at a controlled speed until the backs of your thighs are resting against your calves.
7451,暂停一会，然后仅靠腿部发力将自己推回到起始姿势。,Pause for a moment before pressing yourself back up with leg strength alone.
7451,起身过程和下蹲过程应该是完全相反的。,Your upward motion should be the reverse of your downward motion.
7451,脚跟始终不要抬离地面，膝盖也不能向内转。,"Don’t raise the heels, or allow the knees to track inwards."
7452,在做标准引体向上时，以正握姿势握住横杆，双手与肩同宽或略宽——你可以试试看多大宽度对你来说最容易发力。,"When doing full pullup, grab hold of a horizontal bar with a shoulder width overhand grip.A slightly wider grip is acceptable—experiment to find out which width feels strongest for you."
7452,双脚离地，双膝微屈，脚踝交叠在一起并置于身后。,Bend at the knee and loop the ankles behind your body.
7452,身体绷紧，双肩收紧，肘部略微弯曲（几乎看不出来），让肌肉而不是肘关节承担压力。,"Your feet should be clear of the ground.Tense the body, keep the shoulders down tight and retain a very slight (almost unnoticeable) bend in the elbows to take the stress off the arm joints and place it on the muscles instead."
7452,弯曲肘部，夹起肩部，直至下巴超过横杆。,Bend at the elbows and shoulders until your chin passes over the bar.
7452,欣赏一下上面的风景吧！,Enjoy the view!
7452,暂停一会，然后有控制地反向运动。,"Pause for a moment, before reversing the motion under full control."
7452,不要做爆发式动作，否则惯性就会参与进来。,Don’t be explosive—this means depending on momentum during the exercise.
7452,平缓的动作是练出肌肉的完美技巧。,The perfect muscle-building technique is smooth.
7452,试着用2秒钟将自己拉起来，再用2秒钟缓慢地放低身体，并在动作的最高点和最低点各停顿1秒钟。,"Try to take two seconds up and two seconds down, pausing for a second at the top and bottom."
7453,许多人用治疗的方法来区分细菌和病毒：细菌用抗生素治疗，病毒却不用。其实并非完全这样。对于艾滋病来说有许多抗病毒治疗方法。,Many people distinguish between bacteria and viruses by treatment: bacteria respond to treatment with antibiotics; viruses don't.But that's not entirely true—there are many antiviral medications for AIDS.
7453,这两种有机体的主要区别跟它们的结构、大小和功能有关。,"The main differences between the two types of organism have to do with their structure, size, and function."
7453,细菌是更复杂的细胞，它们有能力复制自身，病毒却比它们小一百倍，结构更简单，无法复制自身。,"Bacteria are complex cells that have the ability to replicate themselves; viruses are about a hundred times times smaller, much simpler on a cellular level, and without the tools to replicate themselves."
7454,如果你眼睛中看到这些点，它们甚至会多到好像你在天文馆中看到的天上的星星。,
7454,,"If you have enough of them, it seems as if you can see a planetarium in your line of vision."
7454,虽然你也许第一次注意到这些小黑点有干扰，它们实际上是无害的。,"Though those little black dots can be disturbing the first time you noice them, they're actually harmless unless they're increasing in frequnecy."
7454,它们是浮在你眼中的玻璃状流体周围的小斑点，这种现象通常是由于某种形式的外伤（例如车祸），或是过长地戴眼镜或是流泪、过度用眼、揉眼等造成的。,"They're little specks that float around the vitreous fluid in your eye and are usually caused by some form of trauma (like a car accident), or through a lifetime of optical wear and tear——（破则号）lifting, traning, and rubbing your eyes."
7455,从健康长寿的观点看，性对人类生活无比重要。因此我们不应该羞于谈论情欲亢进、射精和性无能这些事情。,"Since sex is such an important part of our lives from a health and longevity standpoint, we shouldn't be embarrassed to talk about things like orgasm, ejaculation, and impotence."
7455,日前，我们有了一些进步。,"Recently, we have made some strides."
7455,例如，身为伟哥形象代言人的棒球硬汉拉菲尔•帕尔梅洛曾说，有人和他讨论勃起功能障碍的问题。,For example，several spokesmen for Viagra said that they did it not for the money but because somebody had to come forward to talk about the problem of erectile dysfunction.
7456,药物治疗之前最为普遍的降压步骤的第一步就是减少食物中盐的摄入量，因为盐能够阻碍身体中的水。,A common first step before trying medications is to reduce salt intake in your food since the salt traps water in the body.
7456,但是只有一部分有高血压的人对盐极端敏感，因此这种方法经常无法完全解决问题。,"But only a few people with hypertension are extremely salt-sensitive, so this approach often fails to correct the problem."
7456,但是通过长期（很多年）严格限制饮食中的盐摄入量，或定期服用补水类药物或利尿剂（欧芹是天然的利尿剂）也能将盐分驱除出你的血管和身体。,"Instead, the salt can be chased out of the artery wall—and thus the body—with long-term (years of) salt restriction in the diet or regular use of a water pill or diuretic (parsley is a natural diuretic)."
7457,在出生时和出生第一周内能够被诱发出来的并能够正常消失的反射动作称为简单反射（primitive)。,Reflexes that can be elicited at birth or during the first weeks of life and normally disappear were often called primitive.
7457,有些姿势性反射（postural reflexes)也是在出生后的第一年里消失。,Some postural reflexes also disappear during the first year.
7457,"例如，不对称的张力性颈部反射（asymmetrical tonic neck reflex, ATNR)在出生后2-3个月时减弱，但是多数姿势性反射并不减弱，反而变成更复杂的成熟的动作行为。","For instance the asymmetrical tonic neck reflex (ATNR) declines at around 2 or 3 months of age.However, most postural reflexes do not decline, instead becoming integrated into mature motor behaviours."
7458,不溶性纤维不易溶于水，也不会被肠道细菌分解。,Insoluble fiber doesn't easily dissolve in water and is not broken down by intestinal bacteria.
7458,（这种纤维不能降低人体的E固醇含量，但对消化系统还是有益的。,(This type doesn't lower your cholesterol but still has an effect on your digestive system.)
7458,）不溶性纤维常见于葡萄柚、橙、葡萄干、果干、马铃薯、豌豆和绿皮西葫芦，特别是在全麦或全谷类面包中含量高（一定要全麦面包才含有足量纤维）。,"Its found in grapefruit, orange, grapes, raisins, dried fruit, sweet potatoes, peas, and zucchini, but especially in whole-wheat or whole-grain bread (it has to be whole-grain, not five- or six-grain bread, to have enough fiber)."
7458,可溶性纤维溶于水，它能调节新陈代谢和消化作用，稳定人体血糖值。,Soluble fiber does dissolve in water; it regulates metabolism and digestion and stabilizes blood glucose levels.
7459,女性购物时，她们是“逛街”。,"When women shop, they browse."
7459,她们比较各种商品，根据无数的外界因素做决定，她们走出商店的时候，“收获”有一大瓶布洛芬、最新一期《人物》杂志和给母亲的生日卡（虽然母亲的生日在六个月后）。没有一样东西是购物单上列过的。,"They assess options, they make decisions based on numerous outside factors, and they could come out of the store with a large bottle of ibuprofen, the latest issue of People, and a birthday card for Mom (even though her birthday isn't for six months)—none of which was on the list to begin with."
7459,这种现象并不说明一种性别比另一种更聪明，更有效率，这只是说明我们分析处理信息的方式是不同的。,It doesn't mean one's smarter or more efficient than the other; it just means we assess and process information differently.
7460,节奏训练：“节奏”也就是步颇。理想的步频是每分钟180次 （意味着每分祌每只脚落地90次 ）。,Cadence training.“Cadence” refers to stride rate.The ideal cadence is 180 steps per minute (meaning that each foot touches the ground 90 times per minute).
7460,为了记录步频，我们可以设置一个电子节拍器，节奏设定为每分钟180次，然后让脚步跟上这个节拍。,"To track your cadence, set a small electronic metronome at 180 and match the beat."
7460,刚开始训练步频时，你可能很难保持这个节奏，但是当神经系统和肌肉适应了更快的节奏以后，你的步频会更快，动作也会更自然。,"When you start working on cadence, it can seem hard to sustain, but after you’ve exposed your nervous system and muscles to the faster pattern for a while, the new faster stride rate will come to feel natural."
7461,运动还能促使血管扩张，让血管更有弹性，从而增强血管强度。,The exercise may also strengthen blood vessels by forcing them to dilate and perhaps making them more clastic.
7461,如果你已有一段时间没运动，可以先从步行开始，直到能够做举重运动，然后再加入一些其他运动方式如骑自行车、游泳和使用简单运动器材，以提高心率（长期跑步往往会给关节施加过多压力）。,"If you haven't exercised in a while, start with walking until you can do weight lifting and then add some kind of activity—cycling, swimming, using an elliptical trainer—to elevate your heart rate (running chronically often stresses your joints too much)."
7461,通过加入力量训练（我们会在第4章讨论这一点），然后再进行耐力训练，55岁男性平均生理年龄能年轻8岁，而55岁的女性能年轻9.1岁。,"By adding strength training, which we'll discuss in Chapter 4, and then stamina training, the average fifty-five-year-old man becomes eight years younger in RealAge, and a fifty-five-year-old woman makes herself 9.1 years younger."
7462,参数不变性表示由任何受试者的团体算出的项目难度都是相同的。,Parameter invariance means that the item difficulty remains constant regardless of the group of examinees.
7462,而题目的鉴别能力则以曲线的陡峭程度来表示。,The discriminating power of the item is indicated by the steepness of the curve.
7462,试题特征曲线可以用来分析题目的难度、题目的鉴别能力、以及猜测参数。,"The Iconvict conditioning can be used to analyze the difficulty of the item, the discriminating power of the item, and a so-called guessing parameter."
7463,图8.2表示此最佳适配线，可以看到分数并没有落在直线上，跟完美相关性的例子不同。,"Figure 8.2 shows this line of best fit.You can readily see that the scores do not fall on the straight line, as they did with the perfect correlation example."
7463,预测和实际Y分数之间的差异代表预测误差，称为残差分数。,These differences between predicted and actual Y scores represent the errors of prediction and are called residual scores.
7463,如果计算所有的残差分数，所得到的平均值为零，且标准偏差为预测标准误。,"If we compute all the residual scores, the mean is zero, and the standard deviation is the standard error of prediction."
7464,我们处理外界信息，一般是将信息从感觉器官直接送至脑皮层，我们可以在这里处理感知到的信息。,"We usually process outside information by passing it directly from the sensory organ to the cortex, where we process what we have learned."
7464,人眼将图像信息送至丘脑，人耳将声音和平衡信息送至顶骨叶。,The eyes send images to the occipital lobe; and the ears send sound and balance information to the parietal lobe.
7464,但是，嗅觉的情况比较特殊。,But smell is unique.
7464,气味通过位于择梁顶端的槽状软骨，刺激嗅球神经。,An odor passes through the cribiform plate at the top of the nose and stimulates the olfactory nerve.
7464,这种神经绕过能过滤信息的脑皮质，将信息送至人脑最初始的部分（杏仁核），在这里，情感反应几乎都是由潜意识产生的。,"This nerve bypasses the cortex, which filters information, and sends the information to the most ancient part of our brain (amygdala), where emotional responses occur almost subconsciously."
7465,测试者间信度( intertester reliability) 也是以上述相同的程序来决定。,Intertester reliability is determined by the same procedures we just outlined.
7465,因此，不同评分者或施测者之间的客观性就以组内的R值来分析，其中评分者与评分者间的变异量则以和测试间变异量相同的方式来处理。,"Thus, the objectivity of judges or different testers is analyzed by intraclass R, and judge-to-judge variance is calculated in the same way as trial-to-trial variance."
7465,当然，可以用更复杂的ANOVA设计来辨识不同测试之间、不同日期之间、不同评分者之间的变异量来源。,"Of course, more complex ANOVA designs can be used in which trial-to-trial, day-to-day, and judge-to-judge sources of variance all can be identified."
7465,Baumgartner ( 1989) 与 Satiit (1976)对。一些可以建立信度的模式有详细讨论。,Baumgartner (1989) and Safrit (1976) discussed some models that can be used for establishing reliability.
7466,人们正在不断地开发着新的工具以发现癌症。,And new tools for detection are constantly being developed.
7466,"比如说常规乳房手术内窥镜检查（ROBE),是用窥镜放大乳房组织60倍，可以找到比乳房X线照片找到的小一百倍的肿瘤。","The routine operative breast endoscopy (ROBE), for instance, uses a viewing scope to magnify breast tissue up to sixty times its normal size and identify tumors 1/100th the size of what can be picked up on mammograms."
7466,早期探测到乳腺癌的治疗通常可以由乳房肿瘤切除术进行，即摘除肿块。,"With early detection of breast cancer, the treatment can usually be handled by a lumpectomy—the removal of the lump."
7467,大部分的教科书中不会特别介绍常模调査。,The normative survey is not described in most research methods textbooks.
7467,如同名称所指出的，这种调查的目的在于建立能力、表现、信念和态度等的参照基准。,"As implied by the name, this method involves establishing norms for abilities, performances, beliefs, and attitudes."
7467,所使用的是横断面的研究：即筛选并量测不同年龄、性别 、及其它特定类别的受试者。,"A cross-sectional approach is used: Samples of people of various ages, both sexes, and other classifications are selected and measured."
7468,抄袭(plagiarism) 指的是用别人的想法、概念、著作或制图当成你自己的。,"Plagiarism means using the ideas, writings, or drawings of others as your own."
7468,当然，在研究过程中这是完全不能接受的（包括写作）。,"Of course, this is completely unaccpetable in research process (including writing)."
7468,抄袭在所有机构有着严厉的罚则。,Plagiarism carries severe penalties at all institutions.
7469,做标准俯卧撑时，双手通常是在肩部或胸部正下方；而做超人俯卧撑时，你的双手则要平放在身体前方的地板上——超出你的头部，手臂几乎伸直。,"Full pushups are usually done with the hands at shoulder level or in line with the chest.In Superman pushups you do your reps with your hands flat on the floor way out in front of you, at nearly arm’s length."
7469,这时，你看起来就像是在飞翔，这个变式因此得名。,"In this position, you’ll look a little like you’re flying— hence the name."
7469,由于做这个动作时力臂变长，所以你的上胸部、胸小肌、背阔肌以及腋窝周围的肌腿将得到集中锻炼。,"Due to the increased leverage of this technique, Superman pushups strongly work the upper pectorals and pec minor, as well as the lats and the tendons around the armpits."
7469,由于手臂姿势如此，你放低身体时动作幅度减小了，这样一来肩部与肱三头肌得到的锻炼就比做标准俯卧撑时少多了。,"On the downside, due to the arm position, the range of motion of the exercise is decreased, and the important shoulders and triceps get significantly less work than in classic full pushups."
7469,因此，该练习（与宽距俯卧撑一样）并不会让你变得越来越强。如果不是为了强化胸部相对薄弱的区域，那你完全没必要练习这个动作。,"For this reason, this exercise (like wide pushups) won’t make you stronger at doing pushups, so unless you’re trying to fix a relative weakness in yourchest area, I’d avoid them."
7470,"成熟过程按生物系统自身规律变化,但在对生长的研究中常使用的成熟指标标志已经相当完善，包括骨骼的成熟，性成熟，青春期生长高峰时间以及在特定年龄下占成年人身高的百分比。","Maturation varies according to the biological system used, but the more commonly used maturity indicators in growth studies are reasonably well related.They include maturation of the skeleton, sexual maturation, timing of the adolescent growth spurt and percentage of adult stature attained at a given age."
7470,出牙和牙齿钙化偶尔也作为成熟期的标志，但不依赖其 他成熟期标志。,"Eruption and calcification of the teeth are occasionally used as maturity indicators, but they are independent of other maturity indicators."
7470,"所以，牙成熟在运动科学中的应用较为局限，一般不予考虑（见 Demirjian, 1986)0","Dental maturation thus has limited utility in the sport sciences and will not be considered (see Demirjian, 1986)."
7471,比如，短暂性局部缺血(T1A)是一种轻度中风，在这种情况下，动脉血管堵塞只会持续很短时间。,"A transient ischemic attack (TIA), for example, is a ministroke in which the arteries are blocked only a short time."
7471,TIA实际上是真正中风发作的前兆（虽然T1A较易治疗）。,A TIA is actually a precursor to a full stroke (though it's more easily treated).
7471,轻度中风反复发作会产生长期性影响，比如痴呆症，但是康复情况常常取决于脑部因缺血而受损的程度。,"Multiple small strokes can have long-term consequences, like dementia.But recovery always depends on how much brain injury occurred from the lack of blood supply to the braint."
7471,所以必须尽快采取措施。,So act quickly.
7472,Rowland:在结束这个话题之前，我们应该把这点也加上去，即除了出生日期，出生地似乎也很重要。,"Rowland: Before leaving this point, it should be added that in addition to birth date, location of birth also seems to be important."
7472,如果你想成为一个明星运动员，那你需要在Austin (奥斯汀）长大，而不是在纽约或者Miller’s Comers (米勒斯•康勒斯）。,"If you want to be a star athlete, grow up in Austin, not New York City or Miller’s Corners."
7472,好吧，这是有一点夸张的成分，但是关键点是，研究显示了一个不成比例的专业运动员的数量，他们都出生在拥有少于500000而多于10000人口的城市。,"Well, that’s a bit of hyperbole, but the point is that studies indicate a disproportionate number of professional athletes grow up in cities with populations less than 500,000 but greater than 10,000."
7473,大量的研究都证明了这种影响。,Numerous studies have documented this effect.
7473,青少年运动项目的参与者名单，特别是冰球等，相比于晚出生的人，则更倾向于早出生的人。,"Rosters of participants in youth sports, particularly hockey, are biased toward those with birth dates in the first portion of the year, as compared to the last."
7473,通常的解释是，那些年长一些的在生理上可能更成熟一些——更强壮，体重更大，身髙更髙——这在比赛中提供优势，这并不奇怪。,"The usual explanation is that those who are chronologically older are also more likely to be more biologically mature—stronger, heavier, and taller—offering a competitive advantage.No surprises here."
7473,但是这种对早出生的人的倾向，同样存在于那些青春期之后的很成功的年轻成人运动员中，这是很有趣的。,Yet it is intriguing that this same bias for early birth date is seen in highly successful young-adult athletes after puberty as well.
7473,关于专业的棒球、冰球、足球和篮球的一些研究都显示了根据赛季划分后，出生日期的偏移分布。,"Studies of competitors in professional baseball, ice hockey, soccer, and basketball have all indicated a skewing of birthdates toward the quarter of each year."
7474,如果你达不到初级标准的目标，那就继续去做半深蹲。如果你感到自己变强了，那就增加几厘米的动作幅度。,"If you cannot meet the beginner standard, return to doing half squats and slowly add an inch of depth to your technique whenever you get stronger."
7474,不要心急，一定不要借助惯性起身、让脚跟离地或是摇晃前倾。,"Don’t rush, and resist the urge to bounce or rock forwards onto your toes."
7474,要纯粹使用肌肉力量，否则就别练了！,"Use pure muscular power, or don’t bother!"
7475,传媒化的信息（例如新闻媒体报道） 并非事物的客观呈现。,"Mediated messages (e.g., news media coverage) are not objective accounts of events."
7475,相反地，媒体利用特定的阐释来误导他人（Fiske，1 9 9 6 )。,"Instead, the media privilege certain interpretations while multaneously discouraging others (Fiske, 1996)."
7475,"换句话说，那些包含在故事里的信息，更重要的是如何帮助“ 框架” 建构一个事件给读者或是观众的（Fiske, 1 9 9 6 )。","In other words, what is included in the story, and more importantly, how it is discussed help ""frame"" an event for the reader or viewer (Fiske, 1996)."
7476,在做垂直引体时，找一个可抓握且很稳固的竖直物体，门框和高一点的栏杆都是上好之选。,"In the vertical pullups, find a vertical base you can hold on to.This base should be secure and allow you to grip it safely; a doorframe or high railings are excellent potential candidates."
7476,靠近物体站立，脚尖与之保持约8厘米的距离。,Stand close to the base—the tips of your toes should be between three and six inches out.
7476,以舒服的姿势抓住该物体，理想情况是双手与肩同宽，但不必要——只要双手对称即可。,Take hold of the object in a comfortable grip.Ideally your hands should be shoulder width but any symmetrical position will suffice.
7476,由于你距离物体很近，所以手臂会弯曲。,"Because of your proximity to the base, your arms will be well bent."
7476,身体慢慢向后倾，在此过程中伸展手臂，直到手臂几乎伸直、身体后倾与地面成一定角度为止。,"Now allow your bodyweight to shift back by leaning slightly.Extend your arms as you go, until they are very nearly straight, and your body is angled diagonally backwards."
7476,此时，你的上背部应该有拉伸感，手臂可能也会有同感。,"At this point you will feel a gentle stretch in your upper back, and possibly your arms."
7476,暂停一会，再并拢肩胛骨并弯曲手臂，把身体拉回到起始姿势。,"Pause momentarily before pulling yourself back to the start position, by contracting the shoulder blades and bending the arms simultaneously."
7476,暂停，然后再重复该动作。,Pause and repeat.
7477,坐骨神经经过人体的脊柱下部，直达双脚。突出的椎间盘压迫坐骨神经时，会导致腿疼，这一情况可以帮助我们解释背痛的起因和严重性。,"The sciatic nerve passes from your lower spine to your feet; when a bulging disc compresses it, it causes leg pain, which helps indicate the cause and severity of back pain."
7477,医生不愿意切除突出的椎间盘来使脊柱恢复正常，因为这样附近椎间盘会承担多余的重量，使磨损提前。,Doctors do not like removing a disc and fusing the spine becouse the extra pressure on surrounding discs can cause premature damage.
7477,不过请注意：许多椎间盘突出患者并不会感到疼痛。有人感到关节痛和背痛，X光显示却是正常；还有人X光显示不正常，却一点也不觉得疼。,But be warned: Lots of folks have herniated discs without pain; many people have joint and back pain with normal X rays; others have abnormal X rays with no pain at all.
7478,大多数女孩看医生只是为了放心。,Most girls will require only reassurance.
7478,"如果需要治疗，通常是用促性腺性类固醇激素治疗，每天5~20fxg,治疗几个月。最常用的是每天0.3~0.6 mg复合雌性激素或乙基雌二醇。","If therapy is needed, it is usually with gonadal steroid hormones, often 0 .3—o.6 mg daily conjugatedequine oestrogens or ethinyl oestradio l5 —20 gg daily for several months."
7478,"如果治疗需要延长，可以慎重使用醋酸甲孕酮（medroxyprogesterone acetate),每月 10~14 天，每天 10 mg,来诱导月经周期。","If prolonged therapy is necessary, the addition of medroxyprogesteroneacetate 10 mg daily for 10 —14 days of each month to induce menstrual periods is prudent."
7478,后者极少用于体质性的发育延迟的女孩，但是必须用于低促性腺激素性功能低下症（hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism)的女孩（见后)。,"The latter is rarely necessary for girls with constitutional delay, but is required for those with hypogonadotrophic hypogon adism (see below )."
7479,随着我们年龄的增长，皮肤第三层脂肪细胞开始稀薄并变得崎岖不平。,"As we age, our fat cells in that third layer of skin thin out and get a little bumpier."
7479,这就是造成皮肤老化的外表会呈现像葡萄干形状的原因之一。,That's part of what causes the raisin-like appearance of older skin.
7479,然而，鱼油中和鲑鱼中的脂肪酸有助于皮肤这一层变厚而且变光滑，以赶走皱纹使皮肤变得更饱满。(通常，你应避免饱和脂肪，因为与此相关联的厚重的油会促使造成痤疮。）,"Somehow, the fatty adds (DHA specifically) in fish oil and salmon help make that layer a little thicker and smoother, so that wrinkles go away and the skin becomes fuller, (As always, you'll want to avoid saturated and trans fats because the heavy oils associated with them can promote acne.)"
7480,假如我们把自己的肠道拿出拉直 (我们当然不鼓励大家这样做），会从屋子前院延伸至二楼，一直通到阁楼窗户上。肠道一共有七八米长。小肠接在胃的后部，是吸收大部分食物的场所；大肠，或结肠，比小肠宽且短，吸收水分，产生粪便。,"If you were to stretch your intestines vertically out in front of you (which we highly discourage), they 'd reach from the ground in your front yard up past the second floor and all the way to your attic window. That's twenty-six feet of tubing—and this is where the serious plumbing takes place. The small intestine comes after the stomach and is the tubing where most of foods' nutrients are absorbed; the large intestine, or colon, is wider and shorter than the small intestine and absorbs water to form feces."
7481,大范围伸展的夹子。,Wide spreading caliper.
7481,大范围伸展的夹子是用于测量胸廓的厚度的，但是，人体测量器或者宽范围的滑动夹子带有内弯的双臂可以作为替代之用。,"The large wide spreading caliper (Siber-Hegner, GPM) is the instrument of choice for anteroposterior chest depth.However, anthropometers or wide sliding calipers with recurved branches may be used as a substitute."
7481,新型的Campbell-10型夹子有备用的橄榄枝样的指示器，用于测量胸廓的宽度。,The new Campbell Caliper 10 has optional olive-tipped pointers that attach for this purpose.
7482,大腿中部围度（mid-thigh girth)。,Mid-thigh girth.
7482,在大转子上缘到胫骨头之间的中点处，与股骨长轴呈直角时的围度。,Perimeter distance of the right thigh perpendicular to the long axis of the femur at the marked mid-trochanterion-tibiale level.
7482,将测量大腿围度的卷尺向下移动，用左手中指固定住，用左右手指确保卷尺是在标记的部位上并与股骨长轴呈直角。,"Simply drop the tape from the upper thigh measurement, pin with the third left digit and use both left and right digits to assure the tape is at the marked site and perpendicular to the long axis of the femur."
7483,在讨论了大众传媒构建从神坛上跌落下来的运动员引人注目的叙事过程之后，本章现在来探索运动员怎样通过大众传播恢复他们各自的形象。,"Having discussed the processes through which mass media construct dramatic narratives about athletes falling from grace, the chapter now examines how athletes attempt to restore their respective images through mass communication."
7483,关于危机传播的文献有助于阐释个体及组织所运用和实现的这些过程。,"Scholarly literature in crisis communication helps toelucidate these processes, which apply to both individuals and organizations."
7483,"危机，一般而言，就是创造一个“ 信息空洞” （Coombs, 2007) ，利益相关者必须尽快给事件下定义。","Crises, in general, create ""information voids"" (Coombs, 2007), and stakeholders must scramble to define events as quickly as possible."
7483,当知名运动员陷人法律困境或是经历个人逆境时，运动员和他们的经纪人必须快速行动，因为媒体会毫不犹豫地填补这一空洞（即报道新闻）。,"When highprofile athletes get in trouble with the law or experience some type of personal adversity, the athletes and their agents must move quickly, as the media will not hesitate to fill the void (i.e., report the news) based on a limited set of facts."
7484,他们通过观察运动员以同样的方式一个接一个地完成一系列短跑，解释了这一典型观察中功率逐渐下降的原因。,"They interpreted the progressive decline in power typically observed when a runner completes a series of sprints, one after the other, in the same way."
7484,反复短跑成绩下降的模式，实际上与先前描述的，单一的持续最大拇指肌收缩力量随时间推移产生下降的现象，是非常相似的。,"The pattern of performance falloff in repeated sprints is, in fact, very similar to that observed in the model of force production over time in the single sustained maximal contraction of the thumb muscle described previously."
7484,习惯上会把这种下降归因于局部代谢变化，但St.Clair Gibson和他的同事们认为，反复短跑总成绩的下降不一定与这些因素紧密相关。,"Such decreases have traditionally been attributed to local metabolic changes, but St. Clair Gibson and colleagues contended that the decline in performance in repeated sprints is not necessarily tightly related to these factors."
7485,"目前，已经发表了内容广泛的MET值表（Ainsworth et al., 1993)。","Recently, an extensive list of MET values has been published (Ainsworth et al., 1993)."
7485,该表的大多数数据是用间接热量测定法得到的实际数值。,Much of the data in this list are derived from actualmeasurements by indirect calorimetry.
7485,但是，在数据缺乏时，数值是依据经验推算出来的。,"However, when data were not available the figures were based  upon educated guesses."
7485,某些活动的数值不是从实际活动时得来的。,For someactivities the values are not those obtained during the actual execution of the activities.
7486,然而，CFE是一项针对体育运动的训练。,
7486,布莱恩.麦肯齐研发的CFE跑步训练计划是为比赛型跑者量身打造的，训练内容组合了跑步训练、力量训练和CrossFit代谢调节训练。,"A CFE running program, as Brian MacKenzie has developed it, prepares a runner for a race by combining specific running workouts, strength workouts, and CrossFit metabolic conditioning workouts."
7486,正如麦肯齐所主张的，使用CrossFit训练计划— 具有极大的健康和运动益处— 可以让跑者拥有同样的训练成果，即使不是最佳的运动表现，也能大大降低受伤的风险。,"As MacKenzie asserts, the use of CrossFit workouts—with their myriad health and athletic benefits—allows a runner to obtain equal if not greater performance results while simultaneously decreasing the chance of injury."
7487,如果你自己随意服用合成代谢类固醇、减肥药或治疗其他疾病的速效药，你就是在跟你的激素瞎胡闹，就会让身体出现故障。,"Anytime you try fiddling with your hormones on your own with anabolic steroids or fixes for weight loss or other ailments, you're causing your body to go haywire."
7487,比如我们经常会了解到一些运动员通过服用代谢类固醇药或补充剂，使其代谢产生睾丸酮。,"For example, we often read about athletes who take androgenic steroids or supplements that get metabolized through to testosterone."
7487,这些多余的睾丸酮会导致非常具有侵略性的行为，所以千万不要给服用者手枪，或者什么辩题，更别提这些药产生所有的副作用，像心血管病和肾脏类病。,"This excess tesfosterone can lead to very aggressive behavior—as in, don't give that man a gun or even an argument—not to mention all the side effects like cardiovascular and kidney problems."
7488,肌营养不良、脑瘫、骨发育不全和脊柱侧弯儿童的肌肉耐力下降，反映在行走时能耗较高和活动过少。,"Muscle endurance is also reduced in children with MD, CP , OI and scoliosis and may reflect the high energy cost of ambulation and resultant hypoactivity."
7488,"肌营养不良时，体力活动受限主要是由肌肉耐力因素引起的，比氧运输系统的缺陷更重要（Bar- Or, 1986)。","In MD, limitations on physical capacities are due to muscle endurance factors rather than due to deficiencies in the oxygentransport system (Bar-Or, 1986)."
7488,患杜兴型肌营养不良儿童的平均无氧功率减低，低于平均值2-4个标准差以上（Bar-〇r，1983)，“代谢指数” (最大无氧功率与最大有氧功率之比）下降（Bar-Or，1983)。,"Mean anaerobic power is reduced by as much as 2 —4 SD below the mean (Bar-Or, 1983) and there is a reduced 'metabolic index' (ratio of peak anaerobic to peak aerobic power) (Bar-Or, 1983) in children with Duchenne's M D."
7489,蹬起靠墙成倒立姿势，脚跟与墙壁接触，身体略微成弓形。,"Kick up into a handstand against a wall.Your body should be slightly arched, with your heels in contact with the wall."
7489,双手与肩同宽，距离墙根约15-25厘米，手臂伸直。,"Your hands should be six to ten inches from the base of the wall, and shoulder width apart."
7489,逐渐抬起一只手的手掌，将重心慢慢转移到身体的另一侧，另一侧的手掌会承受越来越多的体重。,"Keep your arms straight.Now gradually press off with one palm, so that your center of gravity shifts towards the other side of the body.This will put more of your bodyweight through the opposite palm."
7489,继续这种转移过程（持续几秒钟），直到略微抬起的手掌上只剩下几千克的压力。,Continue this transition over the course of a few seconds until there are only a few pounds of pressure left in the pushing palm.
7489,现在轻轻抬起这只手，使之离开地面，并将它伸向远处以保持平衡。,"Now gently lift that palm away from the floor altogether, and hold it away from your body for balance."
7489,现在，你就是在以一只伸直的手臂支撑整个身体。,You will now be supporting yourself on one straight arm.
7489,这是单臂半倒立撑的起始姿势（图121）。,This is the start position of the half one-arm handstand pushup (fig. 121).
7490,摆出半俯卧撑最高点时的姿势，即将篮球放在髋部下方（见第四式）。,"Get into the half pushup top position, with a basketball located below your hips, as described in Step 4."
7490,将一只手撑在胸部下方的地面上，手臂伸直，另一只手背在身后。,Place one hand on the floor beneath your breastbone with your arm straight and your other hand in the small of your back.
7490,这是单臂半俯卧撑的起始姿势（图15）。,This is the start position of the half one-arm pushup (fig. 15).
7491,单手抓住高过头顶的横杆，要选择对你来说最容易发力的抓握姿势——有人是正握，有人是侧握或反握，但对大多数人来说，在吊环上做该动作可能最容易。,"Grab an overhead bar with one hand, using your strongest gripping position.For some people, this will be an overhand grip; for others, side-on or underhand.Using a hanging ring is probably ideal for most people."
7491,另一只手可随意放置，舒服即可。我的大多数学生喜欢将手臂悬于空中，我个人更喜欢像做单臂俯卧撑那样将手置于身后。,"Place your other arm anywhere that seems comfortable; most of my students like to leave it out to the side in mid-air, but I personally prefer placing it in the small of my back, as for one-arm pushups."
7491,哪种姿势都可以，只要不妨碍你做动作就好。,Any position that doesn’t interfere is fine.
7491,将要锻炼的那只手臂（可以通过跳、蹬腿或借助一把椅子等方式）置于半弯曲状态，肘部弯曲成直角，即上臂与地面平行。,"Set yourself (by jumping, kipping, using a chair, etc.) so that your lifting arm is bent halfway.The elbow should be at a right angle, with your upper arm parallel to the ground."
7491,双脚离地，脚踝交叠在一起并置于身后。,Your feet should be clear of the floor and looped behind you as for previous steps.
7491,发力的那侧肩部应该收紧，同时全身都要绷紧。,"The shoulder of your lifting arm should be tightly braced, and your whole body flexed."
7491,这是单臂半引体向上的起始姿势（图55）。,This is the start position of 1/2 one-arm pullups (fig. 55).
7491,弯曲肘部，夹起肩部，平缓地将自己拉起来，直到下巴高过横杆。,Bend at the elbow and shoulder and smoothly pull your body up until your chin is over the height of the bar.
7491,这是该动作的结束姿势（图56）。,This is the finish position (fig. 56).
7491,在顶部暂停一下，然后慢慢放低身体，回到起始姿势。,"Pause at the top, before slowly lowering yourself back down to the start position."
7492,蹬起靠墙成倒立姿势，向一侧略微倾斜，直到仅用单臂支撑身体的全部重量，就像单臂半倒立撑（第八式）中那样。,"Kick up into a handstand against a wall, and lean out to the side until you are supporting yourself with one arm, as in half one-arm handstand pushups (Step 8)."
7492,脚跟与墙壁接触，身体略微成弓形。,Keep your body gently arched with the heels against the wall.
7492,这是单臂倒立撑的起始姿势（图125）。,This is the start position of the one-arm handstand pushup (fig. 125).
7493,跪在地板上，一只手撑在你前方的地面上。,"Kneel on the floor, with one palm out on the ground directly in front of you."
7493,双腿向后蹬直，用脚趾支撑身体。,"Stretch your legs out behind you, until they are straight and supported by the toes."
7493,脊柱与髋部成一条直线，支撑身体的手臂在胸部下方伸直——不要在身体侧面或是靠前的位置。,"Keep the spine and hips aligned, and shift your bodyweight so that your supporting arm goes straight down below your chest—not out to the side or in front of you."
7493,稳定之后，把不起支撑作用的那只手背在身后。,"Once you are stable, place your non-supporting hand in the small of your back."
7493,这是单臂俯卧撑的起始姿势（图19）。,This is the start position of the one-arm pushup (fig. 19).
7494,抓握毛巾的那只手的位置越低，就越难提供助力。,"The further your hand is down the towel or rope you use, the harder it is to provide assistance."
7494,如果你不能做5次反复，那就升高抓握毛巾的位置，使其更靠近横杆一点儿。,"If you have trouble getting five reps on this exercise, hold the towel nearer up to the bar."
7494,等你变得更强以后，就可以降低抓握毛巾的位置。,"As you get stronger, hold the towel lower down."
7494,最后，你会感觉到自己是在向下“推”毛巾，而不是“拉”毛巾，这样你的身体就能在单臂辅助引体向上中变得越来越强，并为练习最终式——单臂引体向上——做好准备。,"Eventually you will feel you are pushing down on the towel, rather than pulling.This is a great way to advance on assisted one-arm pullups and eventually prepare yourself for the Master Step—one-arm pullups."
7495,向上跳起，单手以最容易发力的抓握姿势牢牢抓住高过头顶的横杆。,Jump up and firmly squeeze an overhead bar using your strongest gripping position.
7495,双腿离地，双膝弯曲，脚踝交叠在一起并置于身后，以防止腿部摆动。,"Your legs should be clear of the floor, with your knees bent so that your feet are behind you.Loop one ankle over the other to keep your legs still."
7495,另一只手可随意放置，舒服即可。（你在练习第八式单臂半引体向上时，应该已经找到了最舒服的姿势）。,"Place your non-lifting arm in a comfortable position (you should have found your ideal position when you learned Step 8, half one-arm pullups)."
7495,发力的肩部要收紧，同时全身绷紧准备做动作。,"Your working shoulder should be set tight, and your body tensed for action."
7495,你将要做的可是高级力量技巧，所以你需要在心理上也做好准备。,"You are about to perform an advanced strength feat, and this should be reflected in your psychology."
7495,发力那只手的手臂几乎伸直，但略有弯曲以减少关节的压力。,"Your working arm should be virtually straight, with just a little kink in it to take the stress of the joints."
7495,这是单臂引体向上的起始姿势（图59）。,This is the start position of the one-arm pullup (fig. 59).
7495,弯曲肘部，夹起肩部，将自己拉起来，直到下巴高过横杆。在整个动作过程中，尽量少用惯性。,Bend at the elbow and shoulder and pull your body up with as little momentum as possible until your chin is over the height of the bar.
7495,这是该动作的结束姿势（图60）。,This is the finish position (fig. 60).
7495,暂停一下，再缓慢地放低身体，回到起始姿势。,"Pause, and smoothly lower yourself back down to the start position."
7495,在最低处暂停一下，再重复动作——如果你行的话！,Pause at the bottom and repeat--if you can!
7496,流感病毒就像一个想要赖在你的沙发椅上借宿的高中同学一样，会使你的生活混乱一些日子后扬长而去。,"The flu virus, like a high school friend who wants to crash on your couch, makes your life miserable for a few days and then hightails it out of there."
7496,至于其他像传染性单核细胞增多症，会使你非常累，但你需要更长时间经历其发展过程。,"Others, like mononucleosis, which makes you extremely tired, take a little longer to run their course."
7496,还有一些如疱疹病毒，它们会想办法存活下来并且安静地待在你的身体里，但是会偶尔突然发作（就像伤风发热时的疱疹来来去去的反复）。,"Still others, like the herpesvirus, figure out a way to survive and be quiet within the body but then flare up occasionally (cold sores come and go)."
7497,其他控制内在效度威胁的方式包括安慰剂、单盲及双盲设计。,Other ways of controlling threats to internal validity include placebos and blind and doubleblind setups.
7497,安慰剂（placebo)是用来评估观察到的效果是来自实验处理或心理效果。,A placebo is used to evaluate whether the observed effect is produced by the treatment or is a psychological effect.
7497,通常控制条件是研究对象接受到实验者关注与互动程度一样，只不过采取的实验处理和依变项的表现无关。,"Frequently, a control condition is used in which participants receive the same attention from and interaction with the experimenter, but the treatment administered does not relate to performance on the dependent variable."
7498,在单腿半深蹲过程中，直立，只靠一条腿站立，另一条腿向前抬起，伸直或略微弯曲，抬起的脚大约处在另一条腿大腿的高度上，双手向胸前伸出。,"In the 1/2 one-leg squats, stand straight, with one foot flat on the floor, and the other foot up in the air in front of you.Your elevated foot should be at about the level of your opposite thigh, and the leg should be straight, or nearly so.Place your hands out in front of your chest."
7498,弯曲髋部和支撑腿的膝盖，直到膝关节几乎弯曲成90°，即大腿几乎与地面平行。,"Bend the hip and knee of the leg which is supporting your bodyweight, until the knee is bent about ninety degrees.This will put your thigh approximately parallel with the floor."
7498,在此过程中，抬起的那条腿应该始终在空中。,"At this point, your raised foot should still be some way off the ground."
7498,暂停一会，然后单腿发力把自己推回到起始姿势。,"Pause for a moment under tension, before driving yourself up using the power of your single leg."
7498,在动作过程中，背部始终要保持平直，而且支撑腿的脚跟始终不能抬离地面。,Keep the back flat and the heel of your supporting leg on the floor at all times.
7499,把篮球放在要练的那条腿的外侧。,Place a basketball to the side of the foot of the leg you are planning to work.
7499,直立，一只脚平放在地面上，另一只脚在你前方抬起——同单腿半深蹲（第八式）的起始姿势。,"Stand up straight with one foot flat on the floor, and the other foot up in the air in front of you, as for half one-leg squats (Step 8)."
7499,抬起那条腿的同侧手臂向前伸出，另一只手臂自然垂于体侧（图37）。,"Place the arm corresponding to your raised leg out in front of you, and let your other arm hang by your side (fig. 37)."
7499,然后弯曲髋部和支撑腿的膝盖，直到大腿后侧紧贴小腿，无法继续下蹲为止。,"Bend at the hip and knee of your supporting leg until your hamstrings meet your calf, and you cannot go any further."
7499,此时，你的手应该稳稳地放在篮球上，这是单腿辅助深蹲的最低点（图38）。,Place your hand firmly on the basketball.This is the finish position of the assisted one-leg squats (fig. 38).
7499,起身时主要依靠腿部力量，但你也要用手按压篮球，以便在反向动作的最初阶段借力。,"Return to the standing position using mostly leg strength, but press down on the basketball to help you over the first few inches."
7499,注意，在动作过程中，支撑腿的脚跟始终不能抬离地面。,Keep the heels flat.
7500,单腿深蹲时，直立，抬起一条腿，直到脚大约与髋部等高，腿要尽量伸直，双臂在胸前前伸。,"In the one-leg squats, stand tall.Raise one foot in the air, until it is approximately level with your hips.Keep your elevated leg as straight as possible."
7500,如果你在之前几式上已经花了大量时间，那么这些对你来说不会太难。,This will not be too difficult provided you have spent time mastering the previous steps.Place the arms directly out in front of your chest.
7500,这是该动作的起始姿势。,This is the start position.
7500,然后弯曲髋部与支撑腿的膝盖。,Bend at the knee and hip of the supporting leg.
7500,你应该有控制地放低身体，不要一下蹲到底。,Control your descent; do not allow yourself to just drop.
7500,缓慢地下蹲，直到支撑腿的大腿后侧紧贴小腿，无法继续下蹲为止。,"Descend smoothly, until the back of the thigh of your supporting leg compresses against the calf and you cannot go any further."
7500,此时，你的腹部应该与支撑腿的大腿紧贴在一起。,Your torso will also be tight against your working thigh.
7500,这是该动作的最低点。,This is the finish position.
7500,在紧张状态下，暂停一下，然后单腿发力把自己推回到起始姿势。,"Pause for a count of one, under tension.Push yourself back up to the start position using leg strength alone."
7500,注意，千万不要借助惯性起身。,There should be no momentum at all.
7500,在动作过程中，背部始终挺直，抬起的腿始终离地，而支撑腿则应稳稳地踩在地上。,"Retain a straight back, hold the elevated foot off the ground, and keep the heels firmly on the floor."
7500,到达动作最高点时暂停一下，然后再下蹲。,"Pause at the top, and repeat."
7501,并非只有“胆结石”和“滚石”乐队这两种“石”会影响我们的生活。,Gallstones and the Rolling Stones aren't the only stones that can change your life.
7501,还有一种“石”会让你痛得昏过去，像橄榄球运动员被对手在肚子上猛顶一下一样。,The other is the one that'll make you keel over like a rugby player who's been kneed in the groin.
7501,尿液含水量过少，会形成小晶体，接着晶体会聚集形成结石，即肾结石。患者在排尿时，背部下侧和腰侧都会剧痛。,Kidney stones form when urine becomes so concentrated that small crystals and then stones are formed—creating intense pain in your lower back and side and when you urinate.
7501,肾结石的主要防治方法是把自己的身体当成一个空的游泳池，将池子装满水，让水冲出来，通过用水稀释结晶体的方法来防止其进一步形成结石。,"The main method of prevention is to treat your body like an empty swimming pool and flood it with water to flush it out, which inhibits the formation of the crystals by diluting them with water."
7502,食道与胃部的相接角度很小，以减轻反胃现象，但是一旦相接处被打开（交角增大），我们就会由于胃食道反流而产生胃部灼热和消化不良。,"The esophagus makes a sharp angle as it enters the stomach to reduce this regurgitation, but if the junction is opened (the angle is reduced), we get burning and indigestion from GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disorder)."
7502,胆囊储存着胆汁，当食物团通过胃部的时候，胆汁就会分泌到小肠里。,"The gallbladder stores bile, which can be secreted into the small bowel once the food bolus has passed through the stomach."
7502,有时，储存的胆汁会硬化，形成胆结石，人会感觉很疼。,The stored bile can harden and form painful gallstones.
7503,弹震式俯卧撑也就是众所周知的击掌俯卧撑，是一种爆发力练习。,"The plyometric pushup is also known as clapping pushup.This is the standard pushup, but done explosively."
7503,动作过程中身体始终要挺直，快速下降到最低点后再用力将自己推起，当动作达到最高点时让手掌暂时离地。,"Keeping the body ramrod stiff, descend quickly into the bottom position before driving up so hard that the hands leave the floor briefly."
7503,在半空中快速击掌，然后让手掌着地，反复练习。,"While in mid-air, clap the hands together in the split second before your palms meet the floor again and then repeat the exercise."
7503,你将自己推起的力量越大，身体就抬得越高，用于击掌的时间也就越长。,"The more powerfully you push, the further away you’ll be able to get from the floor, and the more times you’ll be able to quickly clap before coming back down."
7503,许多人都能击掌三次，甚至四次。,Many guys are able to do triple or even quadruple claps.
7503,最难的是单臂击掌俯卧撑，只用单臂推起身体，然后击掌。,"An extremely difficult version is the one-arm clapping pushup, where you push up with just one arm before clapping."
7503,击掌俯卧撑可以提高你的速度，你可以将其用作健身计划的补充，偶尔为之。,"Clapping pushups add speed and are an excellent addition to your routine, once in a while."
7503,但是击掌俯卧撑很容易让训练者受伤，所以你不要急于尝试这个动作——至少要等到攻克了偏重俯卧撑之后。,"They can lead to injury.However, so work into them slowly and don’t even attempt them until you have at least mastered uneven pushups."
7504,在健身房里，练习弹震式跳跃的健身者通常会使用稳固的平台来练习“跳箱子”——从固定站姿开始，跳到一个盒子上。,"Plyometric trainees in gyms often use sturdy platforms for box jumps, which involve hopping up onto a box from a fixed stance."
7504,但事实上，弹震式跳跃不需要任何器械。,You really don’t require any equipment to do plyometric jumping though.
7504,在圣昆汀监狱，我的第一个室友教给我一种运动——立定跳远，这是他从军时学到的。,In San Quentin my first cellmate taught me a technique he learned in the military called dead leaps.
7504,只需双脚并拢，快速下蹲，然后尽力向远处跳，落地时双脚依然保持并拢，而且身体不能向前倾倒，否则就算失败。,"Just place your feet together and dip quickly, before jumping forward as far as you can.Keep your feet together as you land, and try not to topple forwards or the jump doesn’t count."
7504,这个动作做起来比看上去要难，因为通常情况下，我们都要跑一段——至少跑一两步，然后才会起跳。,"This is actually harder than it looks, as people normally take a run-up—at least a step or two—before they jump anywhere."
7504,用跳跃练习增强爆发力时，要强调力量，而不是次数。热身之后，反复做2-3组，每组4-6次，就足够了。,"When jumping for explosiveness, emphasize power rather than high reps. Warm up, and repeat the jumps for two or three sets of four to six reps—that’s all you need."
7505,倒立臂屈伸是经典的上身力量特技，深受旧时大力士的喜爱，因为它既可以展示极好的平衡能力与协调性，又可以展示强悍的力量。,The tiger bend is a classic upper body feat favored by the old-time strongmen because it displays balance and coordination as well as enormous strength.
7505,先成自由倒立姿势，不要凭借墙。,"Get into a free handstand, away from the wall."
7505,放低身体，直到前臂完全贴在地上，保持一会儿。,"Drop down flat onto your forearms, and hold for a moment."
7505,这时，你的双臂就像大型猫科动物的前爪一样，因此该动作也被称作“虎立”（见下图）。,In this position your arms will resemble the forepaws of a big cat—hence the name (see photo next page).
7506,应该借助肌肉力量完成引体向上，而不是惯性。,Pullup movements should be performed using muscle strength rather than momentum.
7506,但是肌肉缺乏力量的人在做引体向上时会不自觉地向上抬膝盖，以获得惯性来完成动作。这种作弊技巧有专门的名称——蹬腿。,"But if you lack the strength, you’ll tend to kick upwards with your knees to give you the momentum to complete a rep. There’s a special name for this kind of cheating technique—kipping."
7507,蹬箱选择一个 40 厘米或者 50 厘米高的箱子。,Box Step-up Use a 16- or 20-inch box.
7507,面对箱子站立，注意使用核心力量蹬上箱子。,"Face the box, engage your core, and step up onto the box."
7507,保证双脚向前——不要向鸭子一样外八字。,"Make sure your foot remains neutral throughout—don’t allow it to spin outward, ducklike."
7507,使用臀部发力蹬上，然后回到地面。,"Use your hips to drive yourself up on top of the box, and return."
7508,实验室试验 -等动单关节试验：跨越单个关节（如膝关节或肘关节）的动作可以采用控制动作的力（动力性）或动作的速度（等动的）的测功器来测试。,LABORATORY TESTS - Isokinetic monoarticular tests: Movement across a single joint (e.g.knee or elbow) can be measured with ergometers which control the force of movement (dynamic) or the velocity of movement (isokinetic).
7508,儿童的数据很少。,Few data are available for children.
7508,等动试验的目的是测量最大力矩和平均功率。,The aim of isokinetic testing is the measurement of peak torque and mean power.
7509,20s等动自行车功率计试验。,20-s isokinetic cycling test.
7509,前面提到过，只有外在负荷接近活动肌肉的能力时，才能测试到真正的最大功率输出，这时的肌肉是在它们最佳的速度下活动。,"As mentioned earlier, true maximal power output can only be measured if the external load is closely matched to the capability of the active muscles so that they are functioning at their optimal velocity."
7509,如在摩擦力负荷的功率自行车上（温盖特试验或力-速度试验）或在冲刺跑（跑楼梯）时所达到的那样，在自由加速度或减速度中，这些条件是很难满足的。,"In freely accelerating or decelerating velocity, as achieved in friction—loaded cycle ergometers (Wingate test or force-velocity test) or running sprints (staircase running) these conditions are hard to fulfil."
7510,"自从正确追踪有生物学活性激素的较新的第三代LH检测法得到应用以来，人们发现在青春发育期的所有阶段都有促黄体生成激素（luteinizing hormone, LH)的脉冲释放。","Pulsatile release of luteinizing hormone (LH) is found at all stages of pubertal development, especially since the newer, third generation LH assays that faithfully track biologically active hormone have been used."
7510,应用这些测定技术，真正的脉冲性LH(和FSH)的释放能够在青春期前(阶段I)和青春期早期的儿童中测试到。,With these assays truly pulsatile LH (and FSH) release can be detected in prepubertal (stage I) as well as early pubertal children.
7510,这样，可以将激素分泌正常与患永久性低促性腺激素性腺机能低下症（permanent hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism)的儿童 加以区别（Haavisto et al.，1990)。,"Such secretion could be distinguished from that in children with permanent hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism (Haavisto et al., 1990)."
7511,相反，在十几岁的运动员中，特别是女孩中铁蛋白水平下降的出现频率高得令人惊奇。,"Conversely, the frequency of depressed ferritin levels among teenage athletes, most particularly females, is surprisingly high."
7511,"正如对高中运动员的研究表明 (表19.1),有1/3-1/2的女孩有低铁蛋白血症。","As outlined in Table 19 .1, studies of high school athletes indicate that approximately one-third to one-half of girls can be expected to have hypoferritinaemia."
7511,对男性运动员的铁状况的检测尚不普遍，但已有的数据表明，低铁蛋白水平的发生率较低（0-17%),"Iron status in males has not been frequently assessed, but available data indicate a much lower incidence of low ferritin levels (0 -17% )."
7512,当然，为青少年糖尿病患者选择运动活动时，需要了解健康儿童对运动的适应过程以及患糖尿病时发生的变化。,"However, the choice of sporting activities for the young diabetic requires an understanding of the adaptation to physical activity in the healthy child and the changes caused by diabetes."
7512,为使糖尿病儿童达到非糖尿病患者同样的运动水平，使肌肉活动在葡萄糖同化方面最有利，必须进行充分的胰岛素治疗。,Adequate insulin therapy is required to allow the full benefit of muscular activity on glucose assimilation for the child to reach the same level of physical performance as the non-diabetic.
7512,如果代谢控制不足，运动能引起严重低血糖发作或产生高血糖并 导致酮酸中毒。,"In the case of insufficient metabolic control, exercise can provoke severe hypoglycaemia episodes or produce hyperglycaemia and lead to ketoacidosis."
7513,对于贝类动物过敏的人同时也会对医学检测的某些染色剂过敏 。,People allergic to shellfish are also allergic to some dyes used in medical testing.
7513,这两者都含有的有害物质是碘。,The harmful ingredient: the iodine found in both.
7513,这也就是为什么医生会在就诊中问你是否对贝类过敏。,That's why doctors often ask this question on screening questionnaires.
7514,如果这两个计划中有任何你觉得困难的动作，那么请调整动作难度，保证可以安全完成练习。,"If any exercise in either program feels out of reach, scale back the movement to something you can safely perform."
7514,一个很好的办法是降低练习的强度，如减小阻力、减少总次数或者减少每组的重复次数。,A good way to do this is to reduce the intensity of the exercise by lowering the resistance or else dropping down the number of reps or the amount of time for which each exercise is to be repeated.
7514,举例来说，引体向上的推荐代替动作是仰卧吊环划船：将一副体操吊环调整至接近地面的高度，仰卧并拉起身体视为完成一次动作。,"For example, a recommended substitution for a pull-up is the supine ring row: Using a pair of gymnastics rings lowered to near the floor, lie on your back and pull yourself up for a count of 1."
7515,不同于哲学论证，运动表现领域的问题至少是潜在的符合实验研究方法的。,"Unlike the philosophical arguments, the question in the realm of athletic performance is at least potentially amenable to an experimental approach."
7515,这本书后面的部分研究了这些调査。,The latter pages of this book examine some of these investigations.
7515,即使天赋是基本的推动力，随着机体衰老对运动表现的影响，运动员能够使用认知策略来征服或克服生物因素限制，由他们自己来直接控制吗？,Even when nature is clearly a basic driving force—as in the effects of aging on performance—can athletes use cognitive strategies to subdue or overcome limits placed by biological factors that are out of their direct control?
7515,这样做是安全的吗？,Is it safe to do so?
7515,我现在认为最后三章中有8个问题没有任何明确答案。,I now count eight questions in the last three paragraphs without any obvious answers.
7516,对于一些人来说，我也许像个偏执狂，但是总有人能理解我探寻 跑步艺术的热情和不断进取的精神，布菜恩• 麦肯齐就是其中之一。,"To some people I might seem obsessive, but there are others who share my passion for understanding the act of running and for constantly seeking to improve.Brian MacKenzie is one of these."
7516,对于全球新一代参与混合健身和混合健身耐力训练的跑者，麦肯齐可谓是天赐之人。,"For a new generation of runners around the world who have taken up CrossFit and CrossFit Endurance, Brian has been a godsend."
7516,麦肯齐对于跑步训练知识的渴求是从他自己的“逐龙” 之旅开始的，这条龙正是长距离耐力比赛。,"His hunger for knowledge has been insatiable since he himself started “chasing the dragon,” as he likes to call the beast that is long-course endurance racing."
7516,不论是参加超级马拉松比赛还是铁人三项比赛，麦肯齐一直热衷于不断更新训练计划，包括调整饮食计划、选择极简跑鞋和采用力量调节训练提高运动水平并避免受伤。,"Whether he’s competing in ultramarathons or Ironman triathlons, Brian has feverishly tinkered with the many variables that go into the craft, from diet to minimalist footwear to the use of strength conditioning as a way both to improve performance and to ward off injury."
7517,平躺在地上，弯曲膝盖，把脚拉向臀部，直到脚跟与臀部相距约15到20厘米。,"Lie with your back on the floor.Draw your feet in, bending the knees until your heels are approximately six to eight inches from your glutes."
7517,双脚与肩同宽或略窄，双手撑在头部两侧的地板上，手指指向脚，两肘指向天花板。,"The feet should be shoulder width apart or slightly closer.Place the hands alongside the head, with the palms flat on the floor and your fingers pointing towards your toes.Your elbows should be angled towards the ceiling at this point."
7517,尽力抬起髋部，使身体离地。,"Now push the hips as high as you can, lifting the body from the floor."
7517,手臂与腿继续用力推，直到背部形成优美的弧形，髋部高高抬起。,"Continue pushing through your arms and legs until your back is well arched, and your hips are high."
7517,头向下仰，头顶指向地板，这是“桥式”。,"The head should be tilted down, with the crown of your skull pointing towards the floor.This is a bridge hold."
7517,保持这个姿势一会儿，然后弯曲手臂与双腿，直到头部轻轻接触地板。,"Retain this position momentarily, before bending at the arms and legs until the top of your skull very gently touches the floor."
7517,这是该动作的起始姿势（图89）。,This is the start position of head bridges (fig. 89).
7517,再次暂停一会，然后将背部向上推起成“桥式”。这是该顶桥的结束姿势（图90）。,"Pause again briefly, before pushing yourself back up to the bridge (fig. 90).This is the finish position."
7517,运动过程中要小心，以免撞到头部。,"Go carefully, so that you don’t bang your head."
7517,在整个练习组中，背部始终要保持弧形，并且尽量正常呼吸。,"Maintain the deep arch in the back all the way throughout the set, breathing as normally as possible all the way through."
7517,完成训练目标之后，慢慢地放低肩部、背部和髋部，直至整个身体接触地面。,"When you have finished all your reps, smoothly lower your shoulders, back and hips to the floor."
7518,你实际上有两种类型的汗腺，它们能产生看起来和摸起来类似汗液的物质。,You actually have two types of sweat glands that produce stuff that looks and feels like sweat.
7518,大多数分泌出来的液体都对身体有益，并能起到排出身体毒素的作用。,Most of this secreted fluid serves a beneficial purpose by helping to flush toxins out of your body.
7518,这两种汗腺中只有顶质分泌腺才分泌出臭味，这种气味成为我们的身份识别的一部分，它能吸引异性，还会让你为逃避汗臭宁愿选择在健身馆另一头的脚踏车。,"It's only the apocrine sweat gland that secretes the odor—the smell that produces part of our identity, attracts mates, and makes you pick the treadmill at the other end of the gym."
7519,人们已经了解清楚的是，儿童在生长和发育时他们的运动能力提高了。,It is clear that as children grow and develop their performance capabilities improve.
7519,人们还不十分了解的是，这种提高在多大程度上是由身材大小的增大还是由相关组织结构的性质及其分布的变化引起的。,What is less clear is the extent to which these improvements are attributable to increases in size or to qualitative changes in the distribution and properties of associated tissues and structures.
7519,为了评估这种性质上的变化，身材大小的差异必须分割出来，这种分割称为定标。,"To assess qualitative changes, differences in size have to be partitioned out and this partitioning is called scaling (Schmidt-Nielsen, 1984)."
7520,几年来，人们依据计算步数或动作的原理开发了若干电子装置。,Over the years several electronic devices have been developed based on the principle of counting steps or motion.
7520,虽然其中某些装置比其他的可靠，但是它们都没有考虑到动作的强度问题，因此不能很好地反映各种用力和能量消耗量。,"Although some of them are more reliable than others, they all do not take intensity of the movement into account and thus do not reflect the forces and energy turnover well."
7520,这类动作计数器给出的是动作的总数，而不能区别动作的强度。,These types of movement counters yield a total number of movements and do not make distinctions between the intensity of the movements.
7520,此外，特殊的动作如骑车，计数器就无法使用。,
7521,各种便携式加速度测量仪 (accelerometer)能够较好反映每天的体力活动情况，加速度测量仪也叫动作记录仪 (actometer)。,A better reflection of daily physical activity is given by portable accelerometers also called actometer.
7521,当一个人移动时，肢体和身体都在加速和减速。,"When a person moves, the limbs and body are accelerated and decelerated."
7521,在呼吸仓内用测力台进行的检测表明，加速度测量仪的结果与能量消耗量非常一致。,Measurements with force—platform in a respiration chamber showed good agreement with energy turnover.
7522,"与热习服相反，人体对冷环境的适应是有限的（Young, 1988)，适应主要表现在增加暴露在外的肢体皮肤的血流量(Krog et al., 1960)。","In contrast to heat acclimation, there appears to be only limited adaptation to cold (Young, 1988), which is mainly characterized by an elevated skin blood flow to frequently exposed extremities (Krog et al., i960)."
7522,这种适应能够帮助成年人预防冻疮，但对儿童是否有效还没 有研究过。,"This adaptation, which may help to prevent frostbite, has been demonstrated in adults but has not been studied in children."
7522,"增强身体素质可以降低发生热损伤的危险，但对于预防冷损伤并无作用 (Adams & Heberling, 1958)。","Elevated physical fitness reduces the risk of heat injuries but does not appear to prevent cold injuries (Adams & Heberling, 1958)."
7522,确实，训练有素的人通常皮下脂肪层很薄，因此更容易发生冷损伤。,"Indeed, well-trained individuals are usually characterized by a thin layer of subcutaneous fat and may therefore be more susceptible to cold injuries."
7523,躺在地上，双手叠放在腹部。,"Lie on your back, with your legs stretched out and your hands crossed on your stomach."
7523,膝盖弯曲，将双脚拉向臀部，直到胫骨与地面接近垂直，此时脚跟距离臀部约15一20厘米，脚掌平放在地上。,"Draw your feet in, bending the knees until your shins are nearly parallel to the ground and your feet your feet are flat on the floor."
7523,双脚与肩同宽或略窄，依个人舒适度而定。,"The feet should be shoulder width apart or a little less, depending upon your frame.Your heels will be around six to eight inches from your buttocks."
7523,这是短桥的起始姿势（图83）。,This is the start position of short bridges (fig.83).
7523,然后双脚用力下压，身体向上拱起，使髋部和背部离开地面，直到仅以双肩和双脚支撑整个身体。,"Press down through the feet, lifting the hips and back clear of the ground until only the shoulders and feet are supporting the bodyweight."
7523,此时，大腿和躯干应成一条直线，髋部不要下沉。,"At this point, your thighs, trunk and torso should form a straight line, with no sagging of the hips."
7523,这是结束姿势（图84）。,This is the finish position (fig. 84).
7523,暂停一会，然后做反向动作，缓缓地放低身体，直到回到起始姿势，如此重复。,"Pause in the top position for a moment, before reversing the motion, lowering your body back to the start position."
7523,身体撑起时呼气身体放低时吸气。,"Repeat the exercise for your target repetitions, exhaling as you go up, inhaling on the way down."
7524,一场风暴会中断电力供应长达数分钟或更久，同样地，一次中风也会造成或轻或重的伤害。,"Just like a storm can knock out power for a few minutes or indefinitely, a stroke can do the same, and have varying degrees of damage."
7524,比如，短暂性局部缺血 (T1A)是一种轻度中风，在这种情况下， 动脉血管堵塞只会持续很短时间。,"A transient ischemic attack (TIA), for example, is a ministroke in which the arteries are blocked only a short time."
7524,TIA实际上是真正中风发作的前兆（虽然T1A 较易治愈）。,A TIA is actually a precursor to a full stroke (though it's more easily treated).
7525,"对数线性模式(loglinear models) 通常用在分析多因子列联表上,将相对次数转换成对数的形式后相加,与单因子变异数分析中的平方和类似。","Loglinear models are used to analyze multivariate contingency tables.Relative frequencies are transformed to logarithms, which are additive and similar to the sum of squares in ANOVA."
7525,并透过检定的方式来检定主要效果和交互作用的效果。,Main effects and interactions can be tested for significance.
7525,并以对数比的基础所建构的罗吉斯回归方程式来预测每笔资料的机率(又称逻辑回归）。,The probability of membership in a particular category can be predicted as a function of membership in other categories using a logistic regression equation based on the logarithmic odds of member­ ship (called a logit).
7526,对训练作用的研究通常是纵向的并且需要反复的测试。,Studies which investigate the effects of training are usually longitudinal and have a repeated measures design.
7526,当研究对象是儿童和青少年时，生长和发育对运动能力的影响必须予以分开，这样才能对训练的影响进行评估。,"When children and adolescents are the subjects, the effects of growth and development on performance have to be disentangled so that the effects of training can be assessed."
7526,"有一种技术可以满足这一需求，它就是多级回归模型的方法（multilevel regression modelling procedure) (Goldstein, 1986)。它曾经被用来研究优秀正常儿童和青少年运动员的心肺功能的变化（Baxter-Jones et al., 1993)，所采用的是多级模型项目 (Multilevel Models Project) ML3的分析程序（Prosser et al., 1990)。","A technique has been developed to meet this challenge.It is a multilevel regression modelling procedure (Goldstein, 1986) and it has been used to explore changes in cardiopulmonary function in élite standard child and adolescent athletes (Baxter-Jones et al., 1993) via the analysis program Multilevel Models Project ML3 (Prosser et ah, 1990)."
7527,它们似乎降低血液中甘油三酯水平（高水平导致动脉斑块形成），稳定心跳（重新调整不规则节律），使血小板减少粘性（减少凝血），并可能降低血压（如果你不喜欢鱼或鱼油，DHA支持）。一天一次吃一次鱼会降低心脏病发作的风险，其中一半的最好的鱼（那些最少的汞和多氯联苯[多氯联苯]）是野生的，钓到鲑鱼（几乎所有罐装的SA）。健康的鲑鱼，鲶鱼，鲽鱼（脚掌），和白鲑。,"They appear to reduce triglyceride levels in the blood (high levels cause plaque buildup in the arteries), stabilize the heartbeat (re¬ducing irregular rhythms), make platelets less sticky (reducing clotting), and may bring down blood pressure as well (If you do not like fish or fish oils, DHA supple¬ments [600 milligrams a day] or echium oil may do the same thing.) Some studies have suggested that eating fish once a week cuts your risk of heart attack in half.The best fish (those with the least mercury and PCBs [polychlorinated biphenyl]) are wild, line-caught salmon (almost all canned salmon is wild, healthful salmon), mahi mahi，catfish, flounder (sole), and whitefish."
7528,多元回归包含一个依变项（通常是某类别的效标）以及两个以上的预测变项（自变项）。,Multiple regression involves one dependent variable (usually a criterion of some sort) and two or more predictor variables (independent variables).
7528,使用超过一个预测变项时，通常会增加预测的准确性，这应该是不证自明的。,The use of more than one predictor variable usually increases the accuracy of prediction.
7528,如果欲预测PGA巡回赛的平均分数，应采用多种显示球员技术的方式（如：开球距离、上果岭成功率和平均推杆数）而非单一方式，这样可以获得更准确的预测。,"This should be self-evident.If you wished to predict scoring average on the PGA Tour, you would expect to get a more accurate prediction by using several skill results (e.g., driving distance, greens in regulation, putts per round) rather than by using only one."
7529,俄式转体就是坐在罗马椅上，或者采用其他姿势，只要能让躯干在没有任何支撑的情况下向后仰就好。,"When doing Russian Twists, get into a Roman chair, or any position where your torso is horizontal and free of support."
7529,双手在身体前方拿着一个重物——健身房里的很多家伙都使用20千克重的杠铃片，但在监狱里大家喜欢厚厚的书或是水瓶——然后慢慢向后倾斜躯干。,"Grab a weight—in the gym a lot of guys use a 45 lbs.plate, but in the pen we liked a heavy book or water bottle in each hand—and incline your trunk slightly."
7529,伸直手臂，然后从左向右扭转身体双臂的动作幅度无需过大——大约从10点钟的位置移到2点钟的位置，同时腰部也要随之转动。,"Hold the weight at arm’s length, and twist from left to right.Your arms (and therefore your waist rotation) only need to go from about the ten o’ clock to the two o’ clock position."
7529,如果你腹部两侧的肌肉开始疯狂燃烧，那就说明你的动作是对的。,"You’ll know when you get this movement right, because the muscles to the sides of your abs will start to burn like crazy."
7529,你很难增加该练习的难度，但这是一种很有趣的变式，可以偶尔将其加入你的训练计划。,"It’s hard to make this exercise progressive, but it’s a fun variation to throw into your workouts once in a while."
7530,这只左耳只有外部软骨，骨头受伤，就造成了花菜耳（因重复性重右而肿胀变形的耳朵）。,"This left ear has external cartilage without bone that has been injured, causing cauliflower ear."
7530,声波进人耳朵，震动鼓膜和三个相连的小骨。,The sound waves entering the ear vibrate both the eardrum and three attached small bones.
7530,最后一根小骨将过滤后的声波传至耳蜗管。听觉神经会在此将信息转化成电流脉冲传达到大脑。,"The last bone passes a filtered sound wave into the cochlear duct, where hair cells and your acoustic nerve convert the information to electrical impulses for the brain."
7530,内耳的半规管有回转仪的作用，使我们保持平衡。,The semicircular conals work like a gyroscope to keep us balanced.
7531,"常见的瓣膜问题是二尖瓣脱垂。补充一句，“二尖瓣”（mitral）这个词源自“主教冠”（miter),它是主教戴的帽子，有两个尖。","The most common valve problem is mitral valve prolapse (the name “mitral” by the way, comes from miter, the two-leaved hat worn by popes), in which the valve between the left atrium and left ventricle doesn't slam closed fully just like in Figure"
7531,如图2.3所示，位于左心房和左心室之间的瓣膜不能正常闭合。,2.3.
7532,肌肉工作时骤然动用有氧和无氧代谢途径来补充肌肉做功时消耗的高能磷酸化合物，会导致细胞内二氧化碳生成的增加。,The sudden activation of aerobic and anaerobic metabolic pathways to replenish high-energy phosphates consumed as muscles do physical work is accompanied by increased cellular carbon dioxide (C02) production.
7532,肌肉之所以能够工作是由于细胞内存在着精细的缓冲系统、底物代谢系统、氧气和二氧化碳的传输系统。,"Muscular work is possible because of elaborate systems of intracellular buffering, regulation of substrate metabolism, and oxygen (02) and C02 transport."
7532,在细胞水平上的能量代谢与呼吸和心脏功能之间的联系途径目前还不完全清楚。,The ways in which energy metabolism at the cellular level is linked to respiratory and cardiac function are not yet fully understood.
7533,心脏里的窦房结和房室结快速接触时导电，控制着心脏跳动的节奏。这个电路系统，特别是肺静脉，会因心房其他部位和心血管系统的细胞反常“短路”。,"The SA node rules your heart rhythm with quick conduction to the AV node; that electrical system can be shorted out by rogue cells from other parts of the atrium and cardiovascular system, especially the pulmonary veins."
7533,其结果是心节律失常，比如纤维性颤动。,"The effect: irregular beats, like atrial fibrillation."
7534,另外一种心律失常是房性早搏(premature atrial contraction)。,Another dysrhythmia is the premature atrial contraction.
7534,房性早搏是非常常见的，是心房中孤立的兴奋灶引发的过早的心房收缩。,This dysrhythmia is very common and results from a separate focus in the atrium initiating a premature atrial beat or contraction.
7534,"房性早搏在心电图上是很容易进行辨别的，它是良性的早搏,不需要进一步的检查，不需要限制运动。","This dysrhythmia is easily discernible on ECG, is benign and requires no further evaluation or activity restriction."
7535,卡明斯基和劳夫报告了他们对100名10~14岁参加过体育竞赛的青少年所做的一项调查。,Kaminski and Ruoff (1979) reported an investigation on 100 10-14-year-old child participants in competitive sport.
7535,他们将其生活方式和学习成绩同那些未参加体育运动但在年龄、性别、智力、社会地位、家庭成员和学校类型相一致的青少年进行了对比。,"Their lifestyle and academic achievements were compared with those of non-participants in sport matched according to age, sex, intelligence, social status, members of family and type of school."
7535,结果发现，尽管这些学生运动员积极参与体育活动，并对此花了很长时间，但是他们的学习成绩与其他学生并无差别。,"Despite their very intensive involvement in sporting activities and long time spent in sport preparation, the student athletes did not differ from the other children in school achievements."
7536,近日对阿司匹林所做的调查表明，阿司匹林能降低中风的发生几率。坚持服用阿司匹林（及其他非类固醇类抗炎药物，如布洛芬）也能减少痴呆症和阿尔茨海默病的发病几率，这可能是因为阿司匹林能保持动脉年轻。但是，不要在同一天内服用布洛芬和阿司匹林。,"Recent studies on aspirin show a decrease in strokes, and the sustained use of aspirin (and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, like ibuprofen) also reduces the incidence of dementia and Alzheimer's disease, presumably because it keeps the arteries young* But don't take both ibuprofen and aspirin on the same day."
7536,简单来说，这是因为非类固醇类抗炎药会占住血管中的特定位置，阿司匹林就无法发挥效能，两者会互相抵消对方的动脉抗衰老的功效。,"In essence, the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory occupies the site in the blood vessels and doesn't let aspirin do its work.They cancel out each other’s effects on decreasing the aging of your arteries."
7537,在急性损伤和手术后即刻，儿童和青少年可能需要使用药物来控制疼痛，用什么药以及用多大剂量取决于损伤的严重程度。,"Immediately following an acute injury or an operative procedure, children and adolescents may require pain medication.The type and dosage of the medication depend on the severity of the injury."
7537,儿童在单纯骨折时仅需服用一天左右的扑热息痛。,Young children with simple fractures rarely require medication other than a day or so of acetaminophen.
7537,年龄稍大的儿童若发生伴有明显肿胀的严重损伤，可以服用非甾体类抗炎药，如布洛芬，奈普生，托美汀硫酸盐等。,"Older children and teenagers with more severe injuries accompanied by marked swelling often benefit from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, naproxyn or tolmetin sulphate."
7538,肺癌是一种对两性来说都最为普遍的致死的病因。它的发生大部分是由于吸烟引起的（虽然不是所有的肺癌都是如此）。,Lung cancer—the most common lethal cancer in both men and women—is overwhelmingly caused by cigarette smoke (though not all lung cancer is).
7538,超过95%的患肺癌的人曾经吸过烟或者接触过大量的二手烟、氡、石棉。,"More than 95 percent of people with lung cancer have smoked or been exposed to heavy doses of secondhand smoke, radon, or asbestos."
7539,分泌这个词通常会让你想到脓、黏液和血。,"Normally, the word secretion makes you think of things like pus, mucus, and blood."
7539,他们当然不会像莫奈的画那么好看，但是分泌没有理由必须得跟那些属于恐怖电影或是身体组织的东西联系起来。,"They’re certainly not Monet-worthy images, but there’s no reason why secretion has to be associated only with things that belong in horror movies or in a tissue."
7539,原因是你的体内充满了各种器官、腺体，它们分泌出你全身的物质、营养以及激素。,"That's because you are full of organs and glands that secrete substances, nutrients, and hormones all through your body."
7540,几乎人人都尝试过这个伟大的热身练习。,Almost everybody has tried this great warm up exercise.
7540,手臂向两侧伸展，然后开始画圈。,Simply hold your arms out to the side and begin to make circles.
7540,风车是动态的，而且所需的柔韧性也比一般人所想的更大，所以你不要一开始就疯狂摇摆，否则可能扭伤那些还没有热起来的肌肉。,"The windmill is dynamic and requires more flexibility than most people realize, so don’t just start wildly swinging or you might tweak cold muscles."
7541,这种出于好意却很危险的进攻称作自体免疫反应。,This dangerous friendly fire is called an autoimmune response.
7541,结果它不仅杀死了外来入侵者，也会消灭你的身体赖以正常工作的细胞。,"So not only will it kill the foreign substance, but it will also kill the cells you need to function properly."
7541,最糟的结果是它会导致器官瘫痪，也会导致其他自体免疫疾病，如狼疮、肠炎综合征、风湿性关节炎。,"In worst cases, that can lead to organ failure, but it can also lead to other autoimmune diseases such as lupus, inflammatory bowel syndrome, and rheumatoid arthritis."
7542,"你往往会假定满足使用母数考验应具备的三个条件,而这样的假定可以藉由偏态(skewness)和峰度(kurtosis)的估计值来检验。",You frequently assume that the three criteria for use of parametric statistics are met.The assumptions can be tested by using estimates of skewness and kurtosis.
7542,"(此处只解释这些检验的意义,任何基础统计教科书都会提供更详尽的说明。关于偏态和峰度的进一步讨论，请参考 Newell and Hancock, 1984) 。","(Only the meaning of these tests is explained here. Any basic statistics textbook provides considerably more detail. For a helpful discussion on skewness and kurtosis, see Newell and Hancock, 1984.)"
7543,佛雷堡氏不全骨折（Freiberg’s infraction)又称跖骨头无菌性坏死，是因反复创伤引起的一种缺血性跖骨骨骺坏死。,Freiberg's infraction is an avascular necrosis of the metatarsal epiphysis which may result from repeated trauma.
7543,"骨骺分离及跖趾关节继发性退行性变常与本病有关（Murray, 1991)。","Separation of the epiphysis as well as secondary degenerative changes in the metatarsophalageal joint are often associated with this injury (Murray, 1991)."
7543,本病常表现为前足疼痛，特别是负重时疼痛加重。,Pain is usually present in the forefoot and is particularly aggravated by weight bearing.
7543,儿童和青春期的跑步运动员因其足部反复负重受压，为本病的高发人群，常受累的是第二跖骨。,"Children and adolescent runners are at greatest risk due to the repetitive nature and forces or pressures involved in the activity.Most often, the infraction affects the second metatarsal epiphysis."
7544,在计算鉴别度指标时，高分组与低分组的人数比例有几种常用的百分比，例如25、30、或33%。,"Various percentages of high and low scorers, such as the upper and lower 25, 30, or 33%, are used in determining discrimination indices."
7544,福乐兰根法则采用最高与最低的27%。,The Flanagan method uses the upper and lower 27%.
7544,算出每组的答对比例后，使用常态化的二分系数表来换算信度系数。,The proportion of each group answering each item correctly is calculated; then a table of normalized biserial coefficients is consulted to obtain the item reliability coefficient.
7544,因此，项目信度是指每一题的回答与测验总表现之间的关联。,"Thus, item reliability is the relationship between responses to each item and total performance on the test."
7545,20世纪70年代，俯冲轰炸机在美国海军陆战队中非常流行。,"Divebomber Pushups  used to be popular in the Marine corps, back in the 70s."
7545,它与折刀俯卧撑类似，只不过在回到起始姿势的过程中，双臂要弯曲（折刀俯卧撑是髋部向下移动时弯曲手臂，但是向上后退时双臂需要始终伸直）。,"They are similar to jackknife pushups, except you bend your arms on the way back to the start position (in jackknife pushups, bend your arms as the hips move down, but you keep your arms straight when they go back up)."
7545,第二次弯曲手臂能够让上肢更多地参与到动作当中，却影响了增强身体柔韧性的效果。,"Bending the arms a second time increases upper arm involvement, but lessens the effectiveness of the exercise as a flexibility movement."
7546,在动作最高点保持片刻，然后有控制地放低双脚。,"Hold the position at the top briefly, before allowing your feet to descend under control."
7546,多次重复练习。我发现，大的沙发式扶手椅非常适合练习俯卧抬腿。横趴在椅子上，髋部在一侧的扶手上，胸部则在另一侧的扶手上。可以向下伸手抓住椅子以帮助稳定身体。,"Repeat for high reps. I have found that big, couch-style armchairs make an excellent reverse hyperextension unit—drape yourself sideways over the chair, with your hips over one padded arm and your chest on the other, as you reach down to hook a hand under the chair for stability."
7546,如果你家里有把舒服的椅子，那就可以尝试一下（一般的床太低，会大大降低该练习的效果）。,Try this if you have a comfy chair at home—unfortunately bunks and beds just aren’t high enough to make the technique worthwhile.
7546,俯卧抬腿具有山羊挺身的全部好处，此外还不需要训练伙伴。,Reverse hyperextensions confer all the benefits of regular hyperextensions with the added plus that this variation doesn’t require a partner.
7546,该动作对那些背部有伤的训练者来说可谓福音，因为它可以增加下背部的血液循环和力量，同时又不会给背部造成压力。,"The exercise is of real therapeutic value to athletes with bad backs, because it increases circulation and tone in the lower back without the usual accompanying strain."
7547,在做俯卧挺身时，趴在地上，双脚并拢，双手置于脑后。,"When doing prone hyperextensions, lie face down on the floor with your feet close together and your hands behind your head."
7547,尽可能低抬高胸部和双脚，双膝不要弯曲。,"Simply lift your chest and feet as high as you can, without bending the knees."
7547,其实，你的四肢只能向上移动几厘米，但这确实是很好的锻炼脊椎肌肉的练习。,"In reality you will only be able to move your extremities a few inches, but this is an excellent exercise for the spinal muscles."
7547,多次重复或在动作的最高点坚持10-30秒（就像浮在水面上的小船）。,"Repeat for high reps, or go for ten to thirty second holds—whatever floats your boat."
7548,我们的骨骼生长并不需要过多的压力。,Your bones don't need much resistance to grow.
7548,事实上，骨骼生长所需压力根本就很少。,"In fact, they don't need much resistance at all."
7548,每周只要30分钟的负重训练，就可以维持和提高骨骼密度。,Just thirty minutes of weight-bearing exercise a week is all you need to maintain and build your bone density.
7548,你不必一次就把30分钟做完，一次10分钟，就可以收到最大的益处。,"What's better is that you not do it all at once; if you split it into three ten-minute sessions, you'll still gain the maximum benefit."
7548,而且这种好处是呈指数级增长的。,And you'll be reaping the benefits exponentially.
7548,每周30分钟的耐力训练几乎能让你年轻2岁。,Doing just thirty minutes of resistance training a week has a RealAge effect of making you nearly two years younger.
7549,相反，力量训练却可以在不受伤的前提下更有效地帮助跑着增加骨密度。,"Power training, in contrast, does a better job of increasing bone density without causing injury."
7549,密歇根大学骨骼与关节损伤防治和复原中心的一项研究表明，包含体操、负重训练与弹跳练习在内的训练计划——所谓的“增强式训练”——可以改善骨密度分布。,"Studies performed at the University of Michigan’s Bone and Joint Injury Prevention and Rehabilitation Center revealed that training programs that include gymnastics, weight training, and jumping and bounding exercises—known as “plyometric” training—improve bone-density profiles."
7549,这正是CFE训练课程中所设定的内容。,These are exactly the types of training modes that CFE prescribes.
7549,而且，由于包含类似长时间跑步的重复性动作，高强度／力量训练方法几乎不会造成疲劳性骨折。,"Further, because these exercises don’t involve the level of repetition that hours of running require, the high-intensity/power method is less likely to cause stress fractures."
7550,我们的骨骼生长并不需要过多的压力。,Your bones don't need much resistance to grow.
7550,事实上，骨骼生长所需压力根本就很少。,"In fact, they don't need much resistance at all."
7550,每周只要30分钟的负重训练，就可以维持和提高骨骼密度。,Just thirty minutes of weight-bearing exercise a week is all you need to maintain and build your bone density.
7550,你不必一次就把30分钟做完，一次10分钟，就可以收到最大的益处。,"What's better is that you not do it all at once; if you split it into three ten-minute sessions, you'll still gain the maximum benefit."
7550,而且这种好处是呈指数级增长的。,And you'll be reaping the benefits exponentially.
7550,每周30分钟的耐力训练几乎能让你年轻2岁。,Doing just thirty minutes of resistance training a week has a RealAge effect of making you nearly two years younger.
7551,因此，辛格倾向于以粗暴的风格和敌对行为（有时会招致纪律处分）来对抗澳大利亚队（以及其他球队，例如南非队）一直是他体育名流身份的一个重要元素。,"Thus, the propensity of Singh to match the Australians (and other teams, such as the South Africans) in abrasive style and hostile conduct (on occasion leading to disciplinary action) has been a substantial element of his sporting celebrity."
7551,在这里我所说的“后殖民复仇叙事”将哈巴杨•辛格定位为“坏男孩”，他帮助印度板球在其次级历史和当今的霸权之间实现一种突破。,"What I call here the postcolonial revenge narrative has positioned Harbhajan Singh as a ""bad boy"" who has helped to make a break between Indian cricket's subaltern history and its hegemonic present."
7551,因此，2008年当他在主场比赛中卷入与澳大利亚板球运动员的冲突招致官方处罚时，他在印度被广泛认为既是英雄也是受害者。,"Thus, at the time in 2008 when he became embroiled in conflict with Australian cricketers on their home soil and then was disciplined by the authorities, he was widely seen in India as both heroic and victimized."
7552,钾能促进动脉健康（最好从食物中摄取，每日四种水果，特别是香蕉、鳄梨和瓜类）。,"Potassium promotes arterial health (get it from dietary sources: four fruits per day, especially bananas, avocados, and melon)."
7552,每日补充维生素A不应超过2500国际单位（不少于1500国际单位）。,"And avoid more than 2,500 IU of vitamin A a day (minimum is 1,500 IU)."
7552,每天分两次正确补充复合维生素，会让你的生理年龄年轻6岁以上。,The correct multivitamin taken twice a day can make your RealAge more than six years younger.
7553,55岁以上的人较少背痛，这可能是因为他们背部负重较少的缘故。,"Back pain is much less common in older people, presumably because older people carry less tension in their back."
7553,幸运的是，下背疼痛的患者有95%可以不用手术就能治愈。,"Luckily, nearly 95 percent of lower back pain can be treated without surgery."
7553,人们对骨盆和腹部进行局部锻炼，还能预防更多的疼痛的发生。,And even more can be prevented by doing exercises that center around the pelvis and abdomen.
7554,腹部运动不仅能令骨骼和背部肌肉强健，还能锻炼身体的整个中部，这样就移走了背部所要承担的重量和压力。,"Not only will abdominal exercises strengthen your bones and the muscles of the back, but also they'll also strengthen your entire midsection—which takes weight and pressure off your back."
7554,那么，让我们把仰卧起坐加进日程安排里吧，还有抬腿运动和屈体运动。,"So add exercises like the ones in the ""Owner's Monnuol Workout""."
7554,坚持下去，也许未来的某一天，杂志封面上的健美人物就会是你。,Your magzine cover contract await you.
7555,在一些大的五金商场，你会看见店员在拖重箱子时都戴着护腰保护腰部。,"Go to one of the mego-hardwore stores, and the employees are all wearing  weight belts—those large beltlike straps that provide extra support to their waists when they haul heavy boxes."
7555,但是你知道吗？,But you know what?
7555,人体有一条天然的护腰，那就是你的腹肌。,You have a natural weight belt—your abdominal muscles.
7555,如果腹肌足够强健，就可以对后背下部起到良好的支撑。,"And if your abdominal muscles are strong enough, they'll give you the support your lower back needs."
7556,有些癌症是由具传染性的病毐引起的，比如H1V(艾滋病病毒）。,"Some cancer is caused by viruses that are contagious, like HIV."
7556,所以在某种程度上来说，人人有可能传染上癌症。,"So in a way, you can catch cancer."
7556,癌症不会通过血液、唾液或是细菌传染，但是却会通过间接的方式传染。人们会通过一些身体有机物的传播患上癌症，对于宫颈癌、肝癌和淋巴癌来说尤其如此。,"You can't swap cancer through bloodstream, saliva, or germs, but in a roundabout way, you can pass along some of the organisms that could cause cancer This is especially true for cervical and liver cancers, as well as some lymphomas."
7557,尼古丁是头号毒品，这主要是因为它对人体各部分产生的生理效应。,Nicotine is a leader in toxicity—especially because of its physiological effect on the rest of the body.
7557,成瘾本身不仅体现在对药物的心理依赖，还会表现为生理依赖。人脑告诉身体需要尼古丁，以防止良好的感觉消失。,The addiction itself is manifested not only in an emotional need for the drug but also in a physical need; your brain tells your body it needs nicotine to prevent the withdrawl symptoms.
7557,尼古丁令脑部产生愉悦感，进而感到放松，以此发挥效力。,"One of the ways it works is by creating pleasure in the brain, causing a feeling of relaxation."
7558,显而易见，不同项目损伤发生率的排名取决于该项目的普及程度。,"Clearly, the ranking of sports according to their injury rate depends on the participation rate and the extent of involvement."
7558,如在美国，橄榄球与棒球非常流行，但在欧洲热衷于此者则很少。,"For instance in the USA , American football and baseball are very popular, but they are less so in Europe."
7558,"兰德里（Landry, 1992)对两年美国高中生损伤发生率的研究进行了比较（表11.1)。",Two prospective studies performed in American high schools were compared by Landry (1992) (Table 11.1).
7558,橄榄球、女子体操以及摔跤是损伤发生率最高的项目。,"Football, girl's gymnastics and wrestling showed the highest injury rates."
7559,横断性研究的优点是个体(非仅是群体) 在生理上的差异可以进行比较。而且透过规画，调查者可进一步将可能干扰该研究变项关系的潜在因子予以控制。,"An advantage of cross-sectional studies is that the physiological differences of individuals (rather than groups) can be compared, and with planning, investigators can control for factors that could potentially confound the relationship of interest."
7559,当研究大小规模适当时，干扰因子(confounding factors) 可透过统计方法控制，或是在重要因素将两组予以配对(matching)。,"Confounding factors can be controlled using statistical methods when the size of the study is adequate, or by matching the two comparison groups on an important 3.5 factor."
7559,例如：欲控制体脂肪对于身体活动与血脂关系的干扰。研究者可招募高活动量与静态生活的两组受试者，但两组须拥有相近的体脂肪水准 (e.,"For example, to control for the confounding effect of body fat on the physical activity-blood cholesterol relationship, one could recruit highly active and sedentary people with similar levels of body fat (e."
7559,g.,g.
7559,", ±2%)。",", ±2%)."
7560,蹬起靠墙成倒立姿势。,Kick up into a handstand against a sturdy wall.
7560,像平常一样，双手距离与肩同宽，距离墙根约15到25厘米。只有双脚脚跟与墙壁接触，身体保持自然的弓形。,"As usual, your arms should be shoulder width apart and your fingers should be six to ten inches from the wall with only your feet touching the surface."
7560,如第八式那样，把身体的大部分重量（约90%）慢慢转移到一只手上。,"This will leave a slight natural curve in your body.As with Step 8, slowly transfer the majority of your weight—approximately ninety percent—onto one palm."
7560,然后翻转另一只手的手掌，使手背贴地，手心向上，手指朝前（视线方向为前）。,"Now flip your other palm over, so that the back of hand is flat on the floor with the fingers pointing away from you."
7560,将这只手臂在自己面前伸展，而这只手始终保持与地面的接触——部分体重的压力仍然要通过这只手的手指传递。,"Straighten out your arm in front of you, maintaining contact with the floor as you go.Some pressure should still be flowing through the digits of this hand."
7560,这是杠杆倒立撑的起始姿势（图123）。,This is the start position of the lever handstand pushup (fig. 123).
7561,摆出做俯卧撑的姿势，身体成一条直线，一只手撑在胸部正下方的地面上，另一只手放在身体外侧的篮球上，靠双脚和撑在地上的那只手支撑身体。,"Get into a pushup position, with your body aligned and supported by the feet and one hand flat on the floor directly below your breastbone.Place your free hand on a basketball which is out to the side of the body."
7561,双臂伸直，放在球上的手要尽量向远处伸。,It should be as far away as you can reach while keeping your palm flat on the ball.Both your arms should be straight.
7561,这是杠杆俯卧撑的起始姿势（图17）。,This is the start position of the lever pushup (fig. 17).
7562,试试这个自测方法：单脚站立，闭上双眼。,Try this self-test: Stand on one leg and close your eyes.
7562,坚持站得越久，脑部越年轻（如果年龄在45岁或以上，坚持15秒就是非常好的了）。,"The longer you can stand without falling, the younger your brain (fifteen seconds is very good if you are forty-five or older)."
7562,这种平衡运动只是体现人脑力量的一种方法。,That balancing act is just one sign of your brain strength.
7562,为了锻炼平衡机能，应该使用自由重物，如哑铃和杠铃，因为用重物锻炼可以训练“本体感受”（平衡能力）。,"To develop better balance, you should use free weights—that is, dumbbells and barbells—because exercising with them works your proprioception (your ability to balance)."
7562,使用举重机无法收到相同效果，因为重物是被固定在一个平面上的，所以举重时无法锻炼平衡能力。,"Weight machines don't have the same effect because the weights are attached to a fixed surface, so you don't develop your balancing abilities as you lift them."
7563,性发育缺失的高促性腺激素性性功能低下症很少见。,The list of definable causes of hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism without sexual development is small.
7563,绝大多数患该病的女子都有特纳氏综合征(Turner’s syndrome; 45，X性腺发育不全）或该综合征的多种变异之一。,"The overwhelming majority of these females have Turner's syndrome 45,X gonadal dysgenesis) or one of its many variants."
7563,患该病的女子在2~3岁开始生长减缓，可能伴随许多特征：出生时的淋巴性水肿 (lymphoedema at birth)，蹼状颈（webbed neck)，多重性色素痣（multiple pigmented naevi)，心脏、肾脏和大血管的异常以及小的过度凸起的指甲。,"Girls with this condition grow slowly beginning in the second or third year of life; they may have many of the associated stigmata: lymphoedema at birth, webbed neck, multiple pigmented naevi, disorders of the heart (left-sided) and kidneys (horseshoe) and great vessels (e.g.coarctation of the aorta) and small hyperconvex fingernails."
7564,高低桥需要借助一个与膝盖等高或略高的物体。,Angled bridges require an object which is about knee height or a little higher.
7564,在监狱里，床铺是最好的选择。,"In prison, a bunk is perfect."
7564,美国人家里的普通用床稍高一点，但也可以。,"The average bed in an American home is a bit taller, but still acceptable for our purposes."
7564,坐在床的边缘，身体向后躺在床上，双脚平放地上，与肩同宽。,"Sit on the edge of the bunk or bed, and lie back with your feet flat on the ground.They should be approximately shoulder width apart."
7564,身体往前挪，以便髋部离开床。双手放在头部任一侧，手指指向脚。,"Shuffle forwards a little so that your hips are off the bunk, and place your hands either side of your head, with your fingers pointing towards your feet."
7564,这是该动作的起始姿势（图87）。,This is the start position (fig. 87).
7564,双手用力下压，肘部打开，推起髋部，同时背部弯起成弧形。,"Press down through the hands, straightening the elbows and pushing the hips up, arching your back as you do so."
7564,继续平缓地尽力上推身体，至少让头部与身体完全离开床。,"Continue smoothly pushing as far as you can, at least until your head and body are entirely clear of the bunk."
7564,手臂不必完全伸直，肘部应该是弯曲的。,The arms don’t need to be fully extended; the elbows will be bent.
7564,或许你只能将自己的身体推起几厘米，那就可以了。,You may only lift up a few inches.That’s fine.
7564,有控制地向后仰头，以便能看见身后的墙壁。,"Allow your head to tilt back under control, so that you can see the wall behind you."
7564,这是该动作的结束姿势（图88）。,This is the finish position (fig 88).
7564,然后反向运动，缓慢地放低身体，直到躯干与头部再次完全躺在床上。,"Reverse the motion, lowering yourself until your torso and head are resting completely on the bunk again."
7564,重复练习，保持正常呼吸。,"Repeat as necessary, breathing normally."
7565,处在青春期的女孩，垂体肿瘤引起的高泌乳素血症（hyperprolactinaemia)是非常罕见的。但是，如果存在这种疾病，下丘脑控制促性腺激素的释放功能就会受到抑制。,"Hyperprolactinaemia due to a pituitary tumour is very uncommon in adolescent girls.However, if present it may inhibit the hypothalamic control of gonadotrophin release."
7565,使用抗多巴胺能的药物如氯丙嗪 (chlorpromazine)疗法中，常可见到轻度的髙泌乳素血症。,A common cause of mild hyperprolactinaemia is therapy with antidopaminergic agents such as chlorpromazine.
7566,若力量体操这一路不对你的胃口，那你可以尝试高位桥。,"If this brand of strength-gymnastics just isn’t your shot of whiskey, try your hand at platform bridging."
7566,使用高于地面的平台会使铁板桥（在无需增加负重的情况下）变得更难、更需要爆发力——鲜有人知道这点。,Using a platform is a little-known way to make stand-to-stand bridges harder and increasingly more explosive without adding any external resistance.
7566,在平台（比如一级台阶）上直立，然后向后弯身，最后双手落地成桥。,"Stand up straight on a raised platform.A step would be a good option.Now bend backwards, ultimately dropping into a bridge."
7567,治疗的目的在于使糖尿病患儿或青少年摆脱生活中的各种糖尿病的副作用，如低血糖、高血糖和酮症，生长延缓和精神障碍。,"Treatment should permit the diabetic child or adolescent to lead a life free from side-effects such as hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia and ketosis, growth delay and psychological difficulties."
7567,最终目的是防止发生血管、肾脏和神经系统的合并症。,"The ultimate aim is to prevent the vascular, renal and neurological complications."
7567,理想的目标是从早到晚保持正常的血糖水平，但是，这在糖尿病儿童中几乎是不可能的（在缓解期除外）。,"Ideally, therefore, blood glucose should be maintained at normal levels throughout the day and night; however, this is almost impossible in the diabetic child, except during the remission period."
7568,在准备撰写本章时，我们总共阅读了48篇文章，但其中大多数被除外了。,"In the preparation of this chapter a total of 48 published studies were reviewed, but for various reasons most of them were excluded from the set of papers on which conclusions were based."
7568,有些被排除的研究文章是没有采用对照组，即没有考虑前面提到的生长发育的重要作用的影响，这是一个特别重大的缺陷。,"Some of the excluded studies were limited by the failure to employ a control group — given the afore-mentioned importance of growth and development, this is a particularly critical limitation."
7568,其他被排除的研究报告是因为训练负荷不能精确定量。,Other studies were excluded because the dose of training was not precisely quantified or described.
7568,再有一些被除外的研究论文是因其使用了特殊的人群作为研究的对象（如患有高血压、哮喘或智力障碍的儿童）。,"Some other studies were excluded because they used special populations of subjects (e.g.children with hypertension, asthma or mental handicap)."
7569,个案研究个案研究(case study)可对个人（或机构、社区…等）提供详细的资讯。,"Case StudyThe case study is used to provide detailed information about an individual (or institution, community, and so on)."
7569,个案研究旨在了解某特定受试者或情况的独有特征，这种描述性研究技术广泛应用在医学、心理学、咨商和社会学等领域。,"It aims to determine unique characteristics about the subject or condition.This descriptive research technique is used widely in such fields as medicine, psychology, counseling, and sociology."
7569,此外，个案研究也是质性研究中所使用的一种技术。,The case study is also a technique used in qualitative research.
7570,弓步是代替深蹲的经典动作。,Lunges are a classic squat substitute.
7570,站立，双脚并拢，一只脚向前面迈一大步。,"Stand with your feet together, and take a long step out in front of you."
7570,双腿弯曲，背部挺直，直到前膝弯曲接近90°，后膝几乎接触地面。,"Bend at both knees, keeping the spine straight, until your front knee is bent at a right angle and your rear knee nearly touches the floor."
7570,双腿发力，将身体向后推，直到双腿伸直。,"Now rise back up, pushing through your feet until your knees are straight."
7570,接下来，你可以向后撤一步回到起始姿势，然后再重复，或者后腿向前迈一步再重复。,"At this point you can either continue the motion into a step backwards to the starting position and repeat, or step forwards and through with your rear leg so that you can lunge ahead, switching legs."
7570,囚室内没有太大空间，所以我们都是撤一步回到起始姿势，换腿，另一条腿向前，成弓步，撤回，再换腿。,"Obviously confined to a cell we didn’t have much space, so we stepped back to the start position and alternated our legs, lunging forwards with the right, stepping back, lunging forwards with the left, and so on."
7570,但是，如果你所处的空间很大，那就无需回到起始姿势，只需换腿继续向前即可。,"But if you have a long stretch of space ahead of you, you don’t need to keep going back to the start position.You can just keep on stepping forwards with your opposite leg."
7570,若你的双腿状态良好，那你可以这样走很长一段距离。,"If your legs are in good shape, you can cover long distances this way."
7570,我见过一位特别信赖这个方法的自由搏击选手，他通过数自己走过几遍足球场来判断自己的锻炼程度。,I once met a kickboxer who swore by this method.He didn’t even count reps—he judged his workout by lengths of his local football field!
7571,弓步压腿是非常不错的弓步变式，每次只集中锻炼一条腿。,The leg press lunge is a nice variation of the lunge which focuses on one leg at a time.
7571,将一条腿放在大约与膝盖等高的物体上。,Place one leg up on something at about knee height.
7571,对我而言，床铺比较合适，你可以借助台阶——尝试不同高度的台阶，以帮助你找到适合自己的高度。,"For me, a bunk is about right, but using stairs can help you find the best level for you.Experiment with different steps."
7571,抬起的那条腿向前伸出，膝盖略微弯曲。,"Your raised leg should be out in front of you, with a minor bend in the knee."
7571,保持背部挺直，弯曲髋部以及抬起的那条腿，直到大腿后侧紧贴小腿。,"Now—keeping your back straight—bend at the knee and hip of the raised leg, until your hamstring presses against your calf."
7571,此时，抬起那条腿的大腿应该紧贴胸部。,"At this point, your thigh should be close to your chest."
7571,后面那腿的膝盖可以略微弯曲，以确保安全。但是，主要做动作的应该是前腿。,"You can bend the knee of the rear leg a bit to ensure that you are secure, but the main motion should come from the front leg."
7571,暂停片刻，然后前腿发力，将自己推回到起始姿势。,Pause for a moment before pushing back up again with your front leg until it’s back to where you started.
7571,此动作看起来像是蹬腿，但速度更缓慢、更平缓。,"This motion looks like a kick, but obviously a lot slower and smoother."
7571,完成所定的目标次数，然后换腿。,"Complete your target reps, and then switch legs."
7571,练习几百次之后，第二天早晨你的股四头肌将会奇酸无比。,A few hundred reps will sear delicious pain into your quads the next morning.
7572,在弓箭步这项练习过程中，保持核心、臀部和画绳肌收紧。,"Throughout the exercise of lunge, one should focus on engaging your core, hips, and hamstrings."
7572,尽量保证小腿和躯干垂直于地面。,Keep your shins and torso as vertical as possible.
7572,以站立姿势开始，一条腿向前跨一大步，然后下蹲，用臀部的力量来控制动作的稳定性，另一条腿膝盖触地。,"From a standing position, take a long step forward and drop downward—using your hips to control the movement—and touch the opposite knee to the ground."
7572,使用躯干肌力撑起身体，回到站立姿势。,"Now power your body upward with your trunk muscles, returning to a standing position."
7572,换腿练习另一侧。,Repeat on the other side.
7573,弓式这是经典的脊柱练习，可以提高背部的收缩能力，并训练脊椎及其周围的韧带。,"Bow HoldThis is a classic spinal exercise that will develop the contractile ability of your back, as well as training the vertebrae and their surrounding ligaments."
7573,趴在地上，双膝弯曲，脚跟接近臀部上方，左右手分别向后抓住同侧的脚踩。,"Lie face down on the floor.Bend your knees, bringing your feet up over your buttocks, and reach back to grasp your ankles with their corresponding hands."
7573,这本身就有一种拉伸感，但还没完，之后，纯粹使用脊柱的力量，同时将胸部和双膝尽量抬高并使之离地，保持此姿势 10 一 30 秒。,"This in itself will provide a stretch, but we’re not done yet.Using pure spinal power, simultaneously lift your chest and knees as high off the ground as you can.Hold the position for between ten and thirty seconds."
7573,一旦你觉得弓式太过轻巧，便可以尝试骆驼式。,"Once you are comfortable in the bow hold, you can try the camel hold."
7574,下面谈谈具体机理。假如一个人的动脉各处已举办了20年的“聚会”——即血小板聚集，血液通道不断变窄——那么其间至少也有几年人体在学习如何利用其他途径完成动脉的工作。,"Here' s how it works: If an artery has spent twenty years throwing parties—that is, growing plaque and becoming increasingly narrow—its host body has spent at least some of those years learning how to do some of the artery's work somewhere else."
7574,这称为供血备用方式。,It's called collateral blood supply.
7575,宫颈在怀孕中发挥着重要作用。人体伸长宫颈让胚胎留在子宮里，然后宫颈缩短扩张，便于分娩生产。,The cervix plays an important role in pregnancy; it lengthens to hold the fetus in the uterus and then shortens and dilates to allow labor and delivery.
7575,由宫颈病变细胞发展成的宫颈癌，也许是最易发现并预防的癌症了。,"Cancer of the cervix, which develops from abnormal cells on the cervix, is perhaps the most detectable and preventable cancer."
7576,这是一个艰苦卓绝的技巧，但如果你下定决心、身体力行，最终肯定能掌握它。,"This is one  hell of a hard technique, and although you can master it with dedication and effort, don’t expect to do it overnight!"
7576,但也别梦想一步登天，你需要时间和耐心，在前九式中好好地发展身体。,Really take your time to milk the preliminary nine steps first.
7576,你最初的目标是完成一次完美的单臂引体向上，当你做到了之后，再进行“巩固训练”(参见第 249 页)。,"Initially,aim for just a single good rep, and practice consolidation training when you manage it (see page 268)."
7577,如果你真的在某个动作上碰到了问题，根本做不了几次，可以尝试巩固训练。,"If you are really having a problem getting just a handful of reps on a particular exercise, try consolidation training."
7577,这是我从一位狱友那里学来的。,Consolidation training is a handy little trick I learnt from a fellow prison athlete.
7577,大多数时候，我们的训练应该集中于大约10到25次反复的范围内，这对力量、肌肉以及关节的发展都有好处。,"Most of the time, you should focus on moderate to high repetitions, somewhere in the ten to twenty-five range.This is good for building strength, muscle, and joint integrity."
7578,构念效度是指一个测验得分能测量到其假设性构念的程度，通常以此测验结果与某些行为的关连来代表。,Construct validity is the degree to which scores from a test measure a hypothetical construct and is usually established by relating the test results to some behavior.
7578,例如，某些特定行为就被预期是来自在运动精神的测量中得高分的人。,"For example, certain behaviors are expected of someone with a high degree of good sporting behavior."
7578,这样的人被预期会在网球比赛中讚美对手的优秀表现。,Such a person might be expected to compliment the opponent on shots made during a tennis match.
7578,在构念效度的指标上，测验编製者可以比较运动精神量表中高得分者与低得分者在比赛中赞美对手的次数。,"For an indication of construct validity, a test maker could compare the number of times a person scoring high on a test of sporting behavior complimented the opponent with the number of times a person scoring lower on the test did so."
7579,"到目前为止，大部分重视效度 、信度 、以及项目分析的资讯都与所谓 的古典测验理论 ( classical test theory, convict conditioningT) 有关 。","Most of the information concerning the validity, reliability, and item analysis presented thus far pertains to what is called classical test theory (CTT)."
7579,近来有一些基 础性的改变出现在认知与情意行为测量的研究中 。,Some radical changes have occurred recently in the study of the measurement of cognitive and affective behaviors.
7579,"这个在教育与心理文献中引人注目的变化便是试题反应理论（item response theory, IRT) 。",The advance that has received the most attention in the educational and psychological literature is item response theory (IRT).
7580,镁是一种矿物质，它能放松支气管，从而起到治疗哮喘的作用，每天应补镁400毫克。,Magnesium is a mineral that relaxes the bronchial tubes and can help with asthma.Take 400 milligrams a day.
7580,如果你经常从肺部咳出黏液（并不是只有流鼻涕时才排出黏液，那通常是鼻窦炎引起的），那么请考虑补充N—乙酰半胱氨酸。,"If you routinely cough up mucus from your lungs (rather than mucus coming out only when you blow your nose, which is usually from sinus conditions), consider N-acetylcysteine."
7580,这种物质能够减少黏液分泌，促进谷胱甘肽的生成，有助于防止细胞受损。,"It's a substance that loosens mucus and boosts production of a substance called glutathione, which helps prevent damage in lung tissue."
7580,我们建议每日补充N—乙酰半胱氨酸两次，每次600毫克。,We recommend 600 milligrams twice daily.
7581,在损伤后及其恢复期间，体格评估应该尽可能快进行。,Assessment of physique status should take place as soon as feasible after injury and during recovery.
7581,人们必须慎重接受这一观点，即肌肉的丢失（经过皮褶校正后的围度的下降）是负氮平衡的一个提示。,Prudently one should accept that any indication of loss in muscle (decline in skinfold-corrected girths) is indicative of negative nitrogen balance.
7581,这就要求重新对情况进行评估，并且对训练和营养计划进行调整。,This requires a reassessment of the situation and likely change in the training and nutritional programme.
7581,体重下降可能伴随着骨骼矿物质含量不可逆转的缺失，这是对健康的一个严重威胁。,The possible concomitant irreversible loss in bone mineral content is a serious health risk.
7582,由罗伯特·坎贝尔（Robert Campbell) 在美国申请专利的一种新型的骨骼宽度测量夹子带有两只滑动的测量臂，将骨骼宽度测量的精度提高了一步。,A new small bone caliper based on a US patent for a double-sliding branch principle by Robert Campbell provides for a new level of precision in measuring bone breadths.
7582,测量臂末端的压力稳定，不紧也不松。,The design permits firm pressure on the ends of the branches without binding.
7582,Campbell 10夹子以发明人的名字命名，是按照独家专利协议由Rosscraft公司生产的。,"The Campbell Caliper 10, named after the inventor, is manufactured by Rosscraft under exclusive patent agreement."
7582,这种夹子有两个游标尺，可以从上下两个方向进行读数。,It has double vernier scales to permit reading in an up and down orientation.
7583,"最新的测试指标是骨骼矿物质密度（bone mineral density, BMD),经常测试的是髓关节和脊柱的骨骼矿物质密度，有时也测试全身的骨骼矿物质密度。","Most current measurements are of bone mineral density (BMD), typically for the hip or lumbar spine and sometimes for the whole body."
7583,这就造成了文献中的某些混淆。,This has led to some confusion in the literature.
7583,"例如，妇女的最大骨骼重量小于男子，因为她们的骨架比较小，但骨骼矿物质密度的性别差异不是那么清晰，并且不同部位的骨骼矿物质密度也有所不同（Bonjour et al., 1991)。","For instance, women on average have a smaller peak bone mass than men because their skeletons are physically smaller, but a gender difference in BMD is not nearly as clear-cut and probably varies from site to site (Bonjour et al., 1991)."
7583,同时，在不同年龄不同部位有不同的最大骨骼矿物质密度值。,"Also, peak BMD values for different skeletal sites are likely to occur at different ages."
7584,人体关节就类似于袜子，一旦缺少了人体内的“袜子”，骨骼间就会丧失润滑的能力，出现骨头直接相互摩擦的现象。,"Without the sock, your exposed skin would rub against the shoe, get irritated, blister, and become inflamed.It's the same concept with your joints.As you lose your internal sock, your bones lose their ability to slide, and they can rub directly against each other."
7584,若是发生了这种情况，结果就是“硬碰硬”，人会感觉很疼。,"When that happens, the effect is like stick on stick—and it hurts."
7584,这也正是骨关节炎发展的简要过程。,"In simple form, that's what osteoarthritis is."
7585,在以下这些方面，高强度训练可以得到和LSD同样的训练结果。,Here’s how high-intensity training matches up to some of the claims of the LSD method.
7585,増加骨密度。,Increasing bone density.
7585,"LSD的支持者表示通过训练可以提髙骨骼健康水平, 但是LSD也会带来负面的影响：过度的训练会引起疲劳性骨折。","While proponents of LSD running claim improved bone health as a result of their training method, LSD running can also result in the opposite: a stress fracture caused by an excessive training load."
7585,相反，力量训练却可以在不受伤的前提下更有效地帮助跑者増加骨密度。,"Power training, in contrast, does a better job of increasing bone density without causing injury."
7586,当然，任何年龄层人士都有可能患上抑郁症，但抑郁症会让人的感觉、行动和外表的衰老速度加快。,"Of course, depression is associated with any age, but it can make you feel, act, and look older fast."
7586,原因之一是，抑郁症与血管老化联系紧密。,"For one, depression is tied to cardiovascular aging."
7586,有调查显示，同时患有心脏病和抑郁症的男性和女性因心脏病死亡的几率，比那些只患有心脏病而没有抑郁症的病人要高出69%。,"In one study, men and women who had heart disease and depression had a 69 percent higher rate of death from heart disease than those who simply had heart disease and no depression."
7586,另一个调查表明，抑郁症女性患者骨密度低于正常女性，这估计是因为抑郁症患者血液中的“紧张激素”——皮质醇含量较高。,"And in another study, depressed women were found to have lower bone density than those who weren't, presumably from high levels of the stress hormone cortisol, found to be increased in the blood of depressed people."
7587,患骨软骨病的儿童，如奥-施氏病（胚骨粗隆骨软骨病）、朔伊尔曼氏病（脊柱骨软骨病）、潘纳尔氏病（青年崎形性跖趾骨软骨炎）、股骨头骨骺骨软骨病，可能会因为不同原因就诊。,"Children with osteochondroses, e.g.Osgood-Schlatter disease, Scheuermann's disease, Partner's disease and Legg-Calvé--Perthes disease, may have different reasons for seeking health care."
7587,每一种综合征均可能在运动时产生疼痛。,One symptom can be pain associated with sports activity.
7587,在此种情形下，体育运动可能不仅仅是发生疼痛的原因，而更可能是诱因。,"In such circumstances, sports activities are presumably not the cause but, rather, the provocative factor."
7588,骨软骨炎导致骨骺异常骨化区域的分离。,Osteochondritis causes separation of abnormal ossification areas within the epiphysis.
7588,骨软骨病是一种发育紊乱并与软骨骨化有关。,Osteochondroses are developmental disorders associated with anatomical sites undergoing transition from cartilage to bone.
7588,此种紊乱的发生形式各异，帕帕斯（1989)）指出生物力学因素在其中起重要作用。,"These disorders occur in different forms, but biomechanical factors can play a role in the course of the disorder as described by Pappas (1989)."
7589,成型过程是通过增加重量和改进几何结构在机械负荷最大的部位增加骨骼的强度。,Modelling increases bone strength by adding mass and improving geometric architecture where mechanical loading is greatest.
7589,"青年人对负重的体力活动的成型反应结果是骨质的贮备超出正常活动所需要的数量（Frost, 1989a)。","The modelling response to weightbearing physical activity in the young results in a reserve of bone beyond that needed for normal activity (Frost, 1989a)."
7589,因此，参加负重性娱乐活动的高中学生会在以后的生活中比同年龄的、骨质贮备少的弹钢琴的同伴更不容易发生骨折（Schultheis，1991)。,"Thus, the high school student who finds recreation in weightlifting may be less vulnerable to fractures later in life than a comparable piano player with a smaller bone bank (Schultheis, 1991)."
7590,现在，对老年人骨豁脆弱问题的兴趣引起对骨质丢失因素的大量研究工作。,The current interest in skeletal fragility in elderly people has resulted in considerable research to identify factors underlying bone loss.
7590,骨质疏松症（骨路随年龄增长而变薄）在某些地方已成为一个重大的公共卫生问题。,Osteoporosis (the thinning of bones with age) represents a tremendous public health problem in certain societies.
7590,有三个决定性因素可解释老年人群骨骼重量下降的原因。,Three determinants have been advanced to explain the cause of dangerously reduced bone mass in the older population.
7591,如果骨头密度降低的程度已很明显，那么就可能导致骨质疏松症。病症表现是骨骼密度低下，脆弱而易于断裂。,"If that decrease in bone density is significant enough, it can lead to osteoporosis—a condition in which the bones have thinned and weakened to the point where they can break very easily."
7591,对于骨质疏松症患者的骨骼来说，循环利用陈旧骨细胞和积累钙元素这两大生理过程都会很反常，陈旧骨细胞的衰变速度超过了新骨细胞的形成。,"In people with osteoporosis, those two processes of recycling old bone cells and depositing calcium are thrown out of whack, and the deterioration of old bone cells outpaces the formation of new bone cells."
7592,当然，测验有可能有信度却没有效度，但绝不可能有效度而没有信度。,"Of course, scores from a test can be reliable yet not valid, but it can never be valid if it is not reliable."
7592,例如，以一台损坏的体重器重复测量你的体重，就可能得到有信度却没有效度的结果。,"For example, weighing yourself repeatedly on a broken scale would give reliable results but not valid ones."
7592,测验信度在讨论时会以观察分数、真实分数、及误差分数这些名词来进行。,"Test reliability is sometimes discussed in terms of  observed score, true score,  and  error score."
7593,在上述类型的量表中，就像其他测量一样，效度与信度都很重要。,"In these types of scales, as with any measure, validity and reliability are important."
7593,但在体育课或竞赛中记录活动要取得一致性，比在实验室的作业中（例如线性滑轨）记录误差值要困难多了。,But it is usually much more difficult to obtain consistency in recording activities in a physical education class or sport than in recording error measurements from a laboratory task such as the linear slide.
7593,因此观察型的研究重视的是编码者的一致性。,"Consequently, observational researchers are concerned about coder consistency."
7593,一般来说，编码者会受训到具有一定水平的信度，而且在整个计划中会固定的检视此信度。,"Typically, coders are trained to a criterion level of reliability, and reliability is checked regularly throughout the project."
7593,"一种常在事件纪录或时间取样的方法中，用来估计编码者间信度的方法，被称为观察者间一致性( interobserver agreement, I0A )，其公式如下。","A common way of estimating reliability among coders, often used in event recording and time sampling, is called interobserver agreement (IOA), which uses the following formula."
7594,观察者预期误差可以经由不同方式产生影响，其通常源自其他类型的误差，例如月晕效应或是观察者偏差。,"Observer expectation errors  can operate in various ways, often stemming from other sources of errors such as the halo effect and observer bias."
7594,观察者预期可能会对评分产生不当影响。因为当人们对某些特定行为有预期时，会更倾向于注意这些行为的证据，并朝着预期方向解释观察到的内容 。,Observer expectations can contaminate the ratings because a person who expects certain behaviors is inclined to see evidence of those behaviors and interpret observations in the expected direction.
7595,现在我们有许多不同种类纠正限球屈光的外科手术，像光反射照相角膜切除术、激光手术和其他一些手术。这些手术能把角膜弧度重新塑造至完美，从而永久性纠正眼球的屈光问题。这种方法使光线能够聚焦到视网膜上。,"Now, of course, we have many varieties of refractive surgery, like photorefractive keratectomy, Lasik, and others, which can permanently correct the refractory problem by reshaping the cornea back to perfect—so that the light focuses on the retina."
7596,归纳推论同时有优缺点。,Inductive reasoning has both strengths and weaknesses.
7596,其中，最初的清单建立是关键。,"For one, the development of the original list is crucial."
7596,如果提出的现象不具代表性(这里是「危险」但被接受的活动），那么结论就可能错误或误导。,"If items are not representative of the phenomenon at hand (here it was ""dangerous but permitted activities""), then the conclusions will likely be wrong or misleading."
7596,同时提出共通性的过程也是困难的。,"Also, the process of identifying generalities can prove challenging."
7596,如果太明显（例如：这些活动都牵涉到人），那么归纳性概述可能是正确但既无趣也缺乏深意。,"If too obvious (e.g., all of these activities involve people), the inductive generalization may be true but uninteresting and lacking helpful insight."
7596,共通性同时也可能错误。,A generality might also be wrong.
7597,腘绳肌柔韧性试验。,Tests for hamstring flexibility.
7597,受试者仰卧，检査者屈一侧髋关节至90°。,The examiner flexes one hip of the supine youth to 90°.
7597,保持髋关节屈曲，检查者被动的伸展同侧膝关节直至感觉到抗阻。,"Maintaining the hip flexion, the examiner then passively extends the ipsilateral knee until resistance is felt."
7597,若被试者在试验中试图伸展髋关节，则检査者会感觉到腘绳肌远端会向外侧滑动至坐骨结节粗隆处，腘窝成角会同时发生变化。,"If the youth manages to extend the hip slightly during the test, the examiner will feel the proximal hamstrings slip slightly lateral to the maximum prominence of the ischial tuberosity, and the popliteal angle will appear to improve instantaneously."
7598,消化系统有两种激素分别控制饥饿感和食欲。,Your digestive system has two main hormones that control hunger and appetite.
7598,饥饿激素由胃部分泌，能够增强食欲。,Ghrelin is secreted by the stomach and increases your appetite.
7598,胃部变空，就会把饥饿激素派出去索要食物。,"When your stomach's empty, it sends ghrelin out requesting food."
7598,瘦素则会告诉大脑饱了。当人进食的时候，脂肪细胞会分泌瘦素，让人停止进食。,"Leptin tells your brain that you're full When you eat, your fat cells secrete it so that you stop eating."
7598,对人进食危害最大的是高果糖玉米糖浆，它是一种代糖物，是软饮料和其他许多人工甜品的添加剂。,"One of the biggest evil influences on our diet is the presence of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), a sugar substitute that is found in soft drinks and many other sweet, processed foods."
7599,运动时，尤其是在热环境中运动时出汗率是上升的。,"During exercise, especially in the heat, sweating rate is elevated."
7599,如果没有足够饮水，就会造成纯体液的丢失以及过度缺水状态 (state of hypohydration)。,"If not accompanied by sufficient drinking, it will result in a net fluid loss and a state of hypohydration."
7599,"当水的供应足够并可随意饮用时，儿童（Bar-Or et al., 1980, 1992)和成人（Pugh et al.，1967; White & Ford, 1983)常常并没有饮用足 够的水分来补充丢失的水分。","When water is available ad libitum, children (Bar-Or et al., 1980, 1992) and adults (Pugh et al., 1967; White & Ford, 1983) do not drink sufficiently to replenish fluid loss."
7600,超过三分之一的美国人有过敏问题，但大多数人并没打算控制自己的症状。,"More than one-third of Americans have allergies, but most don't have their symptoms under control."
7600,身上起疹或双眼发红最多只是让你参加老同学聚会的时候扫兴而归，而过敏对肺部的影响就是致命的了。,"While the worst a rash or red eye will do is crimp your enjoyment of the 1980s flashback party, allergies that affect your lungs can be life threatening."
7600,这被称为过敏性反应。,This is called an anaphylactic reaction.
7601,如果你自己随意服用合成代谢类固醇、减肥药或治疗其他疾病的速效药，你就是在跟你的激素瞎胡闹，就会让身体出现故障。,"Anytime you try fiddling with your hormones on your own with anabolic steroids or fixes for weight loss or other ailments, you're causing your body to go haywire."
7601,比如我们经常会了解到一些运动员通过服用代谢类固醇药或补充剂，使其代谢产生睾丸酮。,"For example, we often read about athletes who take androgenic steroids or supplements that get metabolized through to testosterone."
7601,这些多余的睾丸酮会导致非常具有侵略性的行为，所以千万不要给服用者手枪，或者什么辩题，更别提这些药产生所有的副作用，像心血管病和肾脏类病。,"This excess tesfosterone can lead to very aggressive behavior—as in, don't give that man a gun or even an argument—not to mention all the side effects like cardiovascular and kidney problems."
7602,最近加拿大的一项研究指出，在加拿大涉嫌使用合成类固醇的青年高达83000人。,A recent Canadian investigation suggested that there are up to 83000 young persons in Canada indulging in anabolic steroids.
7602,目前还没有有关残疾儿童运动员使用禁用药物的资料。,There is currently no data available regarding child athletes with a disability.
7602,儿童或青少年使用提高运动能力药物如类固醇的动机是什么？这些运动员为什么求助于它？,What would be the motivation for a child or adolescent to utilize performance-enhancing drugs such as anabolic steroids and will these athletes resort to this?
7603,直立，双脚与肩同宽，身体后方的空地要足以让训练者平躺。,Stand up straight with your feet approximately shoulder width apart.The space behind you should be clear of objects for at least the distance of your height.
7603,这是该动作的起始姿势。,This is the start position.
7603,双手置于镜部两侧，并开始向前推骨盆（图101）。,Place your hands on your hips and begin pushing your pelvis forwards (fig. 101).
7603,当骨盆移至你的极限时，开始弯曲膝盖，同时脊柱向后弯曲成弓形。,"When your pelvis is as far front as it will go, begin bending your knees as you simultaneously arch your spine backwards."
7603,然后头部向后仰，眼睛向后看。,Tilt your head back and look behind you as you go.
7603,整个过程要流畅、一气呵成。,This must all form one smooth movement.
7603,继续弯曲脊柱，直到你可以看到身后几厘米的地面。,Continue this arching motion until you can see the ground a few feet behind you.
7603,一旦看到地面，就让双手离开髋部并将其举过头顶（图102）。,"As soon as you see the floor, take your hands off your hips and pass them back over your shoulders, beyond your head (fig. 102)."
7603,这种姿势要求你有很好的柔韧性，前移的髋部加上弯曲的膝盖能够防止你向后摔倒。,"This moving posture requires considerable flexibility, but you will find that the forwards shift of your hips combined with the bend in the knees prevents you from falling backwards."
7603,继续向后、向下运动，手臂保持伸展，直到手掌接触地面。,"Extend your arms as you keep the movement going, until your palms are resting on the floor."
7603,这是合桥的结束姿势（图103），标准的桥式。,"This is the finish position of closing bridges, the full bridge hold (fig. 103)."
7603,接着，弯曲手臂与双腿，直到背部着地。,"From here, bend the arms and legs until your back is on the floor."
7603,然后站起来，回到起始姿势，重复动作。,Now stand up into the start position again to begin your second repetition.
7603,在整个练习组中，保持正常呼吸。,Breath normally throughout the set.
7604,"磷原子核磁共振谱学（phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance spectra scopy, 31P MRS)的应用，减少了对儿童到底是无氧代谢能力低还是有氧工作效率高这一问题的研究难度。",The difficulty in determining whether children have reduced anaerobic capacity or increased aerobic efficiency may be lessened with the useof phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
7604,这项技术是一种无创性测定Pi、PCr和pH的技术，从而可用于对儿童进行研究。,"This techniqueprovides non-invasive means of monitoring Pi, PCr and pH, that areacceptable for studies in children."
7604,这些指标又可以用来评价骨骼肌的有氧代谢过程和肌肉内糖酵解的活性。,"These variables, in turn, allow the assessment of muscle oxidative m etabolism and intram uscular glycolyticactivity."
7605,最主要的三种皮肤癌〔基细胞癌、扁平 细胞癌和黑色素瘤）细胞形态不同因此也有不同表现。,"The three main kinds of skin cancer (basal cell, squamous cell, and melanoma) originate from different cell types and therefore have very different behaviors."
7605,真正活跃的是黑色素瘤，就像个流窜犯。,"The one that really jumps around is melanoma, which is a peripatetic cell anyway."
7605,基细咆和扁平细胞限于外部皮肤，所以癌症都是局部的侵袭。这些癌症都是与接触阳光有关，而黑色素瘤——与死亡联系紧密的癌症，却与阳光无关。,"The basal and squamous cells are limited to the outer skin, so they invade locally; these are linked to sun exposure, while melanoma—the one most associated with risk of death—is not."
7606,男性动脑、行动和解决问题的速度更快（这种情况可以追溯到男性必须用矛刺杀毛茸茸的猛犸象的那个时期），而女性则拥有较强的横向思维能力即分析复杂事件的能力。,"Men use their brains faster to act and solve a problem (it stems back from the days when men had to spear the wooly mammoth), while women have better lateralization that is, the ability to analyze a complex topic."
7606,为了便于埋解，这里有个好例子。男性购物时，他们知道白己要买剃须刀，在商店里搜索，找到剃须刀付钱走人。,"Here is a good way to think about it: When men go shopping, they know they need shaving cream, so they walk into the store, find it, pay for it, and leave."
7607,眼睛基本上是通过观察从外界获取信息，再传输给大脑。,"To see, your eye essentially takes information from outside sources and passes it along to your brain."
7607,正如你从图8.1看到的，信息穿过角膜即一层透明的覆盖物，到达虹膜，虹膜是眼睛的有色部分，负责调节光线，以使光线到达视网膜。,"As you can see in Figure 9.1, information travels through the cornea, the clear covering of the eye, to the iris, which is the colored part of the eye charged with regulating the light that can hit the retina."
7607,在虹膜的后面是晶状体，它的形状就像一个照相机的镜头。,"Behind the iris sits the lens, which is shaped like a camera lens."
7608,"对于那些习惯后脚跟先落地的跑者,他们的小腿大多数都缺乏弹性。","For runners who are habitual heel strikers, elasticity forces of the lower legs are largely dormant."
7608,"比起积极蹬地,后脚跟落地意昧着脚部和地面接触的时间更长, 这是一种偷懒的跑步方式。","Rather than popping off the ground, a heel strike involves longer contact with the ground in the form of a land-to-rolling push-off.It’s a lazy way to run."
7608,"就像前面提到的，穿高科技的跑鞋并没有什么帮助，反而对脚跟部位的过分保护,这也导致了后脚跟先落地的跑步方式。这类跑鞋帮跑者避免了所有的伤害,包括脚跟接触地面所带来的自然的冲击。","As discussed earlier, the wearing of bulky running shoes does not help; often overbuilt in the heel, these shoes enable heel striking because they shield runners from the pain that would otherwise naturally ensue when the heel hits the ground."
7609,在最具说服力的研究中，有一份2011年来自哈佛大学的报告，专家们对竞技长跑运动员的受伤概率进行了研究，受伤概率令人担忧:每年有3/4的跑者经历过中度至重度的跑步损伤。,Among the most persuasive research was a 2011 retrospective study in which researchers at Harvard looked at injury rates in competitive distance runners and found an alarming rate of injury: Three out of four of the runners experienced a moderate to severe running injury each year.
7609,专家们发现，后脚跟落地的跑者占受伤者的大多数。他们在报告中写道：“在重复性压力损伤的概率方面，那些习惯用后脚跟落地的跑者的损伤概率是习惯前脚掌落地跑者的两倍。”,"Particularly revealing was that heel-striking runners accounted for most of the injuries documented by researchers, who wrote, ""Those who habitually rear-foot strike had approximately twice the rate of repetitive stress injuries than individuals who habitually forefoot strike."""
7610,后手翻动作快如闪电，需要亲身体验才能真正领会，所以动口不如动手，但我至少可以给你一些指点。,"Back handsprings are a lightning fast move that need to be experienced to really be understood, so describing how to do them is kind of artificial, but I can at least give you a few pointers."
7610,用力跳起，但不单单向上跳，而是既向上又向后跳。,"Jump hard, but don’t jump up; jump up and back."
7610,手臂随之尽快上摆，越过头顶向后摆。,"Coordinate your arms with the movement, swinging up, overhead and back as fast as you can."
7610,后背收紧成弓形，头部始终处于两臂之间，在地面上找个点放置双手。,"Arch your back tight and keep your head back between your arms, looking for a place to plant your hands."
7610,在发现这个点的同时，双腿也顺势上摆，惯性会完成其余的工作。,"When you find one, continue swinging your legs as momentum carries you over."
7610,一旦掌握后手翻，你可能就想尝试后空翻，后空翻与后手翻动作相同，只是双手不着地。,"Once you have mastered the back handspring, you might want to try the backflip—which is the same move, but without placing the hands on the ground."
7610,这需要腿和脊柱更具爆发力，同时腹部也要很有力才能把双膝带过去。,"This requires much more explosive leg and spine power, as well as powerful abs to tuck the knees up and over."
7610,后空翻还可以发展成其他特技（如果你想探索的话），比如蹬墙后空翻、后空翻踢、转体空翻等。,"It’s a brilliant exercise which will lead on to other tricks like wall flips, flash kicks (i.e., overhead flip kicks), twisting flips and so on, if you wish to explore these kind of moves in your training."
7611,其实，急于探索后手翻并不是坏事。除了看起来相当妙之外，在很多方面该动作都算是桥的“弹震式”版本：它能够让你以比桥更具爆发力的方式训练脊椎肌肉、髋部和腿部，还会迫使你的全身以迅疾的运动风格做动作。,"In fact, the urge to explore this move is no bad thing; as well as looking damn sweet, the back handspring is in many ways the plyometric counterpart of bridging—it allows you to train your spinal muscles, hips and legs in a more explosive manner than bridging does, and it has the benefit of forcing the entire body to act in a rapid, athletic fashion."
7611,其实，一旦你的髋部与脊柱通过桥练习被打开之后，后手翻就并非高不可攀了。,"Actually, once your hips and spine are loosened up from bridging, learning the back handspring isn’t all that hard."
7611,如果你坚持不懈，即便身体超重也能做到这个。,"Provided you are fast and follow through, even heavy guys can pull it off."
7611,我多次见到胖乎乎的武术家洪金宝表演后手翻，还是在他 40多岁时。,"I’ve seen chubby martial arts star Sammo Hung perform the technique many times, well into his forties."
7611,关键在于信心。,The real key to the move is confidence.
7612,辛格显然没有“内心不甘”，他必须“承受暴力再保持沉默”。,"Harbhajan has clearly not ""seethed within,"" having to ""listen to abuses and keep quiet."""
7612,后殖民主义复仇叙事从来不被允许在这之中采用，尤其考虑到殖民统治者“分而治之”的策略。,"The postcolonial revenge narrative can never be permitted to be directed within, especially given the divide-and-conquer strategies of colonial powers."
7612,这内外的二元结构清晰地勾勒了辛格对与斯里山特发生肢体冲突后的反应:,This outsider-insider binary structure is clearly delineated in Harbhajan's reflection on the physical confrontation with Sreesanth:
7613,"他们令患者安静时呼吸冷空气，气量与运动中气量相等，发现呼吸增强后呼吸道阻塞的程度和运动后相同（Deal et al., 1979a)。","They then had the patients at rest breathe volumes of cold air equal to those they breathed during exercise, and showed a degree of airway obstruction following the hyperpnoea equal to that which followed the exercise (Deal et al., 1979a)."
7613,"而后，如吸入温湿空气，此反应就消失(Deal et al., 1979a)。","Again this response w as abolished if the inspired air was warmed and humidified (Deal et al., 1979a)."
7613,这些学者阐明，总的呼吸道热交换和呼吸道阻塞程度之间存在着密切的相关。,These investigators illustrated a close correlation between total respiratory heat exchange and degree of airway obstruction.
7614,首先，将呼吸系统想象成一棵倒栽的树（见图5.1）。,"To start, think of your respiratory system as an upside-down tree (see Figure 5.1)."
7614,我们要追踪吸进的一口空气的旅行过程。先从口腔和鼻子开始。,"If we follow a breath of air, we’ll start with your mouth and nose."
7614,空气进入体内，顺气管向下流动。,"When air enters your body, it goes down your trachea."
7614,这就是“树干”——呼吸过程开始处的一道通风管。,That's your trunk—the one airway at the beginning of the process.
7614,接着，气管分为两条支路，将空气分开输送到两边的肺中。输送是由支气管完成的。,Then it quickly divides into two airways to feed into two lungs; those are your bronchial tubes.
7615,打造自己的家庭健身房只需要一个壶铃、一副跳绳和一个安装引体向上单杠的地方。,"You can start building your home gym with just a kettlebell, a jump rope, and a place to install a pull-up bar."
7615,这些器械只能满足进行身体自重的CFE训练。,This will suffice for the many CFE workouts that use body weight only.
7615,"然而某些时候,你也希望做一些自由力量的练习。","At some point, however, you will want free weights."
7615,"虽然你可以在健身中心或 者商业健身房进行CrossFit训练,但是这些地方普遍没有高弹片(奥林匹克举重的必需品——进行更大重量的举重时,扔扛铃是很普遍的动作)。","Although it is possible to do CrossFit workouts at fitness centers and commercial gyms, they generally don’t have bumper plates (a necessity with Olympic lifts—dropping the barbells is routine when youpursue heavier lifts)."
7616,Dennis Bramble (丹尼斯.布兰布尔）和Daniel Lieberman (丹尼尔•利伯曼）对这个问题思考了很多。,Dennis Bramble and Daniel Lieberman are two people who have  thought a lot about this.
7616,他们在《自然》杂志发表的文章中，描述持续运动的解剖和代谢特征，促使了智人（Homo sapiens)的进化。,"Writing in the journal Nature, they describe  the anatomic and metabolic features that enable sustained exercise that evolved for Homo sapiens."
7616,文章中的数据包括了肌肉骨骼改造的化石证据：腿部弹性回缩力增强（腿部肌腱长，纵向足弓髙），躯干稳定性增加（骶骨变宽，扩大臀大肌），以及体温调节的优化以适应炎热的非洲大草原（有效的汗腺，缺乏体毛，直立的姿势），这些使能量使用的经济性得到了提髙。,"The list includes fossil evidence for musculoskeletal adaptations that improve energy economy derived from enhanced elastic recoil of the legs (long leg tendons, high longitudinal foot arches), factors allowing trunk stabilization (widened sacrum, enlarged gluteus maximus muscle), and optimized thermo-regulation for hot African plains (effective sweat glands, lack of body hair, erect posture)."
7617,另一种形式是当视网膜下有异常血管形成时，会出现湿性黄斑变性。,"""Wet"" macular degeneration occurs when abnormal blood vessels form under the retina."
7617,这些血管最终会渗漏出血细胞，并会毀坏视网膜。,The vessels eventually leak blood elements and damage the retina.
7617,在有些情况下，激光治疗能够改善或延缓这种湿性黄斑变性。,"In some instances, laser treatment can improve or slow the progress of wet macular degeneration."
7617,另外，复合维生素能够推迟这一变性，或在某些情况下防止有些人的早期湿性黄斑变性转变成失明。,We also know that multivitamins can delay or in some cases prevent early wet macular degeneration from becoming ''eye blinding' in some people.
7617,我们知道黄斑变性是一种基因状况，但更是一种生活方式造成。,We know that macular degeneration isn't as much of a genetic condition as it is one of lifestyle.
7617,所以，选择正确的生活方式，保持血管年轻，你将会减少这两种形式的黄斑变性的发生几率。,So making lifestyle choices that keep your arteries young will reduce your chances of developing both forms of macular degeneration.
7618,总体而言，现有的横向研究说明，经过大强度训练的年轻竞技运动员的月经周期长短同参照检验组相比并无明显差异。而短黄体期、黄体期不足（luteal phase insufficiency)和无排卵期的现象在年轻运动员群体中是比较常见的。,"Cross-sectional studies in intensively training adolescents have revealed that menstrual cycle lengths are not different from controls, whereas luteal phase insufficiency, short luteal  phase and anovulation are much more common in young athletes."
7618,不同的训练会引起不同的激素反应。当然，还要考虑其他的影响因素。,"There is an indication that different types of activity evoke different hormonal responses, although selectioncriteria cannot be excluded."
7619,采用活垒后的医疗费用支出比采用固定垒板减少了98%。,The medical costs for injuries with stationary bases would be reduced by 98% with the use of breakaway bases.
7619,虽然活垒的售价是固定垒的两倍，但使用活垒后的医疗费用支出减少是非常明显的。,"Unfortunately, breakaway bases are nearly twice as expensive as stationary bases; however, the health-care cost saving clearly justifies their use."
7619,不同的活垒可满足不同年龄层次的需求。它们绝大部分是通过维可牢尼龙搭扣固定在地面垒板上。,"Breakaway bases have been developed for different age groups, most of which attach via Velcro to a plate that is anchored at ground level."
7619,活垒有不同的型号，可供青少年、成年和职业运动员使用，每一型号均需强大的冲力才能使其移位。,"Youth, teen, adult and professional models are available, each of which requires increasingly greater force to dislodge."
7620,卵巢释放出的一个卵子被输卵管抓住。,The ovary releases an egg that is grabbed by the fallopian tube.
7620,一旦卵子与输卵管失之交臂或留在输卵管里，就 会发生宫外孕。,"If the egg misses this tube or stays in it, ectopic pregnancy can occur."
7620,当卵子穿过输卵管，向子宫运动时，为了争取与卵子结合，精子之间会发生激烈的生死竞争，如果精子数量少或活性低（怠惰不前），都有可能失败。,"As the egg passes toward the uterus, sperm try to fertilize the egg in a savage competition for survival, but low sperm count or motility (lazy sperm) can limit their success."
7620,卵子受精后，会嵌入子宫壁中进一步生长，但是子宫感染或有纤维瘤，就会妨碍受精卵着床。,"After fertilization, the egg inserts info the wall of the uterus for development, but infections or fibroids of the uterus can inhibit implantation."
7621,弹震式俯卧撑也就是众所周知的击掌俯卧撑，是一种爆发力练习。,"The plyometric pushup is also known as clapping pushup.This is the standard pushup, but done explosively."
7621,动作过程中身体始终要挺直，快速下降到最低点后再用力将自己推起，当动作达到最高点时让手掌暂时离地。,"Keeping the body ramrod stiff, descend quickly into the bottom position before driving up so hard that the hands leave the floor briefly."
7621,在半空中快速击掌，然后让手掌着地，反复练习。,"While in mid-air, clap the hands together in the split second before your palms meet the floor again and then repeat the exercise."
7622,消化系统有两种激素分别控制饥饿感和食欲。,Your digestive system has two main hormones that control hunger and appetite.
7622,饥饿激素由胃部分泌，能够增强食欲。,Ghrelin is secreted by the stomach and increases your appetite.
7622,胃部变空，就会把饥饿激素派出去索要食物。,"When your stomach's empty, it sends ghrelin out requesting food."
7622,瘦素则会告诉大脑饱了。当人进食的时候，脂肪细胞会分泌瘦素，让人停止进食。,"Leptin tells your brain that you're full When you eat, your fat cells secrete it so that you stop eating."
7623,"1855年，德国军医布赖特豪普特 (Breithaupt)报道了在年轻新兵中发生的此类损伤，这是有关应力性骨折的第一篇医学文献（Breithaupt, 1855)。","The first report of a stress fracture in the medical literature was that of the German military surgeon Breithaupt in 1855 who noted the occurrence of these lesions in young military recruits (Breithaupt,1855)."
7623,因为多发生在军事训练中，此种损伤随后被命名为“行军骨折”。在以后的文献中还有多种关于此类病症的命名，如疲劳性骨折、自发性骨折（spontaneous fracture)、伪性骨折 (pseudofracture)、机能不性全骨折 (insufficiency fracture)。,"These lesions were subsequently identified as 'march fractures' because of their propensity for occurrence with military training.This entity has been identified in subsequent literature by a variety of terms, including fatigue fracture, spontaneous fracture, pseudofracture and insufficiency fracture"
7624,身体发育程度对最大自主收缩力量的影响是独立的，这种影响可能是通过神经系统发育程度的提高和控制能力的增强所致。,"Maturity might exert an independent influence on maximal voluntary strength, possibly through mechanisms of enhanced neurological maturation and control."
7624,肌肉力量的大小与运动单元激活的程度有关，而运动单元的激活程度取决于自主神经发放冲动的水平和被募集运动单元的激活水平。因此与年龄大或早发育的男孩女孩比，较晚发育的男孩女孩很可能无法最大程度地激活自己的肌肉。,"Less mature boys and girls are perhaps not able to maximally activate their muscles because the degree of motor unit activation, which is dependent upon both the level of voluntary neural drive and the level of activation of recruited motor units, is diminished in comparison with older or more mature boys and girls."
7625,倒立撑可以靠墙做，也可以“自由”做（无任何凭靠），后者要求训练者在平衡训练上投入的精力和在力量训练上投入的一样多。,"Handstand pushups can be done either with the back against the wall, or “free”—without support.The latter style requires that the athlete expend as much energy on balance as on strength."
7625,本书（《囚徒健身》）的主要目标是发展肌肉与力量，所以这套系统将集中于有墙壁依靠的练习。,"The main goal of Convict Conditioning is the development of muscle and might, so this system focuses on the wall-supported variety."
7625,如果你对自由倒立撑感兴趣，那么先掌握前几式靠墙的动作，这将带给你绰绰有余的力量，使你能够应付自由倒立撑。,"If you are interested in the non-supported version, master the early steps against the wall first; this will give you more than enough power to tackle the non-supported version."
7626,以前对运动生理的理解很简单。,Once upon a time the understanding of exercise physiology was easy.
7626,认为各种形式的运动表现的关键是心脏，心脏的功能决定人类跑步、游泳以及骑自行车能到多远和多快。,"The key to all forms of exercise performance was the heart, whose function determined how far and how fast humans can run, swim, or cycle."
7626,一旦达到心脏的能力极限，肌肉出现供氧不足，就会释放乳酸。,"Once the heart’s limiting capacity is reached, the muscles become oxygen deficient, releasing poisonous lactic acid."
7626,乳酸干扰正常肌肉功能，引起机体疲劳。,"The lactic acid interferes with normal muscle function, causing the anguish we recognize as fatigue."
7627,在俄勒冈州本德市的实验室里，迪查理对他研究的运动员进行了全面的测试，他想找出影响良好运动表现的不平衡点和弱点所在。,"From his lab in Bend, Oregon, Dicharry studies each athlete he works with from the ground up, looking for imbalances and weaknesses that are allowing good performance to leak out."
7627,显然，力量和协调性是良好运动表现的必要条件，但是迪查理指出，如果你不能保持正确的跑姿，核心力量也不能正常发挥作用。,"Strength and conditioning are a big part of good performance, but Dicharry maintains that core strength work isn’t much help unless you are using good positions in your running."
7627,他说：“更好的姿势意味着更好的肌肉控制力。”,"Says Dicharry, “Better posture means better muscle recruitment.”"
7628,每一个年龄组，早熟男孩都比正常发育和晚发育男孩的肌肉力量大。早熟男孩与晚熟男孩之间的力量差异在13~16岁时最明显。,Early maturing boys have a larger muscle strength at each age than their average and later maturing peers.The strength differences between contrasting maturity groups are most marked among 13 and 16 year olds.
7628,早熟男孩力量较大是他们体型和肌肉重量较大的反映。,The higher strength for the early maturing boys reflects their larger body size and muscle mass.
7629,注意！,Caution!
7629,不要将中央运动振荡器和我们前面章节提到的中央控制器混淆。,Don’t confuse this central motor oscillator with the alleged central governor we encountered in the previous chapter.
7629,他们的名字相似，但它们主管完全不同的方向。,"Their names are similar, but they’re altogether different directors."
7629,它们在不同的房间工作，甚至在不同的楼层。,"They work out of different cubicles, even on separate floors."
7629,我们都拥有前者（中央运动振荡器），它控制肌肉收缩的模式和速度，从而让我们能够走、跑、游泳和骑自行车。,"We all possess the former, which controls the pattern and rate of muscle contractions that let us walk, run, swim, and cycle."
7629,中央控制器则主要负责提出策略，具有控制、制动功能，能决定我们比赛的速度，同时让我们避免过度发力造成的危险。,The other is a proposed strategizer (with a brake) that might determine our pace during racing and could keep us from dangerous levels of overexertion.
7630,所有在本章被列举到的关于视觉运动时机掌控的技能（除了简单反应时间）也会通过训练得到提髙。,"In sports where it counts, all the skills of visuomotor timing enumerated in this chapter (except simple reaction time) also improve with training."
7630,尽管这样，请注意，这种技能的获得通常具有髙度的项目特异性。也就是说，一个棒球击球手可以很好地击打投球，但是他在篮球场上，为一个弹起的球分配跳跃时间的能力却是非常一般的。,"(It is important to note, though, that such gains are typically highly task specific. That is, a baseball batter gets better at hitting a pitched ball, but his ability to time a jump for a rebound on the basketball court will remain limited.)"
7630,在这些运动中获得运动能力提髙的基础是大幅度提髙神经肌肉协调性和时间分配能力。,"The basis for improvement in these sports, then, is largely that of enhancing neuromuscular coordination and timing abilities."
7630,随后，提髙拦截能力——从而提髙运动表现——的唯一方法就是去进行大量的比赛和练习。,"It follows, then, that one way to improve such perceptuomotor function—and thereby improve performance—is to simply play and practice a lot."
7631,此外，肌纤维类型也是很重要的。,"Important in this discussion, too, is a consideration of type of muscle fiber."
7631,短跑运动员的腿部肌肉比我们其他人拥有更髙比例的快肌或II型纤维。,"Sprinters tend to possess a higher proportion of what are called fast-twitch, or Type II, fibers in their leg muscles than the rest of us do."
7631,这些肌纤维通过快速收缩和使用无氧代谢，是促进短时间高强度的运动专家。,These fibers are specialists in facilitating short bursts of high-intensity activities by their rapid contraction times and use of anaerobic metabolism.
7631,非运动员的小腿肌肉（腓肠肌）由50%的快肌纤维组成，优秀短跑运动员的腓肠肌则是75%左右。,The calf (gastrocnemius) muscle of non-athletes is made up of about 50% fast-twitch fibers.The same muscle in a typical elite sprinter has about 75%.
7632,身体活动领域的研究可以看成一条一端为应用性研究，另一端为基础性研究的连续线。,Research in our field can be placed on a continuum that has applied research at one extreme and basic research at the opposite extreme.
7632,两极端的研究各拥有其特徵。,The research extremes are generally associated with certain characteristics.
7632,应用性研究所侧重的为立即性问题的解决，使用真实的环境，以人为参与者，对研究环境做有限的控制，但研究的结果对实务人员具有直接的价值。,"Applied research tends to address immediate problems, use so-called real-world settings, use human participants, and involve limited control over the research setting, but it gives results that are of direct value to practitioners."
7632,另一端的基础性研究通常在探讨理论性问题，通常以实验室做为研究的环境、常常以动物做为参与者、审慎控制情况、所得到的研究结果较无法做直接的应用。,"At the other extreme, basic research usually deals with theoretical problems.It uses the laboratory as the setting, frequently uses animals as subjects, carefully controls conditions, and produces results that have limited direct application."
7633,在完成基础训练阶段后，接下来是为期一个月的坡度跑训练，这期间跑者将按照利迪亚德的“弹簧”模式训练。,Following this base-building phase came a month of hill work during which runners used a form Lydiard called “springing.”
7633,本阶段的训练是为跑者下一阶段的速度训练做准备。,This was a kind of bounding that prepared runners for the speed phases of the program.
7633,在4周的坡度跑训练后，采用利迪亚德训练计划的跑者将进行传统的速度训练，即在跑道上完成间歇跑训练。接下来是训练的峰值期，为的是带给跑者最佳运动表现。,"After 4 weeks of hill training, Lydiard’s runners moved on to traditional speed work, running intervals on a track, followed by a peaking period that was intended to bring them to their best possible performance."
7634,基因改造目前的研究对于线虫或者相近物种，有希望在延缓其衰老方面获得成功。,Genetic Manipulation                                                                                                If you happen to be a nematode worm—or are closely related to one—there is hope for you.
7634,二十多年前就有报道称，线虫体内的单基因突变显著地延长其生命，在某些个体中，寿命延长多达六倍。,"More than 20 years ago, investigators reported that a single gene mutation in C. elegans significantly lengthened the worm’s life span, as much as sixfold in some cases."
7634,从那时起，抗衰老的基因突变在大量的生物体中被发现。,"Since that time, antiaging gene mutants have been described in a large number of organisms."
7634,在大鼠身上也发现了这类基因，而大鼠与人类的同源性约为50%到60%。,"The most advanced in terms of evolution is the mouse (with increases that are much more conservative, at 50 to 60%)."
7635,一个著名的例子是职棒大联盟的投手托米• 约翰（Tommy John) 在经历了手臂的大手术之后变成了一个更好的投手。,"A notable example is major league pitcher, Tommy John, who became a much better pitcher after undergoing extensive surgery on his arm than he had been before."
7635,这样的情形在20世纪60年代兴奋剂出现之后变得更加引人注目。,The picture changed even more dramatically when performance-enhancing drugs became common in the 1960s.
7635,时至今日，人们通过操纵基因工程并提高运动员的“天赋”可能会取代“熟能生巧”。,"Today, advances in genetic engineering raise the specter that manufacturing athletic talent may overtake ""practice makes perfect."""
7636,为了应对绝经期产生的健康问题，激素补充疗法成为一种常用的治疗手段。,"To combat the problems associated with menopausal symptoms, hormone replacement therapy (HRT)—or, as its now called, hormone therapy (HT)—became a popular treatment."
7636,由于人体激素含量随着年龄增长而下降，人们认为摄取激素可能会让我们保持年轻。,"Since we lose levels of hormones as we age, it was thought that ingesting hormones could be a way of keeping us young."
7636,激素补充疗法存在的缺陷是会产生非常严重的副作用，比如静脉堵塞现象增多，这会引发血栓转移至肺部（即肺栓塞），也可能引发癌症和心脏病。,"The problem with HT is that it is linked to very serious side effects, including increased vein clotting, which can lead to a clot breaking off and traveling to the lungs (pulmonary embolism), cancer and heart attacks."
7637,当然，每一块肌肉的功能各不相同， 不宜承受的外力方式也各不一样。不过，我们还是打算主要关注一种常见的与衰老有关的肌肉虚弱问题——背痛。,"Of course, while every one of those muscles serves a different purpose and each is susceptible to its own form of strain, tears, and other kinds of injuries, we want to focus on the most common and debilitating muscle problem in terms of aging: back pain."
7637,首先，我们简单回顾一下基础知识。,"First, let's tour your back."
7637,人的脊柱是弯曲的蛇形结构，由许多小骨头——椎骨组成，椎骨彼此相叠，构成脊柱。,"Your spine is the snakelike curved structure made up of samll bones called the vertebrae, which are stacked one on top of another to form a column."
7637,在相邻的椎骨间，是起到缓冲垫功能的椎间盘。,"Between each two vertebrae, there's a disc that provides cushioning."
7637,我们可以把脊柱结构想象成垒作一摞的果冻面圈，椎骨就是半硬的面圈，湿软夹心是椎间盘。,Think of the spinal structure as a series of jelly doughnuts ——with the vertebrae acting as the semihard casing and the discs as the squishy substances inside that casing.
7638,在统计和数学运算中，有一部分比较容易理解的是关于分数的集中趋势（central tendency)和变异性（variability)之计算。,Some of the more easily understood statistical and mathematical calculations are those that find the central tendency and variability of scores.
7638,当你有了一组分数，可以用一个数字来代表群体，这个数字通常就是平均数、中位数或众数。,"When you have a group of scores, one number may be used to represent the group.That number is generally the mean, median, or mode."
7638,这些词语都是用来表达集中趋势的方法。,These terms are ways of expressing central tendency.
7638,此外，在这群分数中，每一个个别分数和前述呈现集中趋势的分数都会有某种程度的差别。,"Within the group of scores, each individual score differs to some degree from the central tendency score."
7639,事实上，莱昂纳多•达•芬奇已经设计了计步器来计算步数，测量距离。,"In fact, Leonardo da Vinci had already designed a pedometer to measure distance by counting steps."
7639,计步器记录的是腰部垂直方向的加速度和减速度。,The pedometer records the acceleration and deceleration of the waist in the vertical direction.
7639,其工作原理是，由一条复杂弹簧平衡的一只机械臂在悬吊方向上受到轻微摇晃时上下摆动。,The functional principle is that an arm balanced by a delicate spring is displaced downwards by slight jolts in the direction of suspension.
7640,各种便携式加速度测量仪 (accelerometer)能够较好反映每天的体力 活动情况，加速度测量仪也叫动作记录仪 (actometer)。,A better reflection of daily physical activity is given by portable accelerometers also called actometer.
7640,当一个人移动时，肢体和身体都在加速和减速。,"When a person moves, the limbs and body are accelerated and decelerated."
7640,在呼吸仓内用测力台进行的检测表明，加速度测量仪的结果与能量消耗量非常一致。,Measurements with force—platform in a respiration chamber showed good agreement with energy turnover.
7641,你无法计算在短跑过程中实际产生的马力，因为产生功率的矢量（身体 运动的方向）发生在多个方向（垂直、水平、横向），弹性反冲的贡献不能准确地量化，而且个人身体部分之间都发生能量转移。,"You aren’t able to actually calculate horsepower production during sprinting since vectors of power production (directions of body movement) occur in multiple directions (vertical, horizontal, lateral), the contributions of elastic recoil can’t be accurately quantified, and energy transfer occurs between individual body segments."
7641,此外，在推动身体朝向终点时，腿部肌肉功率产生的大小，取决于比赛的部分。,"Moreover, the magnitude of the leg muscles’ power production in propelling the body toward the finish line depends on the portion of the race."
7641,当达到一个稳定的速度，部分能量转移和弹性反冲主要负责推动力，但加速阶段则需要更多的功率输出。,"Much more is required in the acceleration phase, although segment energy transfer and elastic recoil largely account for propulsion once a steady speed has been attained."
7642,脂肪在咽喉后部积累，引起打鼾，在人入睡时，周边肌肉放松，还会引发睡眠呼吸暂停综 合征。,Fat accumulates in the back of the throat and causes snoring and sleep apnea when the surrounding muscles relax during sleep.
7642,在舌后部的会厌不让贪物进入气管（主通风口），避免呛着。,"At the back of the tongue, the epiglottis protects the trachea (windpipe) from food and prevents choking."
7642,甲状腺就位于脖子上气符 前部。有些人的甲状腺清楚可见。,"The thyroid gland, which is nestled just in front of the trachea in your neck， can be seen in some folks."
7643,使用抗多巴胺能的药物如氯丙嗪 (chlorpromazine)疗法中，常可见到轻度的髙泌乳素血症。,A common cause of mild hyperprolactinaemia is therapy with antidopaminergic agents such as chlorpromazine.
7643,但是，这些青少年多数 虽然没有月经初潮或发生继发性的闭经，存在着某些青春期的发育。,"In most cases, however, these adolescents will show some pubertal development, although they may not attain menarche or may have secondary amenorrhoea."
7643,库兴氏病 (Cushing ’s disease)和甲状腺机能低下(hypothyroidism)都被列人性发育缺失的青春期发育延迟的原因仅延缓性的发育或延长月经初潮前的时间。,Both Cushing's disease and hypothyroidism are listed as causes of delayed adolescence without sexual development.More often they merely delay sexual development or prolong the time before menarche.
7644,研究表明提高钾的摄入量能够减少某种形式的动脉老化的发生。,Studies have shown that increased potassium intake can decrease the incidence of some forms of arterial aging.
7644,钾是一种电解质，即一种保证适当的细胞功能的带电微粒。,Potassium is anelectrolyte-an electrically charged particle needed for proper cellular functioning.
7644,钾尤其有助于携带电荷以帮 助神经或肌肉收缩，还能协助调整血压，使心脏和肾脏工作正常（每天吃相当三根香蕉的钾可以使你的生理年龄年轻0.6岁之多）。,"Potassium specifically helps in carrying an electrical charge to help a nerve or muscle contract, and it helps regulate blood pressure and allow the heart and kidneys to  function properly.(Adding the potassium equivalent of three bananas a day can make your Real Age as much as 0.6 years younger.)"
7645,假设（hypothesis)指的是预期的结果。,The hypothesis is the expected result.
7645,当研究者准备进行一项研究时，通常对可能得到的结果已经有想法。,A person setting out to conduct a study generally has an idea as to what the outcome will be.
7645,这种问题的预期处理方式可能是依据理论的构念、先前相关研究的结果、或实验者过去的经验与观察。,"This anticipated solution to the problem may be based on some theoretical construct, on the results of previous studies, or perhaps on the experimenter’s experience and observations."
7645,由于先前已讨论过以非科学的方法取得知识之缺点，因此最后一项来源可能性较低或较不容易有说服力。,The last source is probably least likely or defensible because of the weaknesses of the unscientific methods of acquiring knowledge discussed previously.
7646,当研究者想要了解与记录某一些特定间隔时段里，是否有发生所欲观察的一些问题行为时所采用的记录方式，就称为间 隔法（interval method) 。,The interval method is used when the researcher wishes to record whether the behavior in question occurs in a certain interval of time.
7646,当个别事件或问题行为的发生较难计数时，这种方式是很有用的。,This method is useful when counting individual occurrences is difficult.
7646,"在间隔法中，有一个具有领先地位的标准化系统就是Handers交互作用分析系统工具（ Flanders’ Interaction Analysis System ) (Flanders, 1970)，观察者根据每个间隔内10个具体行为分类记录学生的行为。","One of the leading standardized systems for interval recording is the Flanders’ Interaction Analysis System (Flanders, 1970), in which the observer records the behavior of the student according to 10 specific behavior classifications within each time interval."
7647,目前，已经发表了内容广泛的MET值表（Ainsworth et al.，1993)。,"Recently, an extensive list of MET values has been published (Ainsworth et al., 1993)."
7647,该表的大多数数据是用间接热量测定法得到的实际数值。,Much of the data in this list are derived from actual measurements by indirect calorimetry.
7647,但是，在数据缺乏时，数值是依据经验推算出来的。,"However, when data were not available the figures were based upon educated guesses."
7647,某些活动的数值不是从实际活动时得来的。,
7648,对任何开始练习深蹲的人来说，肩倒立深蹲都是完美的起点。,Shoulderstand squats are the perfect preliminary exercise for anybody who wants to start squatting.
7648,由于做该动作时身体处于倒立姿势，所以膝盖和下背部无需承受身体的重量，这就使得该动作成为一个理想的恢复性训练动作——可以帮助那些背部和膝盖有伤的健身者，或是刚做完手术正处于恢复期的健身者重新开始腿部训练。,"Due to the inverse position of the body, there is virtually no weight going through the knees and lower back.This makes them an ideal rehabilitation exercise to help those with back or knee injuries—perhaps coming out of surgery—to get back into sports where leg motion is crucial."
7648,从力量角度来说，做肩倒立其实对健身者上身的要求更高。,"In strength terms, shoulderstand squats are in fact harder on the upper body than the lower body."
7648,但是这一动作能让紧绷的关节放松，增加关节的活动幅度，从而能让初学者为练就完美的深蹲打下基础。,"But they do free up tight joints, increase range of motion and set beginners on the road to perfect form."
7649,标准化的人体测量技术是很容易被忽略的。,Standardized anthropometry is an elusive goal.
7649,不可以将名称相似的技术看做是同一个技术。,Similarly named techniques cannot be assumed to be identical.
7649,"例如国际生物学计划 (International Biological Programme, IBP)测量肩峰间距的方法是“当双肩向前成圆形时”进行的，所测到的数据比本章提倡的经典技术（受试者取站立位）要大些。","For example, the International Biological Programme (IBP) method for obtaining biacromial breadth 'when the shoulders are rounded forward' (Weiner & Lourie, 1981) is systematically larger than the classical technique advocated in this chapter where the subject stands erect."
7650,建立题库是创造大量题目的资料库。这些题目可以用来建立在估计潜在特质时，具备特定精确度特征的测验。,Item banking is the creation of large pools of test items that can be used for constructing tests that have certain characteristics concerning the precision of estimating latent ability.
7650,适性测验，有时又称为客制化测验，是指选择最合适每个人能力程度的题目（既不会太难也不会太简单）。,"Adaptive testing, sometimes called tailored testing, refers to selecting items that best fit (are neither too difficult nor too easy for) the ability level of each person."
7651,最后，必须将一般的力量训练和参加竞技运动和奥林匹克的举重严格区别开来。,"Lastly, a distinction must be made between strength training and participation in the sports of competitive and Olympic weight-lifting and power-lifting."
7651,如果在监督下，有正确的技术指导和对负荷的恰当选择，力量训练对于大多数儿童而言是一种快乐的、风险相对低的活动。,Strength training if done under supervision and with appropriate technique instruction and prescription of loads can be an enjoyable and relatively low risk activity for most children.
7651,"但是，像竞技性的奥林匹克的举重、大力举、健美运动（body building)对儿童可能是风险较高的活动，根据一些专业团体的规定，不宜向儿童推荐（American Academy of Pediatrics, 1990; American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine 见 Cahill, 1988)。","Competitive and Olympic weight-lifting, power-lifting and body building however, may prove riskier activities for children, and according to some professional bodies should not be recommended for preadolescents (American Academ y of Pediatrics, 1990; American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine — see Cahill, 1988)."
7652,健身球锻炼——以前，想要锻炼腰部的训练者往往会严重依赖健身球，但这个动作也几乎像恐龙一样灭绝了。,"Medicine Ball Work—In the old days, athletes used to rely heavily on the medicine ball to train their waists, but this has largely gone the way of the dinosaur."
7652,真可惜！其实投和接重球的动作能够锻炼所有的中段内部肌肉，比如膈肌和腹横肌。,"It’s a shame, because throwing and catching a heavy ball works all the internal muscles of the midsection, like the diaphragm and transversus."
7652,该动作会强迫腹肌快速有力地收缩，就像摔倒或受到撞击时，腹肌要快速收缩以保护内脏那样。,It forces the abs to contract quickly and powerfully in the way they need to fire when bracing for a fall or protecting the internal organs from a stout punch.
7652,不过，你无需真正的健身球，如果你投掷时足够用力，篮球就可以了。,"You don’t need a heavy authentic medicine ball, a basketball will do if you throw it hard enough."
7652,你甚至都不需要训练伙伴，只要将球投向一堵墙，在其反弹回来时将其抓住即可。,You don’t even require a training partner—you can just shoot that sucker at a wall and catch it on the rebound.
7653,在第十一章身体智慧这一章，我试着向你传授一点儿有用的健身哲学，这些都是基于我多年的经验而成。,"In chapter 11: Body Wisdom, I try to pass on some of the useful training philosophy I’ve garnered over the years."
7653,在有些问题上，我也会给你一些建议，从如何合理热身到如何不使用药物就获得进步。,I’ll give you tips on subjects ranging from proper warm up protocols to the best way to make real and permanent progress as a drug-free strength athlete.
7653,这一章的知识与策略可以使你免于浪费数年努力进行毫无成效的锻炼。,The approaches and strategies  in this chapter could save you years of wasted efforts and yo-yo training.
7654,7. B:有数据表明，要防治动脉血管疾病和癌症，两片或两片以上的幼儿用阿司匹林与一整片普通阿司匹林效果相同。,7. B: The data show that you get as much benefit for preventing arterial disease and cancer from two or more baby aspirins as from a full aspirin.
7654,防治动脉疾病，两片幼儿用阿司匹林比一片效果高两倍以上。,And two baby aspirins are more than twice as good at preventing arterial disease as is one baby aspirin.
7654,8.B: 当你连有关阿尔茨海默病的最新信息也忘记的时候，健忘的情况就非常明显了，你都意识不到自己已经忘了。,"8. B: While you forget recent information with Alzheimer's, the forgetfulness is so profound that you can't recognize that you forgot."
7655,心脏就像你家一样，也有“门厅”——心房，储存流入心脏的血液。,"Now just like your house, your heart also has an atrium, which holds the blood coming into the heart."
7655,当这种相对不太重要的房间发生纤维性颤动时，人们会感到心悸。,"When fibrillation happens in this less critical chamber, folks feel palpitations."
7655,与需要植入AICD的心脏病人不同，这种患者有时需要用其他方法治疗，比如植入起搏器、射频消溶手术或服用药品，药物治疗包括服用降低血液黏度的药品，能够防止不断运动的心房壁上因凝血累积而引发中风。,"Instead of an AICD, these people sometimes need minimally invasive procedures like a pacemaker insertion, ablation, or medications including a blood thinner to prevent blood clots that accumulate on the quivering atrial walls and can cause strokes."
7656,肾上腺也分泌降肾上腺素和肾上腺素。当你激动时，这两种物质的分泌水平就会上升。,"Your adrenal glands also produce norepinephrine and epinephrine, levels of which rise when you get excited."
7656,在正常的口常生活中，肾上腺素的水平维持在每毫升200至800毫微克（十亿分之一克）。,"In normal daily life, your levels of epinephrine hover between 200 to 800 nanograms per milliliter."
7656,你一定了解那种感觉，就是当你险些遇上车祸时，你会感到脸红、心跳，其至咒骂那些不长眼睛的并道行驶司机。,"You know that feeling when you narrowly avoid a car accident—when your face feels flushed, your heart races, and you swear at the incompetence of no-look mergers?"
7657,"范登堡等 (Vandenburgh et al., 1989)在覆盖有胶原蛋白的培养基上培养鸟骨骼肌时也证实了这一现象的存在。",Vandenburgh et al. (1989) also demonstrated this phenomenon using avian skeletal myoblasts grown on collagen-coated medium.
7657,机械牵拉会引起蛋白质生成的增加。,Mechanical stretch led to an increase in protein production.
7657,值得注意的是，若培养基中不含生长因子，则肌细胞的生长明显减慢。这促使研究者得出以下的结论，机械作用刺激细胞生长是依赖这些生长因子的作用。,It is noteworthy that muscle cell growth was significantly reduced in basal medium without growth factors prompting the authors to comment that mechanically stimulated cell growth was dependent on these growth factors.
7658,有点令人不解的是，为什么人们认为训练会影响女孩而不是男孩的性发育成熟。,It is somewhat puzzling why one would expect training to influence the sexual maturation of girls and not of boys.
7658,对于男孩和女孩来说，引起性发育成熟的基本神经的内分泌过程大致相同，其他和体育有关的环境压力如焦虑和睡眠， 都同样会影响女孩和男孩。,"Underlying neuroendocrine processes that trigger sexual maturation are generally similar, and other environmental stresses related to sport, such as anxiety and sleep, undoubtedly affect boys as well as girls."
7658,然而，除了摔跤，也许还有柔道和空手道外，男孩参加的运动的特征之一是不必过分强调控制体重的。,"However, with the exception of wrestling and perhaps judo and karate, emphasis on extreme weight regulation is not characteristic of sports for boys."
7659,回流其实是进化的最大恩赐之一。,Regurgitation is actually one of evolution's greatest gifts.
7659,回流引起的反胃、呕吐保护了我们。,That ability to regurgitate protects us.
7659,看看马吧，马不会呕吐，所以当它们吃了有毒的东西后，就无法将毒物排出体外。,"Horses, for instance, can't vomit, so when they eat poisonous stuff, they can't get it out of their system."
7659,这就带来了绞痛，或者说是由消化道受损引起的剧烈腹痛。绞痛是马死亡的主要原因。,That promotes a condition called colic—or severe abdominal pain caused by trauma in the digestive tract—and that's the leading cause of equine deaths.
7660,这与前交叉是相同的脚步动作，但它更有挑战性。,"This is the same foot action as the cross in front, but it is much more aggressive."
7660,之前的练习是一个快速脚步训练，这个练习才是真正的变向训练。,"Where the previous drill is a quick-foot drill, this one is a real change-of-direction drill."
7660,在进行高难度交叉步练习时，我们提示用内侧的腿非常用力地蹬地，非常鼓励运动员向绳梯倾斜。,"In the hard cross-over we cue a really aggressive push-off with the inside leg, really encouraging the athlete to lean into the ladder."
7660,落地是非常积极主动地双脚落地停止，因此它不是1-2-3的节奏，它更偏向于一个两拍训练。,"The landing is a very aggressive stop in a two-foot base position, so rather than a 1-2-3 rhythm it is more of a two-count drill."
7660,该动作是向绳梯倾斜，内侧腿用力蹬地，跨进绳梯，双脚在另一侧稳健地落地。,"The action is lean into the ladder, push hard with the inside leg to cross into the ladder, and land solid on two feet on the opposite side."
7660,落地时应该模仿溜冰者的停止动作或双脚滑垒式移动的动作。,The landing should mimic a skater’s stop or the action of a two-foot baseball slide.
7661,麦肯齐训练跑者练习提脚动作，尽可能短时间接触地面。,MacKenzie drills runners to practice a foot pull that spends as little time as possible on the ground.
7661,跑者们的目标是落地轻，并做到几乎没有落地声音。,His runners aim to touch down with a light sort of tap that creates little or no sound.
7661,脚步接触地面的时间越短，越会减少脚部向内过度翻转产生的麻烦，也就是所说的‘足内翻’。,"The theory is that with less time spent on the ground, the foot has less time to get into the kind of trouble caused by the sheering forces of excessive inward foot rolling, known as “overpronation.”"
7662,其次，年轻运动员是一个经过充分筛选的人群，在筛选过程中不仅考虑了技术和运动能力水平，还考虑了运动员的身材大小和体形。,"Second, young athletes are a highly selected group not only with regard to skill and performance level but also with regard to size and physique."
7662,这种选择有可能是由运动员本人、家长、教练员、有影响的其他人或由这些人共同决定的。,"The selection may be made by the individual, parents, coach, influential others or some combination of these."
7662,而且，提早发育本身就与生长有关，而二者又都与运动能力联系着的。,"Further, earlier maturation is intrinsically related to growth in size and both are associated with performance."
7663,"本能的动作，如吮吸动作就可以在未满月婴儿睡眠状态下看到（Wolff,1966)。","Spontaneous movement patterns, such as mouthing, can be observed in neonates in a drowsy state (Wolff, 1966)."
7663,这种动作常常是有节奏性的，被称为节奏定型动作（rhythmical stereotypies)。,"They are often hythmical, in which case they are called rhythmical stereotypies."
7663,"婴儿在1岁期间表现出大量的节奏定型动作，诸如踢腿、身体波浪运动、身体弯曲、身体摇摆、跳跃等等（Wolff,1968;Thelen，1981）。","During their first year, infants perform a great variety of stereotypies, such as kicking, waving, banging, rocking, bouncing, and so on (Wolff, 1968; Thelen, 1981)."
7664,纤维是人体排污管道的神奇养料，目前我们还不能证明纤维可以预防结肠癌。,"While fiber is the wonder nutrient for your tubing, it hasn't been shown to prevent colon cancer."
7664,每天服用两小片阿司匹林，可以将结肠癌发病率降低40%，而服用大剂量的叶酸和（或）钙，结肠癌发病率会降低30%。,You can reduce the chances of getting colon cancer by 40 percent by taking two baby aspirins a day and by 30 percent by taking high doses of folate and/or calcium.
7664,不过最好的预防方法还要包括定期接受结肠镜检査，观察是否有早期癌变特征的息肉，并要定期做粪便潜血检査。,But the best prevention also includes a regular colonoscopy to check for precancerous polyps and to check your stool regularly for blood.
7665,传说罗马皇帝尼禄能借助一枚绿宝石聚焦，观察角斗士的格斗。人们认为这是最先发明的眼镜之一。,"It’s said that Nero would look through an emerald to help focus on gladiator fights, and that’s thought to have been one of the first inventions of eyeglasses."
7665,眼部的屈光问题造成的近视（你只能看见近处的东西）或是远视（你只能看见远处的东西）是因为光线在进入眼睛的过程中出了问题。,"Simply, refractive problems like nearsightedness (when you can see only close things) or farsightedness (when you can see only faraway things)—stem from that process where light comes in."
7666,手（茎突间线到指尖长度）。,Hand (mid-stylion line to dactylion length).
7666,从茎突间线到第三指尖的最短距离。,Shortest distance from the mid-stylion line to the dactylion III.
7666,受试者将右手伸展，手掌向上，手指完全伸直。,"The subject extends the right hand supinated (palms up), fully extending the fingers."
7666,将指示器末端放在茎突间线上，用右手将指示器的外鞘指针放在受试者中指的最远端皮肤上。,"Place the end pointer on the marked mid-stylion line and apply the housing pointer held in your right hand to the subject's dactylion, the most distal point on the fleshy surface of the third digit."
7667,手（茎突间线-中指尖长度）。,Hand (mid-stylion line-dactylion length)）.
7667,从茎突间线到第三指尖的最短距离。,Shortest distance from the mid-stylion line to the dactylion III.
7667,受试者将右手伸展，手掌向上，手指完全伸直。,"The subject extends the right hand supinated (palms up), fully extending the fingers."
7667,将指示器末端放在茎突间线上，用右手将指示器的外鞘指针放在受试者中指的最远端皮肤上。,"Place the end pointer on the marked mid-stylion line and apply the housing pointer held in your right hand to the subject's dactylion, the most distal point on the fleshy surface of the third digit."
7668,精神疾病既受化学因素影响，也受环境因素影响。抑郁症一方面是由于化学物质发生问题而引起的，另一方面也受到情感方面的影响。,"Mental illness is both chemical and environmental—as much as it is a chemical problem, there's also an emotional basis of depression."
7668,实际上，人脑扫描表明抑郁的情绪位于脑部负责处理情感的部分。,"In fact, brain scans show that depression is localized to the parts of the brain that deal with emotion."
7668,我们经常会询问医生，精神疾病有多大程度受心理因素影响，又有多大程度受脑部化学物质状况影响？,We’re often asked how much of mental illness comes from psychological factors and how much comes from brain chemistry.
7668,医生们大多会如此回答：“两者都会产生百分之百的影响。,Many doctors answer one hundred percent of both.
7668,”,”
7669,Paul向我介绍了一个我以前从来没有过的想法——精神节奏。,Paul introduced me to an idea I hadn’t thought of before—mental pacing.
7669,“就像你必须调节你的体能，不能在比赛中太早地力竭一样，你也必须保护你的精力。你只有那么多的生理和心理储备。比赛的最后将是艰难的。你必须有足够的坚韧不拔的精神去克服困难。,"“Just like you have to regulate your physical effort to not become exhausted too early in a race, you have to conserve your mental effort. You only have so many physical and mental reserves. The end of the race will be tough. You have to have enough mental toughness left to push hard. That means staying really relaxed early on.”"
7669,这意味着赛程的前期要保持真正的放松。,
7669,”,
7670,那么学习这些动作需要多长时间呢？,How long will it take to learn the movements?
7670,根据年龄、运动背景、灵活性、受伤史等问题，这个过程大约需要一个月，或者也许几个月。,"Depending on age, athletic background, mobility issues, and injury history, among other factors, this may take just a month.Or it may take a number of months."
7670,当你第一次尝试火箭推（一个单独的爆发力动作，组合了颈前深蹲和过顶推举）、过顶深蹲或者严格的引体向上（体操运动员标准的全身引体向上）动作时，你也许会觉得力不从心。,"The first time you try a thruster (a taxing combination of a front squat and overhead press into a single, explosive movement), an overhead squat, or a kipping pull-up (pull-ups with a gymnast’s full-body kip move), you might think you’re in over your head."
7670,反正我开始也是这么认为的。,"That’s what I thought, anyway."
7670,但是如果你保持谦虚、耐心和坚持的态度，你会惊喜地发现身体的改变。,"But if you remain humble, patient, and consistent, you will be surprised at how well your body responds."
7671,颈围。,Neck girth.
7671,喉结上方的颈部围度。,Perimeter of the neck taken immediately superior to the larynx (Adam's apple).
7671,当受试者的头定位在法兰克福平面上时，取坐位的受试者的颈部长轴要与卷尺呈直角。,The tape is located perpendicular to the long axis of the neck of the seated subject when his head is oriented in the Frankfort plane.
7671,在卷尺上只施加轻微的压力。,The usual light anthropometric touch is applied to the tape.
7672,患骨软骨病的儿童，如奥-施氏病（胚骨粗隆骨软骨病）、朔伊尔曼氏病（脊柱骨软骨病）、潘纳尔氏病（青年崎形性跖趾骨软骨炎）、股骨头骨骺骨软骨病，可能会因为不同原因就诊。,"Children with osteochondroses, e.g.Osgood-Schlatter disease, Scheuermann's disease, Partner's disease and Legg-Calvé--Perthes disease, may have different reasons for seeking health care."
7672,每一种综合征均可能在运动时产生疼痛。,One symptom can be pain associated with sports activity.
7672,在此种情形下，体育运动可能不仅仅是发生疼 痛的原因，而更可能是诱因。,"In such circumstances, sports activities are presumably not the cause but, rather, the provocative factor."
7673,另外一个常见的功能性杂音是静脉的哼鸣声（venous hum）。,Another common functional murmur is the venous hum.
7673,该杂音的特点是一种连续的吹风样杂音，在右侧或左侧锁骨上和锁骨下区域听得最清楚。,This murmur is characterized as a continuous rather blowing murmur best heard in the right or left supra-and infraclavicular areas.
7673,当被检者取坐位时，该杂音听得最清楚，而当被检者仰卧时或通常无法听到该杂音，或者采取各种方法组织静脉血液从颈部回流到心脏（如轻轻压迫颈静脉）时杂音就消失了。,This murmur is best appreciated when the individual is sitting and generally is inaudible when the individual is supine or becomes inaudible with various manipulations that obstruct the return of venous blood from the neck to the heart (gentle external jugular compression).
7674,因此，自尊是一个社会性结构， 受到个体如何评价别人对自己的看法的影响。,"Consequently, self-esteem is a social construction susceptible to how individuals appraise the views of others about the self."
7674,"这种观点源于库利（Cooley, 1902) 提出的“镜像自我” （“ looking -glass self”），也就是人们通过其他人来认识自己。",This idea stems from Cooley (1902) who coined the phrase 'looking-glass self' suggesting that individuals come to see themselves through others.
7674,我们可以想象，一个人可以通过选择 与欣赏自己的人进行交往，从而保护自己的自尊，因此一个人的价值观可以反映他对周围其他人对自己积极评价的觉察程度。,"Conceivably, selfesteem could be protected by an individual surrounding him self or herself with select people who appear to view the individual favourably, so that one's personal evaluation of worth would reflect the perceived positive evaluation of others."
7675,另一方面，纪录片展开了细井的救赎舞台。,"On the other hand, the documentary developed Hosoi's redemption stage."
7675,首先，是细井的女朋友珍妮弗•李（Jennifer Lee)在帮助他转变的过程中所起到的作用。,"First, the role of Hosoi's girlfriend, Jennifer Lee, in initiating his conversion was addressed."
7675,在服刑期间，他信仰了基督，并和珍妮弗结婚（Freedman & Montano，2006)。,"While serving his time, he converted to Christianity and he and Lee were also married (Freedman & Montano, 2006)."
7676,切鲁迪认为，许多长跑运动员最主要的薄弱点在于缺乏上肢力量和高质量的跑步训练。,Cerutty believed that a major weakness for many distance runners was lack of upper-body strength as well as a lack of focus on quality running.
7676,切鲁迪指导的跑者要进行一周两次的举重训练、体操训练和不同配速的跑步训练。埃米尔•扎托贝克于1922年出生于捷克斯洛伐克。,"Runners in Cerutty’s program were directed to do intense weight lifting twice a week, perform gymnastics, and run at different paces.EMIL ZÁTOPEK was born in 1922 in Czechoslovakia."
7676,16岁时他就辍学了，开始在一家鞋厂工作。,"By age 16, he was done with school and working in a shoe factory."
7676,某次参加工厂1.6千米跑步比赛时，他惊讶地发现自己居然拿了第二名，从那时起他便爱上了跑步。,"When he was chosen to run a 1-mile factory race, he surprised himself by coming in second, and he caught the running bug."
7677,你身体里的细胞有点像你的味蕾，它们会准确知道自己喜欢什么，不喜欢什么。,Your body s cells are a little like your taste buds in that they know exactly what they like and what they don't.
7677,当免疫系统遇到葡萄状球菌时，你的身体把它当作一种外来物质，就像一个门卫在监视屏幕上注意到一个不受欢迎的入侵者。,"When it encounters staphylococcus, your body rec-ognizes it as a foreign substance, just as a guard would notice an unwanted intruder on a surveillance camera."
7677,当你的身体发现入侵者，一种白 色的血细胞——巨噬细胞就会发现并吞下细菌，将其消化掉，就像负贵安全的门卫阻止并质问外来者的方式。,"When your body spots the intruder, a type of white blood cell—called a macrophage finds the bacteria, engulfs it, and digests it, sort of like the way the security guard would stop and question that intruder."
7678,决定系数( coefficient of determination，又称r2)是最常用来诠释相关系数所代表的意义的效标。,The most commonly used criterion for interpreting the meaningfulness of the correlation coefficient is the coefficient of determination (r2).
7678,透过此方法，得以了解影响两个变项的常见因素之间关联性的部分。,"In this method, the portion of common association of the factors that influence the two variables is determined."
7678,换句话说，决定系数代表能够透过一个测量方法的变异量(variance) 来解释或了解另一个测量方法中总变异量的部分。,"In other words, the coefficient of determination indicates the portion of the total variance in one measure that can be explained, or accounted for, by the variance in the other measure."
7679,在绝经后，女性的骨密度也会降低，因为有助于钙质累积的雌性激素此时分泌量减少。,"Women also lose bone density after menopause, since they lose some estrogen, which is paramount in helping deposit calcium."
7679,不过男性稍后的骨质疏松发病率也就和女性并驾齐驱了。男性一到75岁，雄性激素和窖丸激累分泌量普遍下降，不足以维持骨骼的密度和质璗。,"But men “catch up” later; as they reach seventy-five, they lack both the mass and sufficient estrogen and testosterone to help build bone."
7680,军体俯卧撑与折刀俯卧撑的起始姿势相同——弯腰，髋部撅起，双臂与双腿几乎伸直。,"In diagonal pushups, get into same the bent-over pushup position used to begin jackknife pushups.Your body should be bent well at the waist, with the hips high in the air, and your arms and legs almost straight."
7680,双腿要并拢，这会增加动作的难度。,Keeping the legs together will make things harder.
7680,弯曲手臂，肩部下沉，但做该动作时髋部并不像折刀俯卧撑或俯冲轰炸机那样紧贴地面，而是始终在空中成直角。,"Now bend at the arms and shoulders, but instead of dropping your hips—as you would for jackknife or divebomber pushups—keep your body locked at a ninety-degree angle."
7680,前额轻触地面，然后将自己推回到起始姿势。,"Keep bending your arms until the top of your forehead gently touches the floor, and push back up."
7680,注意，髋部的角度始终不变，直到完成所有反复次数。如果用脚跟抵住墙角，这个动作会更容易一些。,The body must stay at the same angle until you finish all your reps. It’s easier to do this if your heels are jammed up against a wall.
7680,与标准俯卧撑相比，该动作能更好地锻炼肩部。,This exercise works the shoulders more than the conventional pushup.
7680,这个动作做起来很有趣，但与下斜俯卧撑一样，如果你想更好地锻炼肩部，那么倒立撑是更好的选择。,"It’s fun to do, but just like decline pushups, the handstand pushup is a far better alternative if you want to work your shoulders hard."
7681,在主要降压药中，需要考虑的是P-阻滞剂，钙通道阻滞剂，血管紧张素转换酶 (ACE)抑制剂和利尿剂。,"The major antihypertensive drug classes which require consideration are P-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and diuretics."
7681,虽然在同类降压药中存在一些差别，但因篇幅所限，无法进行详细讨论。,"Although some differences exist between antihypertensive drugs within the same class, the scope of this discussion does not allow for a detailed description."
7681,故仅对各类药物进行概述。,An overall view of the drug class only will be presented.
7682,在性发育的任何年龄阶段都能发生过早绝经。,Premature menopause may occur at any age or stage of sexual development.
7682,虽然这时主要表现的是继发性闭经（见后），但是偶尔也会发生原发性闭经。,"Although this presents mainly as secondary amenorrhoea (see below), occasionally primary amenorrhoea may be the presenting complaint."
7682,这种病因可能包括循环中的抗卵巢抗体（antiovarian antibodies)所致。它可以是稀有的单独的疾病，也可以是更加常见的抗内分泌组织自我免疫综合征（阿狄森氏病，即肾上腺性青铜色皮病，Addison's disease)的一个扩张型综合征 (expanded syndrome)。,"The patho­ genesis may include circulating antiovarian antibodies, either as a rare singular entity or more commonly as part of an expanded syndrome of antiendocrine tissue autoimmune syndrome (e.g.Addison's disease)."
7683,既然溃疡是由细菌感染引起的，那么病人就会把细菌传播给其他人。,"If the ulcer is caused by a bacterial infection, you can pass the bacteria to other people you're living with."
7683,通过接吻，细菌会在情侶间传来传去，而只有两个人都接受治疗，才能彻底摆脱溃疡的困扰。,"Through kissing, you can ping-pong the bacteria forth between you and your partner, and you'll never get rid of it until you're both treated."
7683,尽管我们可以用抗生素成功地治愈由幽口螺旋杆菌引起的溃疡，但是更大的担忧仍然存在：溃疡还可能是胃癌的前兆。,"Though ulcers caused by H. pylori can be treated successfullywith antibiotics, the worry is that ulcers can also be harbingers of gastric cancer."
7684,骨关节炎只是关节炎的一种。,"For the record, osteoarthritis is only one kind of arthritis."
7684,关节炎是涵盖了所有关节炎症的一个广义名词。,Arthritis is the broad name given to any inflammatory joint disease.
7684,风湿性关节炎和其他种类的关节炎与年龄增长无关，而是一种免疫系统的自我紊乱，人体自身抗体攻击软骨，引起发炎及关节疼痛。,"Rheumatoid and some other forms of arthritis are not diseases associated with aging but rather autoimmune disorders, in which antibodies attack your cartilage, which is what triggers that inflammation and joint pain."
7685,每日补充31亳克的类黄酮化合物。,Get 31 milligrams of flavonoids a day.
7685,类黄酮化合物是有效的抗氧化剂和消炎物质。植物类食品（包括坚果）中含有这种物质，如茶类（含绿茶）、红葡萄酒、葡萄、酸萄栗、100%纯天然橙汁、洋葱、西红柿及西红柿计。,"Flavonoids are powerful antioxidants and anti-inflammatory substances that occur in certain plant foods, including nuts; any tea, including green tea; red wine; grapes; cranberries; 100 percent natural orange juice; onions; and tomatoes and tomato juice."
7685,通过每日饮用两杯半酸梅果计或几杯茶，可以补充到足量的类黄酮化合物。,You can take in this amount by drinking two and a half glasses of cranberry juice or several cups or glasses of tea.
7686,常常我们会因为从不同的角度来评量以往已经发表过的资料而产生新的见解。,"frequently, new insights may be gained by evaluating previously reported data from a different perspective."
7686,"然而,不管是否由原作者或其他人著手再分析，这种类型的报告总是被归类为研究注记。","However, reports of this type are always classed as research notes whether the reanalysis is undertaken by the original author or someone else."
7686,这并不意味著从大量的研究中所使用的数据的报告(如统合分析、考验力分析)会被归类为研究注记。,"This does not mean that reports which use data from a number of studies (e.g., meta-analyses, power analyses) are classed as research notes."
7687,找一面墙，双手手掌平放在距离墙根约15到25厘米的地面上，双手与肩同宽。,"Approach a solid wall.Place your palms flat on the floor six to ten inches from the base of the wall, at about shoulder width apart."
7687,手臂伸直或近乎伸直，膝盖弯曲，撑起身体。,"Your arms should be straight, or nearly so.Bend at the knees, bracing the whole body."
7687,提起一条腿的膝盖，让其靠近同侧的肘部（图111），然后使劲向下蹬地，同时让另一条腿向后上方摆。,"Bring the knee of your strongest leg up towards the corresponding elbow (fig.111) and push down hard with that leg, kicking back and up with the other leg."
7687,与此同时，让蹬地的腿也离地，紧随另一条腿向墙壁靠近，手臂保持伸展，双脚脚跟应同时接触墙壁。,"As you rise, allow the foot of your strongest leg to leave the floor and follow your other leg as it approaches the wall.Keep your arms extended.The heels of both your feet should touch the wall at the same time."
7687,刚开始练习时，上踢的力量如果过大，你的后背和屁股会猛地撞到墙上，但久而久之你就会掌握完美的上墙技艺。,"At first your back and butt may also slam into the wall as you overestimate the power required to kick up, but over time you’ll learn the art of finding the wall perfectly."
7687,最后，你的手臂应该是直的，身体摆正，背部略向内弓。,At this point your arms should be straight and your body aligned with a slight arch towards the wall.
7687,这就是标准的靠墙倒立姿势（图112）。,This is the position for the wall handstand technique (fig. 112).
7688,做靠墙顶立时，找一堵墙，在墙根处放置一个枕头（坐垫或叠好的毛巾也可）。,"In the wall headstand, find a solid wall.Place a pillow, cushion or folded towel down by the base of the wall.This will be for your head."
7688,双手和双膝着地，将头顶在枕头上，头部距离墙壁约15到25厘米。,"Get on your hands and knees, and place the top of your head on the cushion.Your skull should be between six and ten inches from the wall."
7688,双手稳稳地放在头部两侧，大约与肩同宽。,"Set your palms down securely on either side of your head, about shoulder width apart."
7688,抬起一条腿的膝盖，让其靠近同侧的肘部，同时伸直另一条腿，使膝盖离地（图107）。,"Bring your strongest knee up close to your corresponding elbow, and straighten out your other leg so the knee is off the ground (fig. 107)."
7689,第1章旨在界定与回顾身体活动领域的各种研究类型与相关范例。,The introductory chapter defines and reviews the types of research done in physical activity and provides some examples.
7689,我们把科学界定为系统性的探究，并讨论科学方法的步骤。,"We define science as systematic inquiry, and we discuss the steps in the scientific method."
7689,透过这种逻辑的方法，可回答下列四个问题，而这四个问题的答案，正是硕博士论文和研究报告的章节或内容。,"This logical method answers the following four questions (Day, 1983, p. 4), which constitute the parts of a typical thesis, dissertation, or research report."
7690,搜集资料是以科学方法解决问题时的基础步骤。因此，了解基础的测量理论是必要的（我们要强调，虽然在此将测量视为研究工具，但测量本身也是一种研究领域）。,"A basic step in the scientific method of problem solving is the collection of data; therefore, an understanding of basic measurement theory is necessary.(We should point out that although measurement is discussed here as a research tool, measurement itself is an area of research.)"
7690,在本章中，我们将讨论一些基本准则，可用来评断研究数据测量结果的质量，就是所谓的效度与信度。,"In this chapter, we discuss fundamental criteria forjudging the quality of measures used in collecting research data: validity and reliability."
7690,我们会解释效度与信度的类型，以及建立效度与信度的方法（质性研究的可信度将在第1 9 章讨论）。,We explain types of validity and ways by which evidence of validity and reliability may be established.(The trustworthiness of qualitative research is discussed in chapter 19.)
7690,本章总结了一些与动作测量、纸笔书写反应测量、情绪行为、知识、以及项目反应理论有关的议题。,"We conclude with some issues concerning the measurement of movement, of written responses used in paper-and-pencil instruments, of affective behavior, of knowledge, and of item response theory."
7691,第二个评估质性研究的重要概念是可转换性（transferability)，它可以用来审酌研究结果是否在相似或其他不同环境中也能派上用场。,"Transferability, the second important concept in evaluating quality, addresses whether the results would be useful to those in other settings or conducting research in similar settings."
7691,这个概念或许让你想到概化，有些方面确实如此，但其他方面又不尽然。,"You may be thinking that this concept is like generalizability, and in some ways it is, but in other ways it is not."
7691,所有研究者都希望他们的研究能帮助他人，但像我们这领域中许多的量化研究一样，大范围母体中的随机抽样，对于大多数的质性研究并无助益。,"All researchers would like their research to help others, but like much of the quantitative research in our area, most qualitative research does not benefit from random selection from a large population."
7692,表面上看，空气过滤器似乎是自有潜水通气管以来对人体肺部最好的发明。,"On the surface, air filters sound as if they'd be the best things for your lungs since snorkeling tubes."
7692,人们认为空气过滤器的原理是通过滤去空气中的过敏物，让人呼吸得到更清洁的空气。,Air filters are supposed to work by taking allergens out of the air so you can have cleaner breathing.
7692,但是，许多空气过滤器工作得并没这么顺利，主要的原因不是技术上的问题，而是使用者的问题。,"But many of them don't work that well, and the primary reason isn't a mechanical malfunction but an owner malfunction."
7692,大多数人更换空气过滤器或空气加湿器的频率很不够，所以机器就并未有效工作。,"Most people don't change air filters or clean humidifiers with enough regularity, so they're not that effective."
7693,下面要谈的这个胃部问题与初次约会的失败联系紧密：有口臭。,The next stomach condition is the one most associated with failed first dates: bad breath.
7693,有时口臭源自口腔，这时只要检查牙齿和牙龈，就可以很容易找到问题所在。,"Sometimes bad breath originates from your mouth, and it's easy to check your teeth and gums for culprits."
7693,不过我们的口腔通常只是胃部所存秽气的出口。,But often your mouth is only the porthole for bad stomach odors.
7693,我们可以把口腔想成排污系统的主要开口。,Think of it as a sewer main breaking.
7693,也许你是在地上闻到气味，但问题实际出在地下。,"You may smell it aboveground, but the actual problem comes from underground."
7693,口臭也是同理。,It's the same with bad breath.
7693,严重的口臭通常是由于胃肠出了问题。,Severe bad breath—called halitosis—usually comes from your stomach and digestive problems.
7694,"库李的合理均等式(Kuder-Richardson [KR] method of rational equivalence) 以 KR-20 与 KR-21 这两个公式其中之一,来计算二分计分题型(例 如 :对或错)的内部一致性。","In the Kuder-Richardson (KR) method of rational equivalence, one of two formulas, known as KR-20 and KR-21, is used for items scored dichotomously (i.e., right or wrong)."
7694,"此方式只需要施 行一次测验,而且不需要计算相关。","Only one test administration is required, and no correlation is calculated."
7694,计算出的内部一致性系数代表所有可能的折半信度系数的平均。,The resulting coefficient represents an average of all possible split-half reliability coefficients.
7695,在夜晚，我们的身体需要两样东西（如果算上按摩，那就是三样了）。,"Your body needs two things during the night (three, if you count back massages)."
7695,人体需要快速动眼期睡眠和慢波睡眠。,"It needs REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, and it needs slow-wave sleep."
7695,为了实现快速动眼期睡眠，我们需要先有90分钟的持续睡眠。,"To get into REM sleep, you need about ninety minutes of consistent sleep."
7695,因此，假如你像典型的睡眠呼吸暂停综合征患者那样，每小时醒来10次，就绝对不会有快速动眼期睡眠，睡醒后也就不会有精力充沛的感觉。,"So if you're waking up ten times an hour, which is typical for people with sleep apnea, you’re never getting into REM and won’t wake up refreshed."
7696,宽范围的滑动夹子。,Wide sliding calipers.
7696,像罗斯和马尔费尔-琼斯 (1990)所介绍的，躯干和肢体宽度偶尔是用人体测量器进行测量的。,"Occasionally, torso and limb breaths are obtained using an anthropometer as described by Ross and Marfell-Jones (1990)."
7696,总而言之，Siber Hegner人体测量器的无关节末端用作宽范围夹子来测量躯干是不满意的。,The disarticulated end piece of the Siber Hegner anthropometer used as a wide sliding caliper for torso measurements is not altogether satisfactory.
7696,每当压力施加在其末端而不是夹子的双侧时，它容易卷曲起来。,It tends to bind when pressure is applied to the ends of the branches instead of along the sides.
7696,灰底黑字的标尺很难进行读数。,The black on grey scale is somewhat difficult to read.
7697,与窄距俯卧撑相反，做宽距俯卧撑时你不是让双手相触，而是让双手之间的距离比做标准俯卧撑时的更宽，达到肩宽的两倍。,"Wide pushups are the opposite of close pushups—instead of putting your hands together, you place them wider than usual, up to twice shoulder width."
7697,这个变式减轻了肱三头肌和肘关节的压力，但是给胸肌造成了更大压力（就在胸肌接触肩部的那一点上）。,This variation takes much of the stress off the triceps and elbow joint and places more pressure on the pectorals at the point where they meet the front of the shoulder.
7697,用外行话说就是锻炼胸部比锻炼肱三头肌更多。,"In layman’s terms, it works the chest more than the triceps."
7697,这个变式并不能提升你做俯卧撑的能力，因为胸部和上肢带肌本来就比肘部强壮，持续做这个练习只会强化这个差异而已。,"This type of pushup won’t make you much stronger at doing pushups, because the chest/shoulder girdle is normally already proportionately much stronger than the elbow joint; doing this exercise consistently will only enhance that differential."
7697,也就是说，如果你正在专门锻炼胸肌，那这个变式对你非常有用。,"That said, it’s a useful exercise to master if you are specializing on your pectorals."
7698,本书通过分析坠落体育英雄的形势带给我们一趟独特之旅。,This book takes us on a unique journey across the fallen sports hero terrain.
7698,本论文集的特色是网罗了全球范围内有关体育、传媒与文化研究重要的学者团队。,"Featured here is the work of an important group of scholars in sports, media, and cultural studies from around the globe."
7698,每个案例都带来一个理解体育明星、英雄和名流起起伏伏的独特的观测点。,"Each treatment brings a unique vantage point on understanding the rise and fall of the sports star, hero, and celebrity."
7698,我们从开篇的“框架篇章”就深人研究一些著名体育人物沉沦时的肮脏细节，是要提醒大家这些道德传奇显著的多样性和他们对公众意识的影响。,"From the ""framing chapters"" that open the volume to those that delve into the sometimes sordid details of a notable sporting figure's fall, we are reminded of the remarkable diversity of these moral sagas and their impact on public consciousness."
7699,从1980~1990年以来，进食和体重障碍问题成为了临床医学的一个主要课题。,Eating and weight disorders have become a major focus of clinical medicine since the 1980s and 1990s.
7699,"在进食和体重障碍中，从20世纪90年代以来神经性厌食症被认为是一个临床综合征，那时对该术语进行过详细的描述（Strober, 1986)。","Of the two prim ary eating and weight disorders, anorexia nervosa has been considered a clinical syndrome since the late nineteenth century, at which time the term was coined and described (Strober, 1986)."
7699,"神经性易饿症作为一个综合征于1976年最先被提出来的，虽然那时的作者们使用的是贪食-厌食症,以便与狂食，即易饿症和狂食-排泄综合征加以区分。","Bulimia nervosa, as a syndrome, was first introduced in 1976, although the authors used the term bulimarexia to differentiate between binge eating, i.e.bulimia, and the binge—purge syndrome ."
7700,做拉弓式时，两手抓住一根垂直于地面的栏杆，一手高度大约与脸部齐平，另一只手与胸部齐平。,"In the bow pull, grab hold of a single vertical bar with both hands.One hand should be approximately face level, the other chest level."
7700,两臂几乎伸直，肘部微微弯曲，身体与栏杆之间的距离大约是手臂长度的三分之二。,"Your arms should be nearly straight, but with a little bend at the elbow.As a result, your torso will be about two-thirds arm length from the bars."
7700,然后，让高处的手臂尽力推栏杆，低处的手臂则尽力拉栏杆，有点儿像拉弓射箭时的动作。,"Now, push as hard as you can with the higher arm, whilst simultaneously pulling with the lower arm.The sensation is a little like the beginning motion of pulling back on a bow as in archery."
7701,在狱中，囚徒借助囚室栏杆训练力量已有数百年的历史。,Convicts have been pulling on the bars of their cells to build strength for hundreds of years.
7701,如果你有足够的创意.什么可以用结结实实的栏杆让全身都获得静力训练。,"If you are creative, you can use solid bars to give yourself a full body isometric workout."
7701,你可能觉得很奇怪，栏杆竟然能够用来健身！我有一个旧本子，上面列出了可以借助栏杆进行的100余种健身技巧。,You might be surprised at what a versatile discipline bar pulling can be; I have a list of over a hundred bar pulling techniques in an old notebook somewhere.
7701,拉栏杆是训练背部的绝佳方法，我在此只描述几种最好的动作。,"Bar pulls are an excellent method for training the back, so I’ll limit myself here to a description of just one bar pulling workout for the back, consisting of a handfull of the best techniques."
7702,这个变式与标准俯卧撑很像，只不过双手要撑在位于身体两侧的、高于地面的物体上。,"This is the standard pushup, but performed with the hands on two raised objects on either side of the torso."
7702,你可以买专用的俯卧撑把手，不过使用椅子效果也一样。,"You can buy specially made pushup handles for this, but placing the palms on two chairs will have the same effect."
7702,双手放在平面（如地面）上做俯卧撑时，动作幅度会受到限制，身体下降到某一点时会受到地板的阻挡。而将双手撑在高于地面的物体上做俯卧撑，就意味着胸部可以降得更低。,"When you do pushups with your hands on a flat surface (like the floor), your range of motion is limited by that surface; but doing pushups with your hands on raised objects means you can lower your chest further than the point where it would normally be stopped by the floor."
7702,你可以根据自己的需要选择床、书桌、椅子等高度不同的支撑物。两脚的高度可以低于双手，可以与之持平，也可以比双手更高。,"The feet can either be below the hands, or level (or higher) through being put on a bed, desk, another chair, etc."
7702,我并不是拉伸俯卧撑的信徒，因为我觉得在阻力之下拉伸肌肉很痛苦。,I’m not a big believer in stretch pushups.
7702,这样做确实会增加锻炼之后的肌肉酸痛感，但这完全是因为肌肉组织发生了轻微创伤，并不意味着肌肉将变得更大或更结实。,"Stretching the muscles under resistance is painful, and does lead to increased soreness after the workout, but this is entirely due to microtrauma within the muscle tissue—it doesn’t mean the muscles will get bigger or stronger."
7702,拉伸肌肉并不能让你变得更壮硕或更有力。,Stretching muscles won’t increase your size or strength.
7702,如果你想使自己的胸大肌燃烧，那就做拉伸俯卧撑；如果你想让整个上半身都强壮有力，那就做我前面讲的十式，将拉伸俯卧撑抛到脑后吧!,"If you want to make your pecs burn, do stretch pushups.If you want all-over upper body muscle and might, work through the ten steps and give stretch pushups a miss."
7703,我们注意到有关衰老的第一处身体部位就是皮肤。,One of the first places we notice aging is in our skin.
7703,我们从皮肤皱纹、皮肤癌和老年斑中看到了衰老。,"We see aging in wrinkles, in skin cancer, in liver spots."
7703,总的来说，对身体内部有好处的也对外部皮肤同样有好处。在任何时候都用防晒霜来保护你的每一处皮肤，以及避免吸烟（一天吸10支烟会使脸部皱纹加巨）都会起到保护皮肤的作用。,"Generally, what's good for your inside is also good for your outside: protecting your skin with a 4 or more star UVA blocker and an SPF 45 on all exposed spots all the time and avoiding cigarettes (ten cigarettes a day can double facial lines)."
7704,当你深吸一口气时，横膈膜的大肌肉需要向下运动，才能将更多空气吸入肺中。,"To inhale deeply, you must move your huge diaphragm muscle down to suck air into the lungs."
7704,最好的吸气方法是：当开始吸气时，先鼓起肚子 。,This is best done by pushing out your belly when you start to breathe in.
7704,大多数人呼吸时只用到很小的肋间肌，通过提升肋骨骨架帮助呼吸，这样效率较低。,"Even though the much smaller intercostal muscles can help to a lesser degree by lifting the rib cage, most folks use only these muscles to breathe, which is very inefficient."
7705,类别选项设计（categorical response)往往只提供填答者两种选择，答案就只有「是」和「否」〃同意」和「不同意」等二项。,"Categorical responses offer the respondent only two choices.Usually, the responses are yes and no or agree and disagree."
7705,这种题目比较明显的限制就是填答者无法表达像「有时候」和「不一定」等意见。,An obvious limitation of categorical responses is the lack of other options such as sometimes or undecided.
7705,处理类别选项设计所收集到的答案虽然不会像量尺题目的费时，但却无法显示填答者对特定行为的同意强度或出现的频率。,Categorical responses do not require as much time to administer as scaled responses do but do not provide as much information about the respondent’s degree of agreement or the frequency of the behavior.
7706,最广泛出现在媒体报道中的一个说法是医学或是生理学上的原因：类固醇。,The explanation that appeared most widely in the coverage located a medical or physiological cause: steroids.
7706,这一解释将事件框架建构为一个“类固醇狂躁症”（roid rage)引发的悲剧，一次由滥用类固醇类药物导致的发狂。,"This framed the tragedy as a case of ""roid rage,"" a drug-induced frenzy associated with abusing steroids."
7706,摔角选手在竞技场外具有超侵略性（hyper-aggressive)的行为长期以来就与使用类固醇类药物紧紧联系在一起。,Stories of wrestlers' hyper-aggressive behavior outside the ring had long been connected with the use of steroids.
7707,许多人认为其中的有效成分，即造成这一惊人数字的成分，是番茄红素。这是一种类胡萝卜素，因其抗氧化机能而著名。,"Many believe that the active ingredient—the ingredient responsible for such astounding numbers is lycopene, a carotenoid known for its antioxidant properties."
7707,类胡萝卜素通过黏附在自由基（自由基会引起癌症）上，把它们聚集打包，好让它们集体被清理出身体，不再危害细胞和染色体而发挥其作用。,Carotenoids work by attaching to free radicals (which can be cancer-causing) and packaging them so they can be washed out of the body so they don't damage cells or chromosomes.
7708,糖尿病会让动脉血管病情恶化。不过糖尿病主要是一种遗传性疾病，在患有肥胖症的成人中比较常见。,Diabetes makes disease of the arteries worse but is primarily a genetic disease made more evident by obesity in adults.
7708,其他健康问题，如性功能障碍、皱纹和中风，像心脏病一样，它们主要都由动脉老化引起。,"The others—impotence, wrinkling of the skin, and strokes—are like heart attacks: They are primarily caused by the aging of your arteries."
7708,可可制成的纯巧克力对健康有益，因为它含有类黄酮化合物和较健康的脂肪。,The flavonoids and healthier fat in real cocoa-based chocolate make it healthy.
7709,每天应该至少吃一把坚果。,Eat at least one handful of nuts a day.
7709,坚果是健康脂肪和健康蛋白质的理想来源。坚果还富含类黄酮化合物，这是一种解毒剂。,"Nuts are an excellent source of both healthful fats and healthful protein; they also can be concentrated sources of flavonoids, an antioxidant."
7709,“爱荷华州保健调查”和三次其他调查表明，每日食用28克坚果，会使心脏病发生的几率减少20%至60%。,"In the Iowa Nurses Study and three other studies, one ounce of nuts a day decreased the incidence of heart disease between 20 and 60 percent."
7710,"骨软骨病的儿童，如奥-施氏病（Osgood-Schlatter Disease, 胚骨粗隆骨软骨病）、朔伊尔曼氏病 (Scheuermann’s disease,脊柱骨软骨病）、 潘纳尔氏病（Parmer’s disease,青年崎形 性跖趾骨软骨炎）、累-卡-佩三氏病 (Legg-Calve-Perthes disease),可能会因为不同原因就诊。","Children with osteochondroses, e.g.O sgood-Schlatter disease, Scheuerm ann's disease, Partner's disease and Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease, may have different reasons for seeking health care."
7710,"每一种综合征均可能在运动时产生疼痛（Pappas, 1989)。","One symptom can be pain associated with sports activity (Pappas, 1989)."
7710,在此种情形下，体育运动可能不仅仅是发生疼痛的原因，而更可能是诱因。,"In such circumstances, sports activities are presumably not the cause but, rather, the provocative factor."
7711,在制定训练计划和参加比赛时，要慎重考虑体温调节问题。,A critical consideration in the design of training programmes and during competition is thermo­regulation.
7711,"脊髓损伤时存在体 温调节不良（Bloomquist, 1986),体力活动、训练和（或）比赛可加重体温调节障碍。","Thermoregulatory dysfunction is a problem in SCI (Bloomquist, 1986) and may be exacerbated by physical activity, training and/ or competition."
7711,体温调节问题可出现在低温或高温时，甚至在相对湿度和温度适中时也会发生（10〜15.5T；或50-60 °F)。,Thermoregulatory problems may present as hypothermia or hyperthermia even in relatively mild temperatures (10 -15 .5°C or 50—6o°F).
7711,"运动员应摄人足量的水，一旦出现热或冷损伤时， 应立刻脱离冷热环境并予以治疗（Peck & Mckeag, 1994)。","The athlete should take in adequate amounts of water and, at the first sign of heat or cold injury should be removed from the environment and treatment sought promptly (Peck & McKeag, 1994)."
7712,李克特氏量表(Likert-type scale) 在第15章的调查研究技术中会提到。,The Likert-type scale is referred to in chapter 15 in connection with survey research techniques.
7712,"通常有五个或七个点,并假设点与点的间距是等距的。",It is usually a five- or seven-point scale with assumed equal intervals between points.
7712,"量表用来评估对一个陈述的同意或不同意程度 ,广泛的用于态度量表。",The Likert-type scale is used to assess the degree of agreement or disagreement with statements and is widely used in attitude inventories.
7713,李克特氏量表（Likert-type scale)在第15章的调查研究技术中会提到。,The Likert-type scale is referred to in chapter 15 in connection with survey research techniques.
7713,通常有五个或七个点，并假设点与点的间距是等距的。,It is usually a five- or seven-point scale with assumed equal intervals between points.
7713,李克特氏量表用来评估对一个陈述的同意或不同意程度，广泛的用于态度量表。,The Likert-type scale is used to assess the degree of agreement or disagreement with statements and is widely used in attitude inventories.
7714,无论采用何种类型的测试方法，测试到的等长（静力性）收缩力量或动力性收缩力量反映的都是不同个体之间同一种相对力量。,Strength measured as isometric or dynamic force reflects the same relative strength between individuals regardless of the type of test method.
7714,在肌肉力量与肌肉收缩速度之间存在着明确的关系。,There is a well-defined relationship between force and velocity.
7714,等长力量的测量速度为0。,Isometric strength is force measured at zero velocity.
7714,"成人中的这种关系首先由阿斯穆森等（Asmussen et al.，1965)提出，并在后来由霍尔托巴吉等 (Hortobagyi et al., 1989，1990)所证实，他们在对一般力量构成成分进行研究时发现了这种关系。","This was first shown in adults by Asmussen et al. (1965) and has lately been confirmed by Hortobagyi et al. (1989, 1990), where evidence for a general strength component was investigated."
7715,单独拘禁是一个严酷的计划。,Solitary Confinement is a brutal routine.
7715,尽管由于该计划中缺少休息，力量的发展多少有点儿打折，但专注其中的话，你的全身都会得到绝好的锻炼。何况在力量的问题上，并非越多越好。,"It will give awesome total-body conditioning and fitness benefits to the dedicated, although strength development will be compromised somewhat by the lack of rest built into the program—more is not better where strength is concerned."
7715,该计划中，六艺会在三天中练完，在一周内循环两次。,"It involves the Big Six performed over a three-day cycle, repeated twice over seven days."
7715,这套密集计划还给受虐狂增加了一些补充练习。,"To this dense routine, ancillary work is added for masochists."
7715,只有苦练体操一年以上、恢复能力超好的人才可尝试。,It should only be attempted by individuals with excellent recovery ability who have been in hard calisthenics training for over a year.
7715,每周至少需要空出六七个小时才能完成这套计划。,You’ll need at least six or seven hours free per week to finish this program.
7715,另外，不要一整年都这么折腾自己。,Don’t abuse it all year-round.
7716,如果要测量“真正的”最大功率输出，试验的时间必须很短（<1s)，因为作为时间的函数，功率输出会快速下降 (图36.1)。测量“真正的”最大功率需要测量力和速度的瞬间值。,"If 'true' peak power output is to be measured, the duration of the test must be short ( <1s), because power output decreases rapidly as a function of time (Fig. 36.1).The measurement of 'true' peak power requires measurements of instantaneous values of force and velocity."
7716,只有使用测力台试验或者使用几个单关节的力-速度试验才能达到这个条件。,"This condition is only satisfied in tests which use a force platform, or several monoarticular force-velocity tests."
7716,在其他功率试验中 (阶梯跑或者在阻力-负荷的自行车功率计上骑车），力和速度都是平均值，而不是瞬间值（Vandewalle et al.，1987)。,"In other power tests (staircase running or cycling on friction-loaded ergometers), the forces and the velocities are averaged instead of being instantaneous values (Vandewalle et al., 1987)."
7717,记者讲述故事时沉浸在戏剧化中。在某些事例中，新闻叙事把一个个相对独立的事件联系在一起，从而在叙事过程中造成了一 种 “令人担忧的趋势”和“新的灾难”。,"Journalists tell stories steeped in drama, and in some cases, news narratives link otherwise independent events to one another, creating ""troubling trends"" and ""new scourges"" in the process."
7717,例证理论包括了聚合事例的描述从而暗示某种趋势的出现（Zillmarm，1999) ，以及通过识别所谓的道德失败从而在新闻受众之中引起情感的反应。,"Exemplification involves aggregating case descriptions to imply the presence of a trend (Zillmann, 1999), triggering emotional reactions among news audiences by identifying supposed moral failures."
7718,自 Glass从1976年引入统合分析以来，数以千计的统合分析文章陆续被发表，特别是在社会科学、行为科学，以及医学科学领域。,"Since Glass introduced meta-analysis in 1976, thousands of meta-analyses have been published, especially in the social, behavioral, and medical sciences."
7718,在1986年由美国国家卫生研究院所赞助的随机控制临床试验概述方法学议题工作坊(Workshop on Methodological Issues in Overviews of Randomized Clinical Trials)，与会者在以统合分析进行健康相关与医学研究之应用，皆投入可观的注意力。,"At a national conference in 1986 sponsored by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, Workshop on Methodological Issues in Overviews of Randomized Clinical Trials, participants focused considerable attention on meta-analysis for health-related and medical research."
7718,由 Cooper与 Hedges在1994年编著的《研究整合手册 (The Handbook of Research Synthesis)》，仍然是规划与实施统合分析综评(meta-analyticalreview)中最有用的资讯来源之一。,"The Handbook of Research Synthesis, edited by Cooper and Hedges (1994), is still one of the most useful sources of information for planning and conducting meta-analytical reviews."
7719,有些癌症是由具传染性的病毒引起的，比如HIV(艾滋病病毒）。,"Some cancer is caused by viruses that are contagious, like HIV."
7719,所以在某种程度上来说，人人有可能传染上癌症。,"So in a way, you can catch cancer."
7719,癌症不会通过血液、唾液或是细菌传染，但是却会通过间接的方式传染。人们会通过一些身体有机物的传播患上癌症，对于宫颈癌、肝癌和淋巴癌来说尤其如此。,"You can't swap cancer through bloodstream, saliva, or germs, but in a roundabout way, you can pass along some of the organisms that could cause cancer This is especially true for cervical and liver cancers, as well as some lymphomas."
7720,从你第一次感到喉咙痛开始，你就十分清楚地意识到你的免疫系统了。那时爸爸妈妈会在你的下巴下面摸你的淋巴，因为他们在寻找肿胀的淋巴结。,"From your first sore throat, you were well aware of your lymph system -when your mom or doctor would feel under your jaw.Thats because they were looking for swollen lymph nodes."
7720,淋巴系统是免疫系统活动的地方。,Your lymph system is where all the immune activity takes place.
7721,体内血糖含量应低于100mg/dL。糖尿病患者的血液中含糖量过高，会降低一种特殊的磷激酶的活性，从而对动脉造成伤害。磷激酶能够让动脉自如地扩张收缩。,"Keep it lower than 100 mg/dL The excess sugar in the blood that's caused by diabetes damages the arteries by inactivating a specific phosphokinase, a substance that makes it possible for your arteries to dilate smoothly and contract."
7721,没有这种酶，不同部位动脉血管壁连接处出现裂缝坑洞的可能性就会大大增加。,"Without that phosphokinasc, the risk of holes or cracks appearing at junctions in the arterial walls increases dramatically."
7722,专家认为，蛋白质的每日摄入量如果超过140克（相当于一天吃450克鸡肉、鱼肉、牛肉或猪肉，或是吃1100克的坚果），则会给骨骼发育带来不良影响。过量的蛋白质会导致人体排出而不是吸收钙质。,"Large amounts of protein eaten every day—in the amount of more than 140 grams a day (that's the equivalent of a pound of chicken, fish, beef, or pork, or two and a half pounds of nuts in a day)— are believed to be threatening to your bones because the extra protein can cause your body to excrete calcium rather than absorb it."
7722,饮用含咖啡因的饮料或碳酸饮料时，也会引起同样的问题。咖啡因会在钙质发挥作用之前促其排出体外。,Same goes for carbonated and caffeinated drinks; the caffeine may actually make you excrete the calcium before your body's been given a chance to use it.
7722,而磷酸盐对骨骼中钙质的存储可能更为不利。,The phosphates may be even worse for your bones' calcium stores.
7723,“你真为跑步做好准备了吗？拉伸并不重要，”凯利•斯塔雷特写道，他是国内知名的研究灵活性和运动表现的学者之一，“姿势和姿势的使用才是重中之重。,"“Are you truly ready for this? Stretching is not important,” writes Kelly Starrett, DPT, one of the country’s foremost thinkers on the subject of mobility and athletic performance."
7723,如果你因为动作受限或因为某些肌肉组织的约束而不能保证良好的姿势，单纯拉伸并不能给你想要的结果。”,"“Position and the application of position are what matters most. If you can’t get into a good position because you’re limited or you have a tissue restriction of some kind, stretching alone won’t give you the results you want.”"
7724,"刘易斯列线图试验：由于纵跳试验有作功的尺度（力x位移）问题，刘易斯列线图（Lewis nomogram)是用来与纵跳试验同时使用的 (Fox & Mathews, 1981),其目的是将“速度”加到体重和所完成的纵跳距离上。","Lewis nomogram test: Because the vertical jump test has the dimension of work (force x displacement), the Lewis nomogram has been designed to be used concomitantly with the former test (Fox & Mathews, 1981).The aim is to add 'speed' to the body mass and the vertical distance performed."
7724,该试验尚无客观性和可靠性的数据，也没有试验的正常值。,There are no measures of objectivity or reliability and no norms are available for the test.
7724,最近，哈曼等开展了对成年男子的有效性研究，结论是刘易斯的公式无法精确评估腿部肌肉的功率。,"Recently, Harman et al. conducted a validation study on male adults and concluded that the Lew is formula does not provide accurate estimate of muscle leg pow er."
7725,"我们试图对比贝克汉姆在英国和美国的形象,是为了论证他的商业语料库的流动性。",Our intent in contrasting Beckham's image in the US and the UK has been to demonstrate the fluidity of his commercial corpus.
7725,"为了达到这个目的,我们指向了流动名流的建构以及在这些企业化的和有形的建构之中固有的缺陷。",In so doing we have pointed to the construction of liquid celebrity and the pitfalls inherent in such corporatized or corporeal constitutions.
7725,"在全球范围内,由西蒙•福勒所组织和经营的、贝克汉姆作为晚期资本主义商品化身的时刻,一直是相当精确而完整的。","Beckham's embodiment of the late capitalist moment on a global scale, organized and managed by Simon Fuller, has been quite exact and complete."
7726,这一系列的观察性研究发轫于于1940年代后期与1960年代初期之间。,A series of observational studies was initiated between the late 1940s and early 1960s.
7726,在这些研究中，有部分研究对身体活动流行病学（physical activity epidemiology）领域的发展尤为重要。因为这是首次透过研究发展身体活动测量方法，以及采用系统性的方式以分析身体活动及致命疾病间的关联。,A number of them were particularly important to the development of the field of physical activity epidemiology because they were the first to develop methods for measuring physical activity and to conduct systematic studies of the link between physical activity and a life-threatening disease.
7727,在做绿巨人式时，抓住位于胸前的两根栏杆，前臂大约与地面平行，双手相距约15厘米——相当于两根栏杆的间距。,"In the hulk pull, grab hold of two bars in front of your chest.Your forearms should be more or less parallel with the floor and your knuckles should be about six inches apart—the equivalent of one bar space."
7727,手臂弯曲，使躯干与栏杆保持仅几厘米的距离：这是最有利的拉栏杆姿势。,Your arms will be well bent so that your torso is only a few inches from the bars.This is the strongest bar pull position.
7727,然后尽全力拉，就像要把栏杆拉开一样。,"Now pull as hard as you can, as if trying to pry the bars apart."
7728,罗马椅仰卧起坐由下斜仰卧起坐演变而来，不过强度更大。,Roman Chair Sit-Up is a more intense modification of incline sit-ups.
7728,双腿钩住固定架，双腿也在椅子上得到支撑，这样你的躯干和髋部就在无支撑的情况下向后悬空。,"Hook your legs under something that will also support your thighs, so you can hang backwards with nothing supporting your torso or hips."
7728,从这个姿势开始做仰卧起坐，这样中段就必须更加用力才能在动作的最低点控制身体。你也可以再向下倾斜一点儿，超过一般仰卧起坐的限制，这样就增加了动作幅度。,"Doing sit-ups from this position means that your midsection has to exert much greater force to control the trunk in the bottom position; you can also go back further than in regular or incline sit-ups, so the range of motion is increased."
7729,"对数线性模式(loglinear models) 通常用在分析多因子列联表上,将相对次数转换成对数的形式后相加,与单因子变异数分析中的平方和类似。","Loglinear models are used to analyze multivariate contingency tables.Relative frequencies are transformed to logarithms, which are additive and similar to the sum of squares in ANOVA."
7729,并透过检定的方式来检定主要效果和交互作用的效果。,Main effects and interactions can be tested for significance.
7729,并以对数比的基础所建构的罗吉斯回归方程式来预测每笔资料的机率(又称逻辑回归）。,The probability of membership in a particular category can be predicted as a function of membership in other categories using a logistic regression equation based on the logarithmic odds of membership (called a logit).
7730,"逻辑效度有时被称为表面效度(face validity),但测验专家并不喜欢这个术语。","Logical validity is sometimes referred to as face validity, although measurement experts dislike that term."
7730,"当测量本身很明显地包含了想测量内容时,就被认为具备逻辑效度。",Logical validity is claimed when the measure obviously involves the performance being measured.
7730,"换句话说,逻辑效度表示, 从定义上来说这个测验就是正确的。","In other words, it means that the test is valid by definition."
7731,骆驼式——双膝跪地，两膝相距几厘米。,Camel Hold——Kneel on the floor with your knees a few inches apart.
7731,屁股不要坐在小腿上，大腿与躯干成一条直线，与小腿的夹角成90°。,"Rather than sitting down on your calves, raise yourself up so that your hips are straight and your body forms an “L” shape."
7731,由此姿势开始，脊柱慢慢向后弯曲成弓形，双手向后抓住脚踝。,"From this position, slowly arch your spine back and reach behind you to grasp your ankles."
7731,之后将髋部向前推，使脊柱的弯曲度最大化，坚持10-30秒。,"Once you have hold of them, push your hips forwards, maximizing the bend in your spine."
7731,说来容易，但这需要脊柱的深层肌肉有一定力量才能完成。,"Although this sounds easy, it requires some strength in the deeper spinal muscles to complete the position."
7731,我是从一位住在美国西海岸的瑜伽修行者那里学到这个绝妙动作的。,Hold for ten to thirty seconds.I learned this nifty stretch from a yoga guy living on the West Coast.
7731,好像没人知道它为什么叫“骆驼式”，我一点儿也看不出哪里像骆驼。,Nobody seems to know why it’s called  “camel hold”——looks nothing like a camel to me.
7732,用脚后跟先着地是不可取的，因为这个习惯会导致脚踝、脚后跟、臀部等部位受伤。,"Landing on the heel is bad because the impact can cause a host of injuries to the ankles, knees, and hips."
7732,即使是高科技跑鞋带来的支撑效果也不能永久地避免这类损伤。,Even the cushioning afforded by big running shoes can’t stave off injury forever.
7732,逐渐地，这种落地方式还会导致软组织撕裂，进而继续磨损受伤部位，直到可能需要外科手术才能修复磨损的软骨或受损的肌腱。,"Bit by bit, these cushioned impacts still tear away soft tissue, grinding their way toward injury and possible surgery to repair worn-down cartilage or shredded tendons."
7732,纠正跑步的落地方式不仅是为了减轻不良后果，更是为了提高跑步的效率。,But correcting one’s foot strike is not just about reducing impact; it’s also about improving running efficiency.
7732,如果你的跑步技术过硬，那么落地方式根本不是问题。就好比现在有一个球，你跳起来以后脚部可以不假思索地落在球所在的位置。,"Foot strike is a nonissue when mechanics are sound, as the foot lands exactly where it is supposed to—on the ball—without thought."
7733,马耳他俯卧撑与俯卧撑的渊源关系已经不太明显，它经常被体操运动员用来模拟吊环训练。,"These are an obscure variation of the pushup often used by gymnasts, because they partially mimic training on the rings."
7733,马耳他俯卧撑有点儿像标准俯卧撑，只不过双手要和髋部成一条直线，而且要远离身体。,"Maltese pushups look a little like full pushups, but the hands are placed in line with the hips, and quite far out from the body."
7733,如果你在某个做该动作的人身体正中画一条直线，然后以其双手为端点画一条直线，这两条线将构成马耳他十字，这个动作因此得名。,"If you were to draw a line up the athlete’s torso and another from palm to palm in this position, the two lines would approximate a Maltese cross, hence the name of the exercise."
7733,这个变式的具体做法很难理解，除非你亲眼看到有人做该动作。,The movement required by this type of pushup is difficult to appreciate unless you actually see an expert doing it.
7733,马耳他俯卧撑能够锻炼肱二头肌和肱三头肌，但它对训练者肘部内侧的要求极其苛刻。,"Maltese pushups work the biceps as well as the triceps, but the technique can be rough on the inner elbows."
7733,除非你是体操运动员，否则我不建议你做这个。,"Unless you are a gymnast, I’d disregard them."
7734,对于一些人来说，我也许像个偏执狂，但是总有人能理解我探寻跑步艺术的热情和不断进取的精神，布菜恩• 麦肯齐就是其中之一。,"To some people I might seem obsessive, but there are others who share my passion for understanding the act of running and for constantlyseeking to improve.Brian MacKenzie is one of these."
7734,对于全球新一代参与混合健身和混合健身耐力训练的跑者，麦肯齐可谓是天赐之人。,"For a new generation of runners around the world who have taken up CrossFit and CrossFit Endurance, Brian has been a godsend."
7734,麦肯齐对于跑步训练知识的渴求是从他自己的“逐龙”之旅开始的，这条龙正是长距离耐力比赛。,"His hunger for knowledge has been insatiable since he himself started “chasing the dragon,” as he likes to call the beast that is long-course endurance racing."
7734,不论是参加超级马拉松比赛还是铁人三项比赛，麦肯齐一直热衷于不断更新训练计划，包括调整饮食计划、选择极简跑鞋和采用力量调节训练提高运动水平并避免受伤。,"Whether he’s competing in ultramarathons or Ironman® triathlons, Brian has feverishly tinkered with the many variables that go into the craft, from diet to minimalist footwear to the use of strength conditioning as a way both to improve performance and to ward off injury."
7735,马里恩俯卧撑是我在马里恩监狱中学来的，是下斜俯卧撑的高强度升级版。,"Marion pushups are an intense, progressive form of decline pushup I learned in Marion Pen."
7735,下斜俯卧撑需要把双脚抬起来，放在某些东西上。,Decline pushups are just pushups with your feet elevated—lifted up on something.
7735,如果你的脚可以抬得足够高，那么该动作就不怎么锻炼胸部了，而是会转而锻炼肩膀前部的肌肉。,"If you lift your feet high enough, the pushups stop working the chest as much and start working the muscles at the front of the shoulders."
7736,双手大约与肩同宽，上半身挺直，膝关节微微弯曲。,"Your hands should be about shoulder width apart, and despite the angle at the hips, your torso should be straight."
7736,弯曲手臂，肩部下沉，放低身体，直到下巴轻触双手之间的地面。,"Retain a gentle bend at the knee.Bending at the arms and shoulders, lower your chin until it kisses the floor at a point between your hands."
7736,然后，髋部慢慢下降划过地面，下巴继续向前划出一条弧线，直到双臂和双腿伸直，此时肩部高于髋部。,"Now continue moving your chin in an upwards arc, as your hips drop to brush the ground.You should finish the movement with your arms and legs straight, your shoulders high and your hips low."
7736,双臂保持伸直的状态，臀部向后撅起回到起始姿势，重复练习。,"Keeping your arms straight, push your butt out and back until you are in the starting position again,and repeat."
7736,尽管这个变式中的弯曲和伸展动作可以练出强大、柔韧的髋部，但对上身肌肉来说，该练习比标准俯卧撑更容易。,"This exercise is easier on the upper body muscles than regular pushups, although the jackknife bending and straightening motion builds strong, flexible hips."
7736,因此，它在武术家和摔跤运动员中十分流行。,"For this reason, the exercise is popular with martial artists and wrestlers."
7736,该练习有时也被称为猫式俯卧撑。,Sometimes this exercise is known as a cat pushup.
7737,大多数人更换空气过滤器或空气加湿器的频率很不够，所以机器就并未有效工作。,"Most people don't change air filters or clean humidifiers with enough regularity, so they're not that effective."
7737,如果不能定期清理空气加湿器，机器里的水会成为藏污纳垢的场所，滋生霉菌和真菌，最后你还会呼吸到这些东西。,"Unless humidifiers are cleaned regularly, they’ll form a cesspool of water, which grows mold and fungi, and then you end up breathing it."
7737,相反地，如果你坚持定期维护，这些机器就能有效地滤去空气中的过敏物，非常有用。,"If you stick to regular maintenance, however, they can be useful for taking allergens out of the air."
7738,由于多数成人对于牛奶、橙汁或麦片的摄入量不足，在饮食中补充维生素D就可以让我们吸收足量。,"Since most adults don’t drink enough milk or orange juice or eat enough cereal to get the recommended dosages,supplementing your diet with D can give you the levels you need."
7738,如果是60岁以下的人，我们建议摄入400国际单位的维生累D作为补充；如果超过60岁，摄入600国际单位为宜。,"We recommend that you take 1,000 IU of vitamin D in a supplement if you're under sixty and 1,200 IU if you're over sixty."
7738,这样的摄入量对钙质的最佳吸收是必要的，也有利于钙质很好地与骨骼结合。,That's how much is necessary for the optimal absorption of calcium and the optimal incorporation into the bone.
7738,我们还建议补充400至500毫克的镁（一种在杏仁中发现的营养物质），因为镁能帮助平衡钙质对神经功能的影响。,"We also recommend 400 to 500 milligrams of magnesium (a nutrient found in almonds), because magnesium helps balance the effects of calcium on nerve function."
7739,顺便提一句，酒精是一把双刃釗。,Alcohol is a double-edged sword.
7739,从好的方面看，酒精能缓解炎症，这其中的原因人们还不十分清楚。,"It decreases inflammation, for reasons not fully understood."
7739,但是，过量的酒精会造成免疫系统老化，也许这是由于酒精降低了免疫细胞的活性。,"But too much of it can cause aging of the immune system, perhaps by inactivating the cells that defend you."
7739,男性每天喝两杯半以上的酒，女性每天喝一杯半以上，都会构成对健康的直接威胁。,Anything over about two and a half drinks daily for men and one and a half drinks for women is a net increase in risk.
7740,最简单的障碍是无孔处女膜 (imperforate hymen)，阻止子宫黏液和内膜血液的流出。,"The simplest single disorder is that of the imperforate hymen, which does not permit the outward passage of uterine mucous and endometrial blood."
7740,这些液体积聚造成阴道积水（hydrocolpos)或阴道子宫积水 (hydrometrocolpos)并使处女膜膨出和 (或）引起每月发作的腹部疼痛。,These accumulate in the vagina (hydrocolpos) or uterus (hydrometrocolpos) and produce a bulging hymen; and/or one may elicit a vague history of abdominal pain that m ay have monthly exacerbations.
7740,苗勒氏管发育不全（Müllerian agenesis 或hypoplasia)会导致阴道和子宫上部的疾病，形成非常短的阴道并造成闭经；但是，必须与无孔处女膜、阴道的其他疾病和男性激素不敏感综合征加以鉴别。,"Müllerian agenesis or hypoplasia leads to disorders of the upper portion of the vagina and uterus.These disorders produce a very short vagina ending in a blind pouch and primary amenorrhoea; however, the differential diagnoses include imperforate hymen, other disorders of the vagina and the androgen insensitivity syndromes."
7741,强烈的负面情感状态对心脏有害，它带来的负面影响会让你的生理年龄增大8岁，因此不只是“情感丰富、敢感易怒”那么简单。,"Powerful negative emotional states are bad for your heart and are important enough to make your RealAge effect eight years older, so this is not just touchy-feely stuff."
7741,这样的情绪会引起高压，还会千扰人体修复机制的正常运作， 限制血管活动，造成血流不足。,"These emotions can cause high blood pressure, as well as disrupt your body's normal repair mechanism and also constrict your blood vessels, making it even harder for enough blood to work its way through."
7741,有几种不同的治疗方法会有助于你用比较健康的方式处理这些有害的感情，例如学习放松疗法、冥想、交些不会惹你生气的朋友，等等。,"Various kinds of therapies—including learning relaxation techniques and meditation, and having friends you'd never think of getting angry with—can help you handle these damaging feelings in a healthier way (see below)."
7742,这种研究主要在了解不同母群体中健康与疾病情况的次数与分布。,This type of research pertains to the frequencies and distributions of health and disease conditions among populations.
7742,流行病学研究的基本观念是发生率。,Rate of occurrence is the basic concept in epidemiological studies.
7742,母群体的大小是检测损伤、罹病的盛行率或是处于特定危险族群的健康状况时，一个相当重要的考量因素。,"The size of the population being studied is an important consideration in examining the prevalence of such things as injuries, illnesses, or health conditions in a specified at-risk population."
7743,预测的其中一项限制跟概化效果(generalizability)有 关。,One limitation of prediction relates to generalizability.
7743,一个以特定样本发展出来的迴归方程式被应用到其它样本时会失去相当淮确性，此在预测里称作缩小(shrinkage)。,Regression equations developed with a particular sample often lose considerable accuracy when applied to others.This loss of accuracy in prediction is called shrinkage.
7743,母群体特异性(population specificity) 也跟此现象有关。,The term population specificity also relates to this phenomenon.
7744,在急性损伤和手术后即刻，儿童和青少年可能需要使用药物来控制疼痛，用什么药以及用多大剂量取决于损伤的严重程度。,"Immediately following an acute injury or an operative procedure, children and adolescents may require pain medication.The type and dosage of the medication depend on the severity of the injury."
7744,儿童在单纯骨折时仅需服用一天左右的扑热息痛。,Young children with simple fractures rarely require medication other than a day or so of acetaminophen.
7744,年龄稍大的儿童若发生伴有明显肿胀的严重损伤，可以服用非甾体类抗炎药，如布洛芬，奈普生，托美汀硫酸盐等。,"Older children and teenagers with more severe injuries accompanied by marked swelling often benefit from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, naproxyn or tolmetin sulphate."
7745,因此，这些教练揭示了当代体育越来越普遍的一个悖论：当他们成功时会被体育媒体创造为崇拜的对象；当他们深陷丑闻时又会被标记为谴责的对象。,"Thus, these coaches reveal a paradox that is increasingly common in contemporary sports: created by the sports media as objects of admiration when they succeed, these individuals are subsequently marked as objects of condemnation when they succumb to scandal."
7745,我们应该明智地考虑体育媒体报道所揭示的文化趋势，而不是将这些叙事仅仅当作变幻无常的大众传媒市场的产品。,"Rather than see such narratives merely as products of a ficide mass media marketplace, we would be wise to consider the cultural tendencies revealed by sports media coverage."
7745,用文内尔（W h a _ l ，2 0 0 2 ) 的话来说，“当体育传媒报道的强度越来越大，当体育明星系统成为媒体体育产业核心的时候，体育明星的形象就变成关于道德和男子气概的社会焦虑的聚合点”( P .1 ) 。,"In Whannel's (2002) words, ""as the intensity of media coverage of sport has increased, and as the sporting star system has become central to the media sports industry, the images of sport stars become the point of convergence of social anxieties over morality andmasculinity"" (p. 1)."
7745,尽管文内尔的关注点在名流运动员，但是当名流教练们看上去越过了精力充沛的男性气概领导权的正常界限时，同样的焦虑也会发生。,"Although Whannel's focus is on celebrity athletes, similar anxieties are in play when the behavior of celebrity coaches appears to exceed the normal boundaries of vigorous masculine leadership."
7746,在月经来潮前，囊肿会变大变软，绝经后就停止生长。,"Cysts, which stop with menopause, are larger and more tender just before periods."
7746,激素含量失衡是一种可能的原因。为了防治囊肿，应避免食用含甲基黄嘌呤的食品，比如咖啡、红茶和可乐。,"A hormonal imbalance is the likely cause; to help prevent cysts, avoid methylxanthines, which are found in coffee, black tea, and colas."
7747,运动表现的内在昼夜节律-Youngstedt (扬斯戴特）和奥康纳（O’Connor)认为，一天中运动表现的变化（前面已经概括了的）可能是由于环境和行为的因素所致，正如是内在生物钟的命令一样。,Intrinsic Circadian rhythms of performance-Youngstedt and O’Connor argued that the changes in performance during the course of the day (outlined in the preceding section) were just as likely due to environmental and behavioral factors as to the dictates of an intrinsic biological clock.8
7747,举例来说，吃饭的时间可以改变葡萄糖的存储情况（实际上，用餐时间的改变可以使短距离疾跑的最佳能力转移到下午的晚些时候，这一点已经被确认）。,"Timing of meals, for instance, could alter glycogen stores.(It has been shown, in fact, that altera-tions in meal times can shift time of peak sprinting ability to later in the afternoon.)"
7747,一些人声称咖啡的摄入，或反之，咖啡因的排出也能影响表现的周期性。,"Some have claimed that coffee intake or, conversely, caffeine  withdrawal can also affect periodicity of performance."
7748,汉娜（Hannah)却与其队友相反，表现出渴望参加运动，刻苦训练，努力发挥自己的潜能，并为自己的成就感到高兴和自豪。,"Hannah portrays a stark contrast to her teammate: she readily looks forward to participation, puts forth a high level of intensity during play, performs up to her potential and exhibits pride and pleasure in her accomplishments."
7748,为什么她们两个人的想法、感觉和行为差别这么大？,"Why do these two individuals think, feel and behave so differently?"
7748,一个可能的解释 就是在运动领域中她们的自我知觉 (self-perception)存在差异。,One possible answer is their self-perceptions in the domain of sport.
7748,克里斯蒂娜的身体能力感较低，而汉娜拥有较高水平的能力感（competence perceptions)。,"Christine perceives a low sense of physical capabilities, while Hannah possesses a high level of competence perceptions."
7748,反过来，不同的自我知觉（self-perceptions)又导致参与体育运动的不同动机、运动表现以及不同的情绪体验。,"These differing self-perceptions, in turn, result in variations in motivation, performance and emotional reactions to sport participation."
7749,对于正在生长中的儿童来说，无氧代谢产生的能量非常重要，因为儿童参加的许多活动是属于爆发性的能量消耗活动（如短跑冲刺）而不是中等强度长时间的活动。,Anaerobic energy production is important for the growing child because many of the activities of children involve bursts of energy expenditure (or sprints) rather than activities of moderate intensity for extended periods of time.
7749,因此，仅仅通过骨骼肌的有氧代谢是不能满足活动中的儿童的能量需求的。,The energy needs of the exercising child thus cannot always be met by the oxidative properties of the working skeletal muscles.
7749,无氧代谢功能机制就对这类活动起着重大的作用。,Anaerobic energy production mechanisms must come into play to permit such activities.
7750,色甘酸的预防效果持续约2小时，但与特布他林合用时，预防效果加倍。,"Cromolyn’s protective effect lasts about 2 h, but in combination with terbutaline, protection lasts twice as long."
7750,色甘酸钠有3种剂型：胶囊粉剂(每一个胶囊含20 mg)经粉雾吸入器吸入；定量吸入剂每次喷射1 mg;喷雾器溶液每瓶含20 mg。,"Cromolyn sodium is available in three forms: a powder contained within a capsule (20 mg • capsule-1), inhaled via a Spinhaler, a metered-dose inhaler (1 mg • puff-1) and a nebulizer solution (20mg • amp-1)."
7750,尼多酸钠是含有色甘酸钠的合剂，有相似的作用和效力，也没有毒性。,"Nedocromil sodium is a com pound related to cromolyn sodium, with com parable potency and efficacy, and comparable freedom from toxicity."
7751,钙通道阻滞剂此类新药用于不同医学领域。,Calcium channel blockers.These new agents are finding use in m any different medical settings.
7751,正如莱曼斯克等人（1989）和米德尔顿所指出的，哮喘患者呼吸道的病理过程是具有钙依赖性的：“在平滑肌中兴奋—收缩的耦合，在肥大细胞和黏液腺中刺激—分泌的耦合……和炎性细胞的移动和激活（都有钙的参与）。,"As Lemanske and Middleton point out, the pathological processes in the airways of patients with asthma are calcium-dependent: ‘excitation—contraction coupling in smooth muscle, stimulus—secretion coupling in mast cells and mucous glands . . . and the movement and activation of inflammatory cells’."
7751,"” 钙通道阻滞剂尼非地平和维拉帕米（verapamil，异搏定）对阻断运动性哮喘都有效，而地尔硫卓（diltiazem, 恬尔心）却无效。","The calcium channel blockers nifedipine and verapamil have been shown to be effective in blocking EIA , while diltiazem has not."
7752,手臂向两侧伸展，然后开始画圈。,Simply hold your arms out to the side and begin to make circles.
7752,该动作是动态的，而且所需的柔韧性也比一般人所想的更大，所以你不要一开始就疯狂摇摆，否则可能扭伤那些还没有热起来的肌肉。,"This exercise is dynamic and requires more flexibility than most people realize, so don’t just start wildly swinging or you might tweak cold muscles."
7752,先以小圈开始，大约飞盘那么大的圆就行。双肩逐渐打开之后，再扩大旋转幅度，直到达到你的最大幅度。,Start with small circles—no larger than a Frisbee—and as your shoulders begin to loosen gradually expand your rotations to the maximum of your range of motion.
7752,做上50次（即画50个完整的圈），再僵硬的上身也会热起来，但不要忘记要以相反方向重复相同的次数。,"One set of fifty reps (i.e., fifty full circles) will warm up even the tightest upper body, but don’t forget to repeat the exercise for the same number of reps, circling in the opposite direction."
7752,稍微难一点的是“逆转风车”，双臂要以相反方向旋转。,"A slightly harder variation is alternate windmills, which involves the arms circling in different directions before switching."
7753,当然，要完成呼吸过程，肺的其他组成部分也是必不可少的。,"Of course, your lungs also have other parts that are integral to the breathing process."
7753,支气管负责清理肺部坏境。,Your bronchial tubes are responsible for cleaning out your lungs.
7753,肺就像小块的四岁生日蛋糕，表面包裹着黏液，黏附着灰尘和微生物。,"Typically, they’re like a four-year-old’s birthday cake covered with mucus, which dirt and germs stick to."
7753,肺部还有上万根被称为纤毛的细小绒毛。,Your lungs also have millions of tiny hairs called cilia.
7753,纤毛的作用像小扫帚，将所有黏在黏液上的杂物统统扫走。,Cilia act like little brooms that sweep away all the stuff that’s caught in your mucus.
7754,心脏就像你家一样，也有“门厅”——心房，储存流入心脏的血液。,"Now just like your house, your heart also has an atrium, which holds the blood coming into the heart."
7754,当这种相对不太重要的房间发生纤维性颤动时，人们会感到心悸。,"When fibrillation happens in this less critical chamber, folks feel palpitations."
7754,与需要植入AICD的心脏病人不同，这种患者有时需要用其他方法治疗，比如植入起搏器、射频消溶手术或服用药品，药物治疗包括服用降低血液黏度的药品，能够防止不断运动的心房壁上因凝血累积而引发中风。,"Instead of an AICD, these people sometimes need minimally invasive procedures like a pacemaker insertion, ablation, or medications including a blood thinner to prevent blood clots that accumulate on the quivering atrial walls and can cause strokes."
7755,农夫行走。,Farmer's Walk.
7755,这是一项很棒的躯干力量练习。,This is an excellent trunk-strengthening exercise.
7755,双手各拿一个哑铃或者壶铃，然后在指定距离内来回走动，通常距离是10-20米。,"Start by lifting a dumbbell or kettlebell in each hand, and then begin walking a predetermined distance, typically 10 to 20 yards."
7756,"在当今流行文化下，像WNBA中那些女性一样的职业女性运动员依旧被市场化为后女性主义的英雄，她们大概成了女孩儿和年轻女性的正面形象模板，因为在她们举例证明了女孩儿的力量，一种显然无威胁的、非政治性的女权主义形式（Taft, 2004)。","In contemporary popular culture, professional female athletes like the women of the WNBA continue to be marketed as postfeminist heroes who presumably provide girls and young women with positive role models, given that they exemplify girl power, an explicitly nonthreatening and nonpolitical form of feminism (Taft, 2004)."
7756,让我们将目光从依然存在的意识形态和不公正的历史力量移开，后女性主义“女孩儿的力量”假定两性之间的平等已经实现。,"Rather than focus on ideologies and historical forces of inequality that still persist, postfeminist ""girl power"" posits that equality between the sexes has been achieved."
7756,这意味着，女孩儿和妇女可以庆祝和拥抱女性气质，而不是彻底地拒绝它们，她们开始享受第二次女性主义浪潮所带来的好处，尤其是她们可以打入由男性主导的领域的出口，例如体育。,"This means that girls and women can celebrate and embrace femininity rather than rejecting it outright while still enjoying the benefits of second wave feminism, especially the achievement of access to male-dominated institutions such as sports."
7757,狂食行为通常包括摄入高热量的食物（糖果），常常不引人注意或秘密地进食。,"The eating binge typically includes high caloric density foods (sweets), usually eaten incon­spicuously or secretly."
7757,通过呕吐来缓解腹部不适，但患者能继续狂食行为。,"By using vomiting to relieve abdominal discomfort, the individual can continue the binge."
7757,与神经性厌食症一样，神经性易饿症也是开始于青春期或成年早期。,"As with anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa begins in adolescence or in early adulthood."
7757,易饿症患者的家长常常是肥胖的，而易饿症患者在青春期通常也是肥胖的。,"Parents of bulimics are frequently obese, and bulimics have often been obese during adolescence."
7758,你的眼睛需要有较好的润滑从而准确聚焦。眼球通过泪腺及副泪腺和眨眼保持润滑。,Your eyes need to be well lubricated to focus; they stay lubricated through your three-layer tear supply and by blinking.
7758,通过眨眼（这是一个上眼睑活动而下眼睑不动的过程），泪水薄膜会平均地分配到眼球的表面，尤其是甬膜。,"With blinking (it's a process in which the upper lid moves but the lower one doesn't), your tear film is evenly distributed over the surface of the eye, particularly the ornea."
7758,抛媚眼却是另一回事，它有增加你遭遇性骚扰几率的副作用。）,(Winking does the same thing but has a side effect of increasing your risk of sexual harrassment suits.)
7759,如果是完美的关联，成绩应该会从图中的左下角开始，往斜对角方向出现一条笔直的线，直到右上端。,"If it were, the scores would begin in the lower left-hand comer of the figure and proceed diagonally in a straight line toward the upper right-hand corner."
7759,测量两个变项之间关联程度的一种方法是皮尔森积差相关系数（也称为组间相关，或是简单相关）。,"One measure of the degree of association between two variables is called the Pearson product moment coefficient of correlation (also known as Pearson r, interclass correlation, or simple correlation)."
7759,当两个变项之间没有关联存在时，它们的相关趋近于零。,"When two variables are unrelated, their correlation is approximately zero."
7760,皮质酮是一种类固醇物质，用于治疗各种炎症如皮疹、关节炎、哮喘、背下部疼痛等。,"Cortisone—a steroid used to treat all kinds of inflammatory conditions like skin rashes, arthritis, asthma, and lower-back pain—works by decreasing the inflammatory response and inflammation."
7760,它可以降低感染反应和感染。但是服用过多的皮质酮也会有负面效果，它会增加你患高血压、感染以及骨质疏松的风险。,"But taking too much cortisone can also have a negative effect, by increasing your risk of elevated blood pressure, increasing your risk of infections, and thinning your bones."
7761,在墙边放一个篮球，用自己觉得最容易的方式在篮球旁边蹬起成靠墙倒立，然后将一只手伸出去放在篮球上。,"Place a basketball by the base of a wall.Kick up into a wall handstand next to the basketball using whichever technique you find easiest, then reach out and place one of your palms on the basketball."
7761,这个动作说来简单，实际做起来却非常难，这需要你在很短时间（你的手找篮球所用的时间）内用一只锁定的手臂支撑整个体重。,"This motion sounds simple but is in fact very difficult; it will require supporting your bodyweight on one locked arm for a fraction of a second, or as long as it takes to find the ball."
7761,手在篮球上放稳之后再调整球的位置，使双手间距大约与肩同宽。,"Once your palm is secured on the basketball, position it so that your hands are about shoulder width apart."
7761,支撑在地上的那只手臂要伸直，另一只手臂则是弯曲的。,"The arm of the hand which is on the floor should be straight, but your other arm will be bent."
7761,让双手尽量均匀地承担体重，平缓呼吸。,"Apply your weight as evenly as you can through both hands, breathing smoothly."
7761,在这时，肱三头肌、肱二头肌及肩部都需要非常用劲，否则很可能因为控制不住篮球而摔倒。,"Your triceps, biceps and shoulders need to work very hard at this point, or you may lose control of the ball and crash down."
7761,这是偏重倒立撑的起始姿势（图119）。,This is the start position of the uneven handstand pushup (fig. 119).
7762,做经典俯卧撑姿势时，双脚并拢，双腿、髋部、上身成一条直线。双臂伸直，双手撑地，并处于上胸部的正下方。,"Get into the classic pushup position; feet together, legs, hips and back aligned, and arms straight with the palms on the floor beneath your upper chest."
7762,一只手稳固地支撑身体，另一只手撑在篮球上，双手都应置于肩膀以下保持平衡，这是偏重俯卧撑的起始姿势（图13）。,"With one arm firmly supporting you, place the other hand on a basketball.Both your hands should be directly below your shoulders for stability.This is the start position of the uneven pushup (fig. 13)."
7763,在偏重深蹲中，直立，一只脚踩在地上，另一只脚的脚跟放在位于自己前方、距身体约一步远的篮球上。,"In the uneven squats, stand up straight with one foot flat on the floor, and another resting firmly on a basketball located approximately one foot length in front of the other foot."
7763,双脚分开，与肩同宽或略宽，双臂在胸前伸直。,"The feet should be shoulder width apart or a little wider.Your arms should be out in front of you, directly opposite your chest."
7763,弯曲膝盖和髋部，直到踩在地上的那条腿的大腿后侧紧贴小腿后侧。,"Bend at the knees and hips until the back of the thigh of your non-ball leg touches the corresponding calf.You will not be able to descend any further, despite the fact that your ball leg is not compressed as much."
7763,刚开始练习时，到达最低点后可能出现身体后倾的情况，所以要确保身后有足够的干净空间，这一点对所有全幅深蹲都适用。,"While learning this position, you may tip backwards, so ensure that you have enough clear space behind you just in case.This applies to all deep squatting."
7763,暂停一下，然后双腿发力把自己推回到起始姿势。,"Pause briefly, before pushing yourself back up to the start position with both legs."
7763,在动作过程中，脚跟始终不要抬离地面，身体不要向前摇晃，尽管你可能不自觉地想这样做。,"At no point during the exercise should you raise your heel, rock forwards or bounce, despite the fact that you may instinctively want to do these things at first."
7764,在做偏重引体向上时，单手抓住横杆，采用侧握或反握姿势会比经典的正握姿势舒服。,"In the process of uneven pullups, grasp the horizontal bar with one hand.A side-on or underhand grip will be more comfortable than the classic overhand version."
7764,用另一只手抓住握横杆那只手的手腕——大拇指位于那只手的手掌下方，其他手指则位于其手背下方。,"Now take hold of the wrist of the hand which is gripping the bar, using your free hand.The thumb of the hand holding your wrist should be just below your opposite palm, with the fingers below the back of your hand."
7764,双脚离地，双膝弯曲，脚踝交叠在一起并置于身后。,"Your feet should be off the ground, knees bent, with your ankles looped behind you."
7764,始终收紧上肢带肌，抓横杆那只手臂伸直，但肘部要略微弯曲。,Your shoulder girdle should be flexed at all times.The arm that is holding the bar should be straight except for a slight kink in the elbow.
7764,另一只手臂由于位置较低，弯曲程度会比较大。,"Your other arm, due to its lower position, will be bent more acutely."
7764,你的双肘会朝向前方。,Your elbows will be in front of your torso.
7764,弯曲肘部，夹起肩部，平缓地将自己拉起来，直到下巴高过横杆。,Bend at the elbows and shoulders to smoothly pull yourself up until your chin is over the bar.
7764,暂停一下，然后慢慢放低身体，回到起始姿势。,"Pause at the top, before slowly lowering yourself back down to the start position."
7764,再次暂停并重复。,Pause again before repeating.
7765,青少年运动员中贫血是不常见的。,Anaemia is unusual in adolescent athletes.
7765,在佩特等（1979)的研究中，来自5个不同大学运动队的46名运动员中未发现贫血。,"In their study of 46 athletes from five varsity college teams, Pate et al. (1979) could find no cases of anaemia."
7765,罗兰和凯莱赫（Rowland & Kelleher，1989) 研究发现，在15名男性和15名女性高中游泳运动员中仅发现1名男孩贫血。,Rowland and Kelleher (1989) reported only one boy with anaemia among 15 male and 15 female high school swimmers.
7766,如果值的范围较大时，我们就会使用分组频率（frequency distribution) 分布来呈现，也就是以小区段来区隔分数，称为频率间隔(frequency intervals)。,"If there is a wide range of values, a grouped frequency distribution is used in which scores are grouped into small ranges called frequency intervals."
7766,举例来说，图6.2a的直方图，呈现了 30位被挑选出来之PGA球员在2008年的平均分数。,"For example, figure 6.2a is a histogram of the scoring averages of 30 selected PGA players in 2008."
7766,球员的平均分数在x轴（底端），每一分数出现的 频率则是以长条的高度呈现在y轴。,"The scoring averages of players are on the x-axis (bottom), and the frequency of each score is represented by the height of the column on the y-axis."
7766,在图中你会观察到，有6位球员每一轮的平均杆数是70.25杆。,You can see by looking at the figure that 6 players averaged about 70.25 strokes per round.
7767,体力活动是儿童和青少年日常游戏的一个重要组成部分，也许男孩比女孩更为突出。但是，随着人们近来对女孩和成年女性在优秀运动员中所扮演角色的认可，对女孩运动能力和女孩参加体育活动的价值的认识有了改变。,"Physical performance is an important component of the behavioural repertoire of children and adolescents, perhaps more so for boys than for girls, although the recent acceptance of girls and women in the role of élite athletes may influence the views of and values attached to physical performance in girls."
7767,运动能力一般是通过各种的运动测试取得的，这些运动测试包括检测诸如速度、平衡、柔靭性、爆发力和局部肌肉耐力等能力；而肌肉力量传统上是用测力计进行静力性力量测试，如握力、拉力、推力测试等。,"Motor performance is most often measured in a variety of gross motor tasks which require abilities such as speed, balance, flexibility, explosive strength and local muscular endurance, while muscular strength is traditionally measured by static dynamometric tests such as gripping, pulling and pushing."
7768,做平卧屈举腿时，平躺在地上，双腿并拢伸展，双手置于身体两侧的地面上。,"In the flat bent leg raise, lie on your back with your legs together and stretched out on the floor.Your hands should be by your sides, and also in contact with the floor."
7768,双腿抬起，膝盖弯曲，使大腿与小腿的夹角大约成45°，双脚距离地面约2-5厘米。,"Raise your legs, bending them at the knee approximately forty-five degrees from the straight alignment.Your feet should be kept an inch or two off the floor."
7768,这是该动作的起始姿势（图65）。,This is the start position (fig. 65).
7768,该练习前半部分的动作包括平缓地抬起双腿和双脚，持续大约2秒钟，直到双脚位于骨盆正上方（图66）。,The positive portion of the exercise involves raising the legs and feet smoothly—over a count of two seconds—until the feet are directly above the pelvis (fig. 66).
7768,在整个动作过程中，膝盖弯曲的角度应该保持不变——始终“锁定”。,"As you move, the angle of the knee should not change; it must remain “locked” in the same position."
7768,双手向下按压地板，这样有助于保持身体稳定。,Pressing down on the floor with the hands will help you stabilize your torso throughout the movement.
7768,两脚位于骨盆正上方时，略作停顿，然后进行反向动作。,"Pause at the top, before reversing the motion."
7768,在回复到起始姿势时也略作停顿，然后重复以上过程。,Pause again in the start position before repeating as necessary.
7768,双脚向上运动时呼气，向下运动时吸气。,"Exhale as the feet move up, inhale as they are moving down."
7768,在整组练习中，腹部始终都要收紧，双脚始终不能接触地面。,Keep the stomach tight at all times.The feet should not touch the floor at all during the set.
7769,在做平卧抬膝时，平躺在地上，双腿并拢，双手置于身体两侧的地板上。,"In flat knee raises, lie flat on the floor, with your legs together and your arms by your side."
7769,膝盖弯曲近90°，双脚距离地面约2一5厘米（1）。,"Bend your knees so that they are at approximately ninety degrees (i.e., a right angle)（1）, with the feet an inch or two off the ground."
7769,双手用力向下按压地板，这样有助于保持身体稳定。,Pressing hard on the floor with your hands will help keep your torso stable.
7769,这是该动作的起始姿势（图63）。,This is the start position (fig. 63).
7769,然后平缓地抬起膝盖，越过髋部，直到大腿与地面垂直、小腿与地面平行，整个过程中膝盖始终接近900（2）。,"Now smoothly bring your knees up over your hips, so that your thighs are perpendicular to the floor, and your calves are parallel to the floor."
7769,在此过程中呼气，腹部肌肉保持收紧。,"Keep the knees at a right angle throughout and exhale as you go, keeping your stomach muscles tight."
7769,这是该动作的结束姿势（图64）。,This is the finish position (fig.64).
7769,暂停1秒钟，进行反向动作。,"Pause for a count of one, before reversing the motion by extending your legs as you lower your feet."
7769,降低双脚，回到起始姿势，并在此过程中吸气。,Inhale as you return to the start position.
7769,在整组练习中双脚都不能接触地面。,"After you begin, at no point throughout the movement should your feet touch the floor."
7770,做平卧直举腿时，平躺在地上，面部朝上。,"In flat straight leg raises, lie on the floor, face up."
7770,双脚并拢，双腿伸直，双手置于身体两侧。,"Your feet should be together, your legs should be straight, and your arms should be by your sides."
7770,抬起双脚，使其距离地面约2到5厘米。,Lift your feet an inch or two from the floor.
7770,双手向下按压地板，以保持身体稳定。,Pressing down with the hands will help you keep your torso stable.
7770,双腿锁定，抬起双脚直到它们到达骨盆正上方，即双腿与上半身的夹角成90°。,"Now, keeping your legs locked, raise your feet until they are directly above your pelvis."
7770,抬脚的过程中呼气，腹部保持收紧。,"Exhale as you lift, keeping the stomach tight."
7770,至少要用2秒钟平缓地完成该动作，不要用猛劲。,It should take you at least two seconds to smoothly accomplish this—don’t explode up.Your legs and torso will form a right angle at this point.
7770,停顿片刻，然后反向动作，降低双腿的过程中吸气。,"Pause briefly, before reversing the motion exactly, inhaling as you go down."
7770,到达起始姿势后略作停顿，再重复。,Pause again in the start position and repeat.
7770,在整个动作过程中，膝盖始终要锁定，双脚不能接触地面，直到一组完成之后方可。,"At no point should allow your knees to unlock, and your heels shouldn’t touch the floor until the set is completed."
7771,我们发现，在确定受试者的低强度运动（在AT水平下活动）和高强度运动 (在AT水平之上的活动）时，无氧阈是有实用价值的。,We have found it useful to consider low intensity exercise as work performed below the subject's AT and high-intensity exercise as above AT work.
7771,"与低强度运动比较，高强度运动会伴有儿茶酚胺和生长激素呈非线性增加的反应，而血糖却会下降（Cooper et al., 1989)。","High-intensity exercise is accompanied by non-linear increases in catecholamines, GH responses, and blood glucose turnover when compared with low-intensity work (Cooper et al., 1989)."
7771,这些研究结果是对运动强度进行相对简单分类的生理基础和实践基础。,These observationsform a practical and physiological basis for this relatively simple division of exercise intensity.
7772,男性生殖器成熟状态的更直接的测定法是测量睾丸的体积。,A more direct estimate of genital maturation in males is provided by measurements of testicular volume.
7772,用一系列已知容积的睾丸模型测定睾丸的大小（普拉德睾丸测量器，Prader orchidometer)。,It is estimated from the size of the testes using a series of models of known volume which have the shape of the testes (Prader orchidometer).
7772,使用这种模型要求在临床检查时医生应直接接触睾丸，将睾丸与某一椭圆球体睾丸模型对照。,Application of the models requires direct manipulation of the testes at clinical examination as the physician attempts to match the size of the testis with the ellipsoid model that most closely matches it.
7773,由特殊细胞（称为起搏细胞）发出的电流，由心脏顶部开始向下流动，刺激心肌，将血液挤出，通过主动脉瓣膜。,Electricity from special cells (called pacemaker cells)—starting at the top of the heart and moving down_stimulates the heart muscle to wring the blood out through the aortic valve.
7773,这就像拧湿毛—样，把水扔出来。,
7773,从心脏中流出的血液自动注入主动脉，主动脉是人体最大的动脉血管，将富含氧气的血液输送到人体其他部分。,"The wave of blood that has been twisted out of the heart is ejected into the aorta itself, the body's largest artery, which carries oxygen*rich blood to the rest of the body."
7774,恰当的时机掌控（Coincidental timing )。,Coincidental timing.
7774,这是使运动行为与一个物体的到达相匹 配的能力。,This is the ability to match a motor action with the arrival of an object.
7774,当球飞过来时，三垒手必须精确计算起跳时机以接住平直球。,The third baseman must time his leap for a line drive at just the right instant when the ball arrives.
7774,为了完成这个动作，他必须有一些估算球速的手段。,"To accomplish this, he must have some means of estimating the velocity of the ball."
7775,髂骨上缘外侧间距是指髂骨上缘最外侧点之间的距离。,Bi-iliocristal breadth refers to the distance between the most lateral points on the superior border of the iliac crest.
7775,测试者面向受试者，用中指寻找骨性标志，并将夹子双臂对准部位。,"Stand in front of the subject, locate the sites with your third digits and apply the branches of the caliper to the sites."
7775,将夹子双臂向上与水平面约呈45°，测量髂骨上缘最外侧点之间的最大距离。,Position the branches to point upward at an angle of about 450 from the horizontal encompassing the largest diameter between the most lateral aspects of the iliac crests.
7775,用食指沿着髂骨侧的两个夹臂施加合适的压力。,A pply firm pressure with your index finger to the branches over the iliac sites.
7776,从盒子到髂前上嵴上缘骨性标志的高度。,Projected height from the box to the iliospinale landmark.
7776,受试者双脚并拢站立，面向盒子的一个角，足跟并拢，双足放在盒子的任一侧。,"The subject stands with the feet together facing a corner of the box, with heels together and feet on either side of the box."
7776,测试者用左手将指示器末端直接与盒子接触，用右手将分段测量计的指示器外鞘垂直向上接触髂前上嵴下缘骨性标志。,Place the end pointer flush on the box with your left hand and extend the housing pointer of the segmometer vertically upward with your right hand to the marked iliospinale landmark.
7777,不过还有一种常见的前列腺问题需要注意：前列腺肥大（BPH)。,But there's also another common prostate disease to be aware of—benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).
7777,从本质上看，就患有前列腺肥大的男性而言，位于尿道附近的前列腺会胀大。尿道是人体的主要管道，能将体内器官排出的废液，输送到体外。,"Essentially, in men with BPH, their prostates enlarge around their urethras—the major road of fluid from the internal organs to the outside world."
7778,前倾跳跃这项技巧训练可使你通过合理利用重力来保持前倾的姿势。,Hop with Forward Lean                                                                                                                                                This drill will help teach you how to properly use gravity with a falling forward lean.
7778,这个练习可以帮助跑者逐渐掌握更紧凑的步幅，纠正原先迈大步和后脚跟落地的跑步方式，保持了重心的稳定性，更大程度上调动了臀部参与发力。,"It transitions runners to a more compact stride; instead of reaching out with the leg and landing on the heel, midline stability is maintained and the hips become more central to the flow of power."
7778,像跳绳一样，开始垂直跳动，注意使用核心力量。,"Begin with small vertical hops, as if jumping rope, engaging the core."
7778,跳动过程中保持身体前倾，保证从脚踝开始前倾，而不是从腰部开始。,"Once you are hopping, allow your body to fall forward, hinging from the ankles instead of the waist."
7778,继续跳动，利用重力使身体向前。,Continue to hop as you allow gravity to move you forward.
7778,你可以把自己想象成弹簧高跷，并且注意利用双脚和脚踝的弹性推动身体。,Imagine that you are a pogo stick; focus on the elasticity in your feet and ankles to propel you.
7778,不要让双脚蹭着地面，保持前倾跳动3-5次，稳定动作之后再跳3次。,"Lean for 3 to 5 hops without scuffing the feet, and then level out for 3 more hops."
7779,全国大学生运动联合会近来对大学运动员的进食障碍给予极大的关注。,The National Collegiate Athletic Association has recently taken a strong interest in eating disorders in collegiate athletes.
7779,他们在1990年发表了有关进食障碍的包含三个部分内容的录像系列，同时发行书面的资料、文章和展板，准备散发给运动行政管理人员、教练员、训练师和运动员。,"They have released a three-part videotape series on eating disorders with accompanying written materials, articles and posters, which are intended to be distributed to athletic administrators, coaches, trainers and athletes."
7779,在这些资料中有一份专门为运动员准备的清单，列举了各种的前驱征侯。,Among these materials is a list of warning signs designed specifically for athletes.
7780,在这本书中，我们花在说明药物治疗上的时间和大多数男性花在前戏上的时间大约是一样的：大约23秒。,"In this book, we've spent about as much time on medication as most men spend during foreplay--roughly twenty-three seconds."
7780,这不是对药物治疗的批评（尽管这是前戏的习惯做法之一），实际上，药品的发展是历史上最重要的医学进步。,"That's not a critique of medication (though it is one of our foreplay customs); in fact, the development of pharmaceuticals is one of the most important medical developments in history."
7780,然而在这本书里大部分是向你展示预防的方法，即在你担心需要逬行药物治疗之前就战胜疾病。,"For the most part, though, we're here to show you methods for prevention--ways to beat the problem before you need to worry about medication."
7781,面对墙壁站立，双脚并拢，双臂伸直，与肩同宽，双手平放在墙上，手掌与胸等高。这是墙壁俯卧撑的起始姿势（图1）。,"Face a wall.With your feet together, place your palms flat against the wall.This is the start position of the wall pushup (fig. 1).Your arms should be straight and shoulder width apart, with the hands at chest level."
7781,弯曲肘部，直到前额轻触墙面。,Bend the shoulders and elbows until the forehead gently touches the wall.
7781,这是该动作的结束姿势（图2）。,This is the finish position (fig. 2).
7782,从工程学的观点看，骨骼是一种非凡的结构材料。,"From an engineering point of view , bone is a remarkable structural material."
7782,"它的强度比最硬的木头、砖块和混凝土还要大（Koch, 1971),同时 又轻巧得容易移动并且坚固得足以支撑物体。","It is stronger than the hardest wood, brick or concrete (Koch, 1971) and yet light enough to allow movementand solid enough to provide support."
7782,它还柔韧有余，能够弯曲和吸收突然的冲击而不轻易破碎。,"It is also flexible, which allows it to bend and absorb sudden impacts without shattering."
7782,"骨骼的构成主要有蛋白质（胶原蛋白，collagen),羟磷灰石 (hydroxyapatite)和水分，每一种成分各占 1/3。","Bone composition is primarily the combination of a protein (collagen), a mineral (hydroxyapatite) and water, with each constituent contributing about one-third by volume."
7783,对于一些年轻人来说，青春期的变化提髙运动表现的现象发生的早，另一些则在青春期后期才出现。,"For some youths, performance-enhancing pubertal changes occur early.Others experience them later in adolescence."
7783,它们的出现也有着不同的速度。,They also occur at different tempos.
7783,有些年轻人会以一种集中的方式很快经过整个过程，然而对于另一些，整个过程则是随着时间渐渐消失的。,"Some youths go through the process very quickly in a concentrated manner, while for others, the entire process is drawn out over time."
7783,性发育水平，它对于运动表现有自己的作用，但它并不是随着年轻人的实际年龄发展的。,"Level of sexual development, with its implications for sport performance, does not follow the youngster’s chronological age."
7784,下肢的迅速伸长是青春生长突增期的早期特点之一。,Rapid growth in the lower extremities is characteristic of the early part of the adolescent growth spurt.
7784,只有少数几份研究报道了两侧肩峰(biacromial)间距和两侧肩脊（bicristal）间距的数据，且结果多不一致。,"Only few studies report data for biacromial and bicristal breadths, and results are variable."
7784,"通常，这两者的最大增长速度均出现在PHV之后 (Beunen & Malina, 1988; Malina et al., 1988) 。","Generally, peak velocity in biacromial breadth occurs after PHV and also after peak velocity in bicristal breadth (Beunen & Malina, 1988; Malina et al., 1988)."
7785,屈臂撑是被认为是锻炼推力肌肉群的动作，的确，这个动作很锻炼胸肌和肱三头肌。,"DipsDips are usually considered to be an exercise for the pushing muscles, and it’s true that they work the pecs and triceps hard."
7785,但由于在这个动作中手臂会向下移动，所以背阔肌也会积极地参与发力。,"But because the arms strongly move downwards during the movement, the lats become significantly involved as well."
7785,我见过一些家伙在练完屈臂撑而不是引体向上后，背阔肌会酸痛。,"In fact, I’ve met guys who get sorer lats from dips than from pullups."
7785,双手抓住双杠或者让双手分别撑在两把椅子上，手臂在身体两侧伸直以支撑身体。,Grab some parallel bars—or position yourself between two chairs—and support your weight on straight arms.
7785,弯曲肘部，直到肘部成直角，暂停一下，然后平稳地把自己撑起来。,"Bend at the shoulders and elbows until your elbows are at right angles, and pause for a moment before smoothly pushing back up."
7785,坐姿屈臂撑（将双脚放在高一点儿的稳固平面上）也能锻炼背阔肌，但这个动作的强度不大，因为你并不需要负担全部的体重。,"Bench dips (dips with the feet up on a stable surface) also work the lats, but to a lesser degree because the total bodyweight isn’t moved."
7786,在2009年，马丁•吉尔巴拉和加拿大的麦克马斯持大学(McMaster University)团队也对HIIT进行了深入研究。,2009 study by Martin Gibala and a team at McMaster University in Canada also took a close look at HIIT.
7786,他们的研究以学生为测试对象，测试内容包含3分钟热身、60秒高强度训练和75秒休息，每组重复8~12轮。,"Their study on students incorporated a 3-minute warm-up, followed by 60 seconds of intense exercise and 75 seconds of rest, repeated for 8 to 12 cycles."
7786,总训练时间为20~29分钟不等，参与测试的学生在2周内每周重复3次该项训练。,"The total workout time ranged from 20 to 29 minutes, with the students repeating the routine 3 times per week for 2 weeks."
7787,人体测量盒子（anthrvpometric box) 一只50cm x 40cm x 30 cm的盒子可以让受试者坐下来测量坐高、胸廓横径或者肱骨和股骨的宽度。,"Anthropometric box.A 50 x 40 x 30 cm box may be used for seating the subject to obtain measures such as sitting height, transverse chest breadth or humerus and femur widths."
7787,已知髙度的盒子配合分段人体测量器可以用于测量延伸身高。,A box of known height is part of the protocol for measuring some of the projected heights in conjunction with the segmometer.
7787,有提手口的长方形盒子能够让测试者依据受试者的不同身材随意转动。,The oblong box with slotted handholds enable the anthro- pometrist to turn the box to accommodate sub­ jects of different size.
7787,此外，它可以当做座位或者让受试者站在上面，便于测量。盒子还可以让检测者站在上面测量身材高大受试者的伸展身高和肩峰间距。,"In addition to providing a place for seating or elevating standing subjects for convenience of measurement, the box also serves as a step for the anthropometrists who may stand on it to obtain stretch stature or biacromial breadth in tall subjects."
7788,人体测量卷尺（anthropometric tape)。,Anthropometric tape.
7788,人体测量卷尺最好是钢制的，最小刻度为mm级，能够容易读出cm数；1.5-2m长，在零刻度前有一个多余部分，卷缩在盒子里，有弹簧自动回缩装置。,"Ideally, the anthropometric tape should be steel, calibrated in easy to read centimetres with millimetre gradation; 1.5 —2 m long with an end tab before the zero marking, enclosed in a case and incorporating a spring for automatic retraction."
7788,"这种卷尺之一叫做 Lufkin, Executive, Thinline 2m W606PM (Cooper Tools，Apex, NC, USA)。","One such tape is the Lufkin, Executive, Thinline 2 m W606PM (CooperTools, Apex, NC, USA)."
7789,认知节奏策略经验丰富的长跑运动员，清楚地明白他们比赛时的感觉。,Cognitive pacing Strategy Experienced distance athletes know how they feel during a race.
7789,参加的类似距离的比赛使他们明白，目前的努力强度会造成终点时有怎样的疲劳程度。,"From having competed in similar distances in the past, they know just how intense such perceptions of effort should be in order to predict exhaustion at the finish."
7789,lkm公路赛最初的一km出现的呼吸闲难、腿部肌肉紧张，会使跑步者意识到他们不能以此节奏完成比赛。,Breathing too hard and experiencing leg-muscle stress in the first kilometer of a 10K race cause runners to conclude that they will not make it at this pace.
7789,因此他们有意识地降低跑速。,They consciously slow their velocity.
7789,相反，如果在比赛早期阶段感觉很舒服，这种感觉会提示运动员加速。,"Conversely, being too comfortable in the early phases of a race signals them to speed up."
7790,当考虑形成框架的过程时，重要的是要意识到，框架不仅能应用到新闻报道的结构和内容上，而且可以应用到个体的认知上。,"When considering processes in framing, it is important to recognize that frames apply not only to the structure and content of media reports but also to individual cognitions."
7790,"正如戈夫曼 (Goffmann, 1974 )解释道，框架是一种设备，这种设备能使受众成员“定位、感知、识别和标记”信息的出现(P.21 )。","As Goffmann (1974) explained, frames are devices that allow audience members to ""locate, perceive, identify and label"" occurrences of information (p. 21)."
7790,心理学家称之为“图式”的认知框架，能够被理解为个体在感知周围环境时所采取的精神捷径。,"Cognitive frames relate to what psychologists term sche- mata, which can be understood as the mental shortcuts individuals take to make sense of their surroundings."
7791,体育运动员受伤，大多会成为媒体报道的头条新闻。女性运动员前卜字韧带撕裂的几率是男性运动员的8倍。女性膝部的生理结构较男性松散，女性的骨骼也从整体上比男性脆弱，这就对稳定性造成了负面影响， 致使女性的韧带更易于撕裂。,"Athletes get all the headlines when they get injured, but women are up to eight times more likely than men to tear their ACL The looser construction of the female knee—ond overall weaker skeleton—can compromise stability and predispose women to ligament tears."
7791,韧带受伤还与月经前后的雌性激素含M变化有一定联系，因此在高中、大学、娱乐界和职业的运动员中，女性韧带撕裂的情况远远多于男性。,"The injuries are also linked to hormonal changes around the time of menstruation, so female high school, collegiate, recreational, and professional athletes end up suffering many more tears than men do."
7792,为了帮助保持湿润，你可以用易溶于水的润滑剂安全地增强润滑作用，如润滑剂或溶脂类的软膏。,"To help add moisture, you can increase lubrication safely with water-soluble lubricants like K-Y jelly or lipid-soluble gels."
7792,对于有些女性来说，雄性激素润肤乳每天两次直接 外用于阴蒂，有助于增强刺激、性欲和性兴奋强度。,"And for some women, testosterone cream—applied directly to the clitoris twice a day—helps increase stimulation, libido, and intensity of orgasm."
7792,（雄性激素驱动着男性和女性的性活动。,Testosterone is a driver of sexuality in both men and women.
7792,随着年龄贈长，雄性激素自然减少，我们将在第章深入探讨激素疗法。,"It naturally decreases as age, and we‘ll discuss hormone therapies in depth in Chapter 11."
7792,然而人们还证实雄性激素对性激素含量低的男性也有效。,But testosterone has been shown to be effective in men whose testosterone levels are judged as low.
7793,体力活动是儿童和青少年日常游戏的一个重要组成部分，也许男孩比女孩更为突出。但是，随着人们近来对女孩和成年女性在优秀运动员中所扮演角色的认可，对女孩运动能力和女孩参加体育活动的价值的认识有了改变。,"Physical performance is an important component of the behavioural repertoire of children and adolescents, perhaps more so for boys than for girls, although the recent acceptance of girls and women in the role of élite athletes may influence the views of and values attached to physical performance in girls."
7793,运动能力一般是通过各种的运动测试取得的，这些运动测试包括检测诸如速度、平衡、柔韧性、爆发力和局部肌肉耐力等能力；而肌肉力量传统上是用测力计进行静力性力量测试，如握力、拉力、推力测试等。,"Motor performance is most often measured in a variety of gross motor tasks which require abilities such as speed, balance, flexibility, explosive strength and local muscular endurance, while muscular strength is traditionally measured by static dynamom etric tests such as gripping, pulling and pushing."
7794,在柔式深蹲过程中，单手抓住某个稳固的物体，以保持平衡。,"In the process of sissy squats, grab something sturdy with one hand, for support."
7794,站立，双脚并拢或几乎并拢，双膝弯曲，髋部锁定，踞起脚尖，上身微微后仰。,"Stand up straight with your feet together or nearly so, and bend at the knees, keeping the hips locked straight.This will require rising onto your toes, and applying a mild backwards lean of the torso."
7794,刚开始做这个动作时，上身容易前倾，你会觉得这个动作特别难，但用不了多久，你做起来就会轻松自如。,"At first this exercise is tricky, because you want to bend forwards at the waist, but eventually you’ll get the hang of it."
7794,做这个动作时，大部分力量通过膝盖传递，所以膝盖弯曲不要超过90°。,"Most of the force is transmitted through the knees, so never bend them more than ninety degrees."
7795,这两种物质已被证实可以改善老鼠的认知能力。,These two substances have been shown to improve cognitive function in mice.
7795,老年灰鼠接受了这两种物质的注射后，在迷宫尽头找到食物的速度，会变得和年轻灰鼠一样快。没注射的老年灰鼠可没那么快。,"When old mice are injected with the substances, they find food at the end of the maze as fast as young mice—and faster than old mice that have not had them."
7795,肉毒碱是一种氨基酸，它促逬了人体细胞间能量的传递。,L-carnitine is an amino acid that helps transfer energy between our cells;
7796,乳房X线照片和PKT扫描可以让小肿瘤现身，虽然它们不能确认癌症，只有活组织切片检查能够做到这点。,Mammograms and PET scans are valuable tools for showing small tumors (though they don't prove cancer; only a biopsy can do that).
7796,人们正在不断地幵发着新的工具以发现癌症。,And new tools for detection are constantly being developed.
7796,"比如说通常的手术性乳房内窥镜检查法（KOBE),是用窥镜放大乳房组织60倍，可以找到比乳房X线照片找到的小一百倍的肿瘤。","The routine operative breast endoscopy (ROBE), for instance, uses a viewing scope to magnify breast tissue up to sixty times its normal size and identify tumors 1/100th the size of what can be picked up on mammograms."
7796,早期探测到乳腺癌的治疗通常可以由乳房肿瘤切除术进 行，即摘除肿块。,"With early detection of breast cancer, the treatment can usually be handled by a lumpectomy—the removal of the lump."
7797,人们正茌不断地开发着新的工具以发现癌症。,And new tools for detection are constantly being developed.
7797,比如说通常的手术性乳房内窥镜检查法（KOBE)，是用窥镜放大乳房组织60倍，可以找到比乳房X线照片找到的小一百倍的肿瘤。,"The routine operative breast endoscopy (ROBE), for in stance, uses a viewing scope to magnify breast tissue up to sixty times its normal size and identify tumors 1/100th the size of what can be picked up on mammograms."
7797,早期探测到乳腺癌的治疗通常可以由乳房肿瘤切除术进行，即摘除肿块。,"With early detection of breast cancer, the treatment can usually be handled by a lumpectomy—the removal of the lump."
7798,食物所发挥的作用之一就是帮你的身体加工处理雌性激素。,One of the ways food can play a role is to help your body process estrogen.
7798,一些不同种类的食物对此会起些作用。,A couple different categories of foods can help.
7798,十字花科食物如花椰菜、白菜、菜花都含有该复合物，这种物质能促成类雌性激素活性，防止乳腺癌。,"Cru-ciferous foods like broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts contain compounds that help produce estrogen-like activity and protect against breast cancer."
7799,,Think of omega-3s as a can of WD-40 for the body.
7799,Ω3脂肪酸就像适用子人体的润滑剂，它可以对关节起到润滑作用，让关有效地工作。关节若是一直保待润滑，老年时关节发生摩擦受阻、挤压磨损或疼痛的几率都会下降。,"Omega-3s are believed to help provide the lubrication that the joints need to function at an effective level By keeping the joints lubed, you experience less friction, less grinding, and less pain as you age."
7799,很多研究表明，03脂肪酸能够缓解关节发炎。,Omega-3s have been shown in repeated studies to decrease inflammation in inflamed joints.
7800,萨金特 (1921)最先发明了通过纵跳测试成人腿部最大功率的试验。,The measurement of maximal leg power by means of a vertical jump was first developed for adults by Sargent (1921).
7800,要求受试者尽可能向上进行垂直跳。,Subjects are required to jump vertically as high as they can.
7800,测试者在垂直跳的最高点用粉笔标上记号。,"At the peak of the jump, the examinee marks the measuring board with chalk."
7800,从跳跃的高度可以计算出受试者竭尽全力所能产生腿部“功率”的能力。,The subject's ability to exert 'power' with the legs is derived from the height of the jump.
7800,3次跳跃的最大值或平均值作为试验的得分。,The best or the average value of three jumps is generally taken as the test score.
7800,纵跳被认为是腿部功率的有效指标。从萨金特试验演化出各种各样的纵跳方案，如跳起-手触墙试验，阿巴拉科夫试验。,"The vertical jump has been accepted as a valid measure of leg power and various vertical jump protocols have been derived from the Sargent test (e.g.jump-and-reach test, the Abalakow test)."
7801,近年来，相对选择性β2-激动剂(β2-agonists)的发展，具有使支气管平滑肌松弛的作用，而对心脏的作用较小。,"Recent years have seen the development of relatively selective β2-agonists, that have potent bronchial smooth muscle relaxant effect, with little cardiac stimulation."
7801,"这些药物，包括（美国）阿布特罗或（世界其他地方）沙丁胺醇,奥西那林，特布他林，比托特罗,非诺特罗和沙米特罗是治疗哮喘中支气管痉挛的主要药物。不论是对慢性的或急性的支气管痉挛，也包括运动性哮喘有效。","These agents, including albuterol (USA) or salbutamol (rest of the world), metaproterenol, terbutaline, bitolterol, fenoterol and salmeterol, are the mainstay in the treatment of the bronchospastic component of asthma, be it chronic or acute, including EIA."
7802,山羊挺身是我推荐的少数需要训练伙伴的练习之一。,The hyperextension is one of the few exercises I advocate which requires a training partner.
7802,趴在餐桌、书桌或较高的台子上，让双腿（直到骨盆）在平面上，上半身从髋部处开始悬空并下垂——与双腿的夹角成90°，你要想保持这个姿势，需要他人压住你的脚踝，以免摔下来。,"Lie face down on a table, desk or high bench, so that your legs are resting on the surface up to your pelvis, but your torso is hanging straight down.Your trunk and legs will form a right angle at the hips.To maintain this position, you’ll need somebody to push down on your ankles so you don’t fall off."
7802,你可以在髋部下面放个垫子或一块毛巾，以增加舒适度。,A cushion or wrapped up towel under your hips is also a good idea to prevent the edge of the table from cutting into you.
7802,双手置于脑后，上半身向上抬起，直到与双腿持平。,"Place your hands behind your head, and raise your torso until it is level with your legs."
7802,坚持此姿势片刻，然后慢慢放低身体，如此重复。山羊挺身能够锻炼腘绳肌、臀肌、髋部和脊椎肌肉，而同时也不会给脊柱造成任何压力。,"Hold this position for a moment before lowering yourself back down again and repeating for high reps. Hyperextensions work the hamstring complex, the glutes, the hips and spinal muscles."
7802,那些由于做大重量硬拉或深蹲而使椎间盘破裂或部分错位的家伙，可以通过该练习锻炼背部肌肉，而不会加重旧伤。,"It’s a handy exercise to know, because it trains all these muscles without transmitting any pressure down through the spinal column.Guys who have ruptured or partially dislocated their discs by doing heavy deadlifts and squats will be able to train their back muscles with this exercise without aggravating their existing injuries."
7803,流感病毒就像一个想要赖在你的沙发椅上借宿的高中同学一样，会使你的生活混乱一些日子后扬长而去。,"The flu virus, like a high school friend who wants to crash on your couch, makes your life miserable for a few days and then hightails it out of there."
7803,至于其他像传染性单核细胞增多症，会使你非常累，但你需要更长时间经历其发展过程。,"Others, like mononucleosis, which makes you extremely tired, take a little longer to run their course."
7803,还有一些如疱疹病毒，它们会想办法存活下来并且安静地待在你的身体里，但是会偶尔突然发作（就像伤风发热时的唇疱疹来来去去的反复）。,"Still others, like the herpesvirus, figure out a way to survive and be quiet within the body but then flare up occasionally (cold sores come and go)."
7804,当血小板碰到血管壁上不平的补丁时，它们会散成颗粒，牢牢地附在血管壁上，像抓救命稻草一样。,"When blood platelet do hit that rough patch, they degranulate and grab onto the lining as if it’s a life preserver."
7804,（如果血管不平是因为皮肤割伤，那你应该很高兴血小板及时赶到，因为它们可以在血管破损处凝血，最终变成伤痂，有利于止血复原。）,"(If the roughness were a cut in the skin, you’d be glad they’d arrived on the scene because they’d be there to make a clot at the end of the blood vessel, which would eventually become a scab that would help you stop bleeding and heal.)"
7805,在运动肌肉中，Po2和pH值较低，而乳酸水平较高。,"In exercising muscle, Po2 and pH are low and lactate concentrations are high."
7805,伤口的内环境具有类似的条件。,Similar conditions can be found in the interior milieu of wounds.
7805,正在愈合的伤口特征是形成新毛细血管和胶原蛋白。大量研究人员对pH值和呼吸气体浓度的变化可能对促生长作用进行了研究。,"The healing wound is characterized by new capillary and collagen formation, and a number of investigators have focused on possible growth-promoting effects of the changes in pH and respiratory gas concentrations."
7805,在组织水平上，伤口愈合和运动引起的合成代谢之间是否存在着共同的机制？,Might there be common mechanisms at the tissue level linking wound healing with exercise-induced anabolism?
7806,背向墙壁（不接触墙壁）站立，身体向后弯曲，双手举过头顶，与墙壁接触，做出第七式的起始姿势（图95）。,"This step begins when you are standing totally clear of the wall, with your back to it.From here, assume the start position you learned for walking down; bend backwards with your hands over your shoulders making contact with the wall (fig. 95)."
7806,然后，如第七式中描述的那样，双手向下“行走”，直到贴着墙根做出标准的桥式（图97）。,"Then walk down the wall as described in Step 7, until you are in a full bridge hold next to the base of the wall (fig. 97).Now it’s time to go back up."
7806,接下来，你需要向反方向运动。,This is done by reversing the movement.
7806,让一只手重新接触墙壁，同时用力推墙壁，之后让另一只手也接触墙壁，位置比之前那只手略高（图98）。,"Place one palm back on the wall, pushing through it.Next, place your other palm above it (fig. 98)."
7806,把双手从地面上转移到墙壁上，是该动作最难的地方。,This transition whereby your palms go from the floor back onto the wall is the hardest part of the technique.
7806,接下来只是交替地把一只手放得比另一只手更靠上一些，顺着墙壁往上“走”。,Now simply place one palm above the other repeatedly as you go back up the wall.
7806,随着身体逐渐伸展，你很可能需要慢慢小步移动向墙壁靠拢，以保证手掌处有足够的压力。,"As your body straightens, you will probably have to take mini-steps back towards the wall to keep a healthy pressure going through your palms."
7806,继续向上“走”，直到身体几乎伸直（图99）。,Continue walking upwards until you are nearly straight (fig. 99).
7806,然后，双手轻轻推墙，再次完全脱离墙壁站立（图100）。,"From here, push gently away from the wall until you are standing totally clear from it again (fig. 100)."
7806,站立、向下“行走”、向上“行走”、再回到站立姿势，这就是一个完整的上行桥动作。,"This cycle—standing, walking all the way down, walking back up, and standing free again—constitutes one single repetition of the wall walking bridges (up)."
7807,我认为每位训练者都应该为每个身体部位准备至少一个爆发式动作。,I’m a big believer that every student of bodyweight training should have at least one explosive movement in their arsenal for each bodypart.
7807,哨兵引体向上便是这种极佳的练习之一。,Sentry pullups are one of the best.
7807,向上跳起抓住横杆，做标准引体向上，但不要在动作最高点停下来，而是继续向上，直到躯干高过横杆。然后下压手臂让其完全伸展并锁定，此时横杆应该位于你的髋部。,"Jump up to a chinning bar and do a full pullup.But don’t stop at the top—keep lifting your torso up until it is over the bar, and then press your arms to lockout so that you are fully extended, with the bar at hip level."
7807,这个动作应该一气呵成——这需要借助惯性来完成。,"This should be performed as one fluid movement, and it will require some momentum to achieve."
7807,这种爆发式引体向上可以锻炼你的背部和肱二头肌，之后向下压动作的过渡过程能够很好地锻炼你的肘部、腕部及前臂，最后的下压部分中，锻炼的肌肉与屈臂撑所锻炼的相同，主要是肱三头肌、胸肌和背阔肌。,"The explosive pullup works the back and biceps, and the circular transitional movement into a downwards press position very powerfully trains the elbows, wrists and forearms.The final part of the technique, the downwards press, works the same muscles as dips; triceps, pectorals and lats, mainly."
7808,心脏就像你家一样，也有“门厅”——心房，储存流入心脏的血液。,"Now, just like your house, your heart also has an atrium, which holds the blood coming into your heart."
7808,当这种相对不太重要的房间发生纤维性颤动时，人们会感到心悸。,"When fibrillation happens in this less critical chamber, folks feel palpitations."
7808,与需要植入AICD的心脏病人不同，这种患者有时需要用其他方法治疗，比如植入起搏器、射频消溶手术或服用药品。药物治疗包括服用降低血液黏度的药品，能够防止不断运动的心房壁上因凝血累积而引发中风。,"Instead of an AICD, these people sometimes need minimally invasive procedures like a pacemaker insertion, ablation or medications including a blood thinner to prevent blood clots that accumulate on the quivering  atrial walls and can cause strokes."
7809,根据身体运动情况不同，每天能量摄入可以变动。,Energy intake may fluctuate from day to day according to physical exercise.
7809,为合理控制血糖，强制性固定、定量和经过测量的膳食是不必要的，从心理上考虑也不受欢迎。,"To impose a fixed, weighed and measured diet is not required for optimal glycaemic control and is undesirable for psychological reasons."
7809,单纯限制碳水化合物摄入的膳食，自然会导致摄入过多的脂肪，因而对血管有害。,A diet that simply restricts the carbohydrate intake automatically results in an excessive intake of fat which is harmful to the blood vessels.
7809,显然，笼统限制能量摄入将妨碍正常的生长发育（Dorchy et al.，1979)。,"Overall energy restriction prevents normal growth (Dorchy et al., 1979)."
7809,运动员必须有一个良好平衡膳食，适合每天的胰岛素活性和身体运动的需要。,"It is necessary for the athlete to have a wellbalanced diet, adapted daily to both insulin activity and physical exercise."
7810,但是，使用合适的公式，身体成分评定可以成为综合评价健康状况、身体素质和运动能力的一个重要组成部分（Boileau et al.，1988)。,"However, when appropriate equations are used, body composition assessment can be an important component in the comprehensive evaluation of health fitness and performance (Boileau et al., 1988)."
7810,脂肪与瘦组织的重量会影响运动能力的事实已得到公认。,It is well recognized that relative amounts of fat and fat-free mass influence performance.
7810,对于采用运动能力测试身体素质试验而言，这一事实有着十分重要的意义。,This fact has important implications for physical fitness testing in which performance-based items are used.
7811,髙水平的身体活动是否能延缓原发性的自然衰老过程是未知的，但目前，没有证据支持这个观点。,"Whether high levels of physical activity can extend the natural, or primary, aging process is not known, but at present, no evidence supports that idea."
7811,就人类而言，这个问题很难通过实施实验来解答。,"The question, of course, would be extraordinarily difficult to address in the experimental setting for human beings."
7811,最好的替代方式是利用动物实验，它们的生存周期较短，并且更容易作为受试者参加长期的实验研究。,"The best we can do is look at animals, who don’t live as long and can be coerced to participate as long-term research subjects more easily."
7812,如果你认为美国存在体重问题，那么中国人的问题还要严重。,"If you think America has a weight problem, pity the poor Chinese."
7812,因为他们历史上经历过长时间的饥荒，生成了预防饥饿的基因，所以对美国人来说造成糖尿病的体重増加数哪怕一点零头，也会造成中国人的糖尿病。,"Because they went through long periods of famine, they developed the genetics to prevent starvation so well that just a small fraction of the weight gain that causes diabetes in Americans causes diabetes in the Chinese."
7812,（在身体综合指数同为27的情况下，中国人患Ⅱ型糖尿病的几率要高60倍。,(At the same BMI of 27; the Chinese are sixty times more likely to have type 2 diabetes.)
7812,）这就是缘于饥饿基因。,That's attributed to starvation genes.
7813,初恋的经历会使你了解到身心连接的强烈体验。,"As you know from your first love, there is a strong mind-body connection."
7813,当你心情愉快的时候，生理感觉也会不同。,You feel different when you're happy.
7813,事实上，心情愉快让你更健康。,"In fact, you’re healthier when you’re happy."
7813,因此我们的情感（尤其指处理生活中非理性事务的态度）能够对身体机能产生非常重大的影响，也就没有什么可奇怪的了。,"So it shouldn't be a surprise that your emotions—specifically, how you handle some of the nonscientific things in your life—can have an enormous impact on the way your body works."
7814,如果你经常乘飞机，就应该每隔两小时起身四处走动一下，或坐在座位上活动腿部。,"If you fly a lot, you should get up and walk around every two hours, or move your feet with exercises at your seat."
7814,这样能够避免产生深静脉血栓（或腿部静脉阻塞）。,Doing so will help you prevent a condition called deep vein thrombosis (or clotted leg vein) that occurs when you're sitting in the same position for a long time.
7814,在固定位置上久坐会出现这种健康问题：腿部不活动，血液凝块就会形成。,"The danger is that without movement, a blood clot can form in the leg."
7814,这种凝块还有时能进入肺部，阻住血液输往肺部（那就糟糕了）。,That clot can then slip up into the lungs and block off their blood supply (that's a bad thing).
7815,贝诺伊特的神话当然是来自于其职业摔跤手的家族传统。,Benoit's myth was surely grounded in his pedigree as a professional wrestler.
7815,当贝诺伊特只是一个加拿大普通少年儿童时，他就展现出了对职业摔跤的巨大的兴趣。他崇拜那些已经成名的摔跤手，比如布雷特“职业杀手”哈特，著名英国摔跤组合斗牛犬的一员，被人们所熟知为“炸药小子”的汤姆•比林顿。,"Benoit showed interest in professional wrestling as a teenager in Canada, idolizing established wrestlers like Bret ""The Hit Man"" Hart and the one-half of famous tag team The British Bulldogs, Tom Billington, who was known as “The Dynamite Kid.”"
7816,疼痛或不适感之所以很难预料（比如，当时拉里•金感到右臂剧痛，而心脏痛时通常不是右侧痛），是因为心脏本身不会感到疼痛；心脏没有专门的痛觉神经纤维，心脏神经不会直接感到疼痛。,"The reason the pain or discomfort can be so unpredictable (the reason, for instance, that Larry King felt intense pain in his right arm, which is not the usual side for heart pain) is that the heart itself does not feel pain; it does not have specific pain fibers.The heart's nerves do not feel pain directly."
7816,不过当心脏发生问题时，心脏神经电活动会变得不稳定。,"But when something is going wrong with the heart, its nerves may become electrically unstable."
7816,当心脏神经通过脊神经时，会让其他神经短路——比如与手臂、胸部或颌部等相连的各处神经。,"And when they cross the spinal column, they may short-circuit other nerves—nerves that connect with your arm, for example, or your chest."
7816,这种神经能传递疼痛的感觉，因此手臂或者是胸部和颌部会疼，只要神经短路的部位都会产生疼痛。,"And those nerves are the ones that transmit the pain impulses.So your arm aches, or your chest; or your jaw; wherever nerves are being shorted out."
7817,人脑受到的早期训练，确实会影响神经细胞的强健与否。,The way we train our brains at an early age actually has an effect on which of those neuron systems will become good and strong and which won't.
7817,（以自闭症患儿为例，根据目前最先进的理论，使用较少的神经链不会脱落，这说明交叠的结构令自闭儿童很难集中注意力，因为脑中同时发生的事情实在太多了。,"(In autistic children, as the current best theory goes, those underused links don't fall off, meaning the jumbled mass makes it hard for autistic children to focus because there too much going on.)"
7817,）这与影响注意力集中的一种神经系统紊乱缺乏注意力综合征(ADD)不同。,This is different from attention deficit disorder (ADD)—a disorder affecting the ability to concentrate.
7817,实际上，我们许多人在儿时都出现过这种问题（但是在几年前，医生几乎无法诊断出这种疾病），很难将注意力集中在一件事情上，这种情况甚至可能会延续到成年。,"Many of us actually had it as kids (but it was rarely diagnosed years ago), and difficulty concentrating on only one subject can be something we carry even into adulthood."
7818,人脑中约有1亿个神经细胞（又称神经元），如果将它们排成一列，长度可以达到4万8千公里。,"You have 100 billion neurons in your brain, which, if stretched out in length, would reach thirty thousand miles."
7818,每个神经细胞都含有要发送到其他神经细胞的信息，这样人体能正常工作。,Each of these nerve cells contains pieces of information that need to be transmitted to another neuron so that your body can properly function.
7818,神经细胞携带信息，但是只有把信息传给其他细胞，这些信息才有用。,"Neurons hold the information, but unless it’s communicated to another neuron, it’s virtually useless."
7819,狂食行为通常包括摄人高热量的食物(糖果），常常不引人注意或秘密地进食。,"The eating binge typically includes high caloric density foods (sweets), usually eaten inconspicuously or secretly."
7819,通过呕吐来缓解腹部不适，但患者能继续狂食行为。,"By using vomiting to relieve abdominal discomfort, the individual can continue the binge."
7819,"与神经性厌食症一样，神经性易饿症也是开始于青春期或成年早期(American Psychiatric Association, 1987)。","As with anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa begins in adolescence or in early adulthood (American Psychiatric Association, 1987)."
7819,易饿症患者的家长常常是肥胖的，而易饿症患者在青春期通常也是肥胖的。,"Parents of bulimics are frequently obese, and bulimics have often been obese during adolescence."
7820,从传统意义上来说，脑部问题可以分为两种情况。,"Traditionally, brain malfunctions have been broken up into two kinds."
7820,其一，脑部机能障碍有明确的生理学、神经学和医学原因，如中风、失忆和帕金森综合征。,"In one, the brain dysfunction has an obvious physiological, neurological, and medical explanation: things like strokes, memory loss, and Parkinson's disease."
7820,其二，神经障碍设有明确的神经学解释，如抑郁症、焦虑和人格分裂。,"In the other kind, the neural dysfunction has no clear neurological explanation: things like depression, anxiety, and personality disorders."
7820,长久以来，这些问题一直令人捉摸不透，因为诊断结论都是不明确和不精准的。,"For years, these types of problems were as murky as floodwaters because their diagnoses were unclear and imprecise."
7820,我们相信，会有越来越多的医学证据指明，造成这些紊乱症状的，都是什么种类的神经障碍问题。,More and more medical evidence will suggest what neurological malfunctions are taking place to cause some of these disorders.
7821,"并非只有“胆结石""和“滚石”乐队这两种“石”会影响我们的生活。",Gallstones and the Rolling Stones aren't the only stones that can change your life.
7821,还有一种“石”会让你痛得昏过去，像橄榄球运动员被对手在肚子上猛顶一下一样。,The other is the one thatll make you keel over like a rugby player who's been kneed in the groin.
7821,尿液含水量过少，会形成小晶体，接着晶体会聚集形成结石，即肾结石。患者在排尿时，背部下侧和腰侧都会剧痛。,Kidney stones form when urine becomes so concentrated that small crystals and then stones are formed—creating intense pain in your lower back and side and when you urinate.
7821,肾结石的主要防治方法是把自己的身体当成一个空的游泳池，将池子装满水，让水冲出来，通过用水稀释结晶体的方法来防止其进一步形成结石。,"The main method of prevention is to treat your body like an empty swimming pool and flood it with water to flush it out, which inhibits the formation of the crystals by diluting them with water."
7822,肾上腺也分泌降肾上腺素和肾上腺素。当你激动时，这两种物质的分泌水平就会上升。,"Your adrenal glands also produce norepinephrine and epinephrine, levels of which rise when you get excited."
7822,在正常的日常生活中，肾上腺素的水平维持在每毫升200至800毫微克（十亿分之一克）。,"In normal daily life, your levels of epinephrine hover between 200 to 800 nanograms per milliliter."
7822,你一定了解那种感觉，就是当你险些遇上车祸时，你会感到脸红、心跳，甚至咒骂那些不长眼睛的并道行驶司机。,"You know that feeling when you narrowly avoid a car accident—when your face feels flushed, your heart races, and you swear at the incompetence of no-look mergers?"
7822,在这种情况下，肾上腺素的水平升至1500到2500毫微克之间。,"In that case, epinephrine levels rise to between 1,500 and 2,500."
7823,★它会使你的血压升高。,★ It increases your blood pressure.
7823,★这会增加心脏病、中风、记忆力减退、肾衰竭、眼睛问题、关节炎和肺病的风险。,"★ It increases your risk of heart attacks, strokes, memory loss, kidney failure, eye problems, arthritis, and lung disease."
7823,★它降低了你对抗感染的能力。,★ It decreases your ability to fight off infections.
7824,肾上腺是位于你的肾脏上方呈三角形的腺体。它们看起来像一顶贝雷帽（见图10.3)。,These are triangular-shaped glands located on the top of your kidneys; they look almost like a beret or even a two-colored plastic hat you'd put on the top of Mr Potato Head (see Figure 11.3).
7824,但是请别把它们奇怪的外表 (和橡皮一样的质地结构）看做不重要的东西。这顶帽子的梢梢倾斜就会造成你体内的激素大乱。,But don't mistake their odd appearance (and eraser-like texture) for lack of importance; a slight tip of the hat would lead to a hormonal riot in your body.
7825,饮食中主要的能量来源是高碳水化合物和加工的食物，也就是说这种饮食经常依靠果葡糖浆（也称精制糖）调味，意味着升糖指数(GI)非常高，这个数值指的是身体处理过后的食物转化成糖原或者血糖的比率。,"The problem with a diet that gets most of its calories from high-carb, processed foods is that it often relies on high-fructose corn syrup (aka refined sugar) for taste and is high on the glycemic index, which measures the rate at which foods are processed by the body and converted into glycogen, or blood sugar."
7825,这种饮食方案的结果是，当吸收的大量糖分进入血液时，我们的身体会奋力进行处理和存储。,"The consequence of this kind of diet is that when we continually dump loads of sugar into the bloodstream, our bodies struggle to process and store this bonanza."
7825,为了能实现这一过程，身体会分泌更多的胰岛素，胰岛素是给肝脏和全身输送糖分的激素。,"To accomplish this, the body releases more and more insulin, which is a hormone that transports sugar to the liver and throughout the body."
7826,虽然传统的和新的身体成分测量方法一般能够提供比较精确的结果，可是它们通常只局限在实验室内使用并且技术昂贵。,"While the traditional and newer body composition methods generally offer better accuracy and precision, their application is normally restricted to a laboratory setting and requires expensive technology."
7826,此外，这些检测需要受试者的合作和（或）冗长的测量程序，这两点对于儿童都可能成为问题。,"Additionally, these measurements may require extensive subject cooperation and/or a lengthy measurement process, both of which can be problematic with children."
7826,因此场地和临床测试十分需要能够提供快速、安全、便宜和精确的身体成分检测的方法。,"Methods which provide rapid, safe, inexpensive, accurate and precise body composition measurements are needed for clinical and field testing."
7826,在这个意义上，有3种最常用的方法可供使用：体重指数、人体测量技术和生物电阻抗分析法。,"In this context, the three most frequently utilized methods are the body mass index (BMI), anthropometry and bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA)."
7827,如果是大脑的潜意识在控制节奏，它就必须有密切监视时间流逝的能力。,"If the subconscious brain controls pace, it must have the ability to closely monitor the passage of time."
7827,这个中央控制器必须知道你在比赛中跑过的距离和时间，否则它不能有效地运作。,Such a central controller cannot operate effectively unless it is aware of the distance you’ve run and the time that’s passed in the race.
7827,这意味着，我们所有的人都必须有一个可靠的生物钟。,"That means we must have, in all of us, a reliable, internal clock."
7827,那么，这是我们在本书中第一次谈到内在计时机制和生物钟，它们决定了运动表现，之后，我们会发现更多的证据。,"This, then, is our first encounter in these pages of intrinsic timekeeping mechanisms, clocks that dictate exercise performance.Before we reach the end, we will find evidence for many more."
7828,假如是说女明星黛米•摩尔（《人鬼情未了》女主角），这个论断就是真的。,"Well, in Demi Moore's case, it may be true."
7828,嗓音沙哑往往是声带在发生变化，特別是那些常常大声说话的人，比如学校老师和球队教练，就更得当心了。,"But hoarseness can signify actual changes of your vocal cords, especially in people who often speak loudly, like schoolteachers and football coaches."
7828,当吸烟或嗓子用得过多时（职业歌手，即使是那些对型唱歌的，就被医生告诫不得吸烟，不得用嗓过多），声带过度劳累，会留下伤痕，伤痕随即还会增生，称为息肉。,"When you smoke or strain your voice (which professional singers—even those who lip-synch—are taught not to do), you irritate the vocal cords and form scars and subsequent overgrowths that are called polyps."
7829,随着年龄增长，我们都会有健忘的时候。,"As we get older, everyone has bouts of forgetfulness."
7829,你甚至还会忘记很重要的事情，而且这些事情似乎都是很容易就能记的，比如朋友的名字、结婚周年纪念日、最爱乐队的名字（“就是那个四人组合，呃，发型很糟的……怎么就是想不起来呢？”）。,"You might even forget things important to you and seemingly simple to remember, like names of friends, the date of your anniversary, the name of your favorite band (You know, the four guys, c'mon, bad haircuts...).Anyway, age-related memory loss is normal."
7829,不管怎样，我们不需要被动地接受自然衰老的结局（“啊，想起来了，是‘甲壳虫’乐队组合！”），我们可以想办法防止与衰老有关的失忆发生。,"But, as we'll outline later in the chapter (the Beatles!), we don't have to accept normal aging and we can take steps to prevent age-related memory loss."
7830,湿球温度是最常用的热应激的指标，它考虑到了气温、湿度和太阳辐射三个条件。,"The most commonly applied heat stress index is the wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT), which takes into account temperature, humidity and solar radiation."
7830,用于测量这三种指标并计算出WBGT的便携式热应激检测器已有商品出售，我们向所有户外运动项目的组织者推荐使用这种产品。,Portable heat stress monitors which measure these three variables and compute WBGT are commercially available and are recommended for all organizers of outdoor athletic events.
7830,表23.5列举了根据WBGT指数修改户外活动的意见。,"Modification for outdoor activities, according to the WBGT index are outlined in Table 23.5."
7831,坚持这个痛苦的姿势10秒钟，尽可能绷紧背部肌肉。,"Hold this painful pull, squeezing the back muscles as hard as you can, for ten seconds."
7831,暂停5秒钟，重复动作5次。,"Pause for five seconds, before repeating.Do this exercise five times."
7831,十字架式是绝佳的收尾动作，无需其他装备，一分钟内完成四个动作周期，就能让你肌肉酸痛、汗流浃背。,"Crucifix pulls are a brilliant finisher; although they will leave you sweating and in pain, they require no kit, and four cycles will take under a minute."
7832,2000年，Maurice Greene (莫里斯•格林） 美国世界冠军和奥运冠军的短跑名将，并且曾经是世界上跑得最快的人——把他在Gaz de France (法国燃气公司）田径大奖赛上输给葡萄牙选手Francis Obikwelu (弗朗西斯•奥比克维鲁）的结果归咎于时差。,"2000.U.S. world and Olympic champion sprinter Maurice Greene, once the world’s fastest man, explains that jet lag was to blame for his loss to Portugal’s Francis Obikwelu in the 100 meters at the Gaz de  France track meet."
7832,2002年，他退出在法国举行的100m大奖赛的比赛，理由是时差导致了他在预赛中平庸的10.56s的成绩。,"In 2002, he withdraws from the Grand Prix 100-meter event in France, citing jet lag as responsible for his mediocre time of 0:10.56 in the heats."
7832,2004年，他在法国再次输给了Obikwelu，他抱怨说由于跨境飞行，他的身体十分疲惫。,"In 2004, he again loses to Obikwelu in  France, complaining that his body was very tired from his overseas flight."
7833,毫不夸张地说，时间是最重要的。,"Time is, quite literally, of the essence."
7833,实际上，它为我们生活在这个星球上划出了许多界限。,"Indeed, it creates the very boundaries of our lives on this planet."
7833,从我们出生的那刻起，沙子就开始从沙漏不断地流出，一直记录到我们离开的那个点，从不间断。,"From the moment of our birth, the sand begins to flow without ceasing through the hourglass to mark the point of our exit."
7833,在这段时间中，我们用所做的一切来标记时间，包括睡觉、吃饭、工作、度假等等。,"In between times, we mark time in all that we do—our sleeping, eating, working, vacations."
7833,显然，再没有其他任何因素可以定义我们的存在。,"Clearly, no other single factor so defines our existence."
7833,难怪历史上伟大的思考者，包括哲学家、数学家、诗人、神学家和物理学家都一直在努力了解时间的本质。,"No wonder, then, that the great thinkers—philosophers, mathematicians, poets, theologians, physicists—have struggled throughout history to understand the nature of time."
7833,时间是我们都知道的东西。,Time is something we all know about.
7833,但它究竟是什么？,But what is it?
7834,根据以前的场景，我们都体验了这样那样的时间观念，它们提醒我们掌控我们每天的活动和决定。,"The previous scenario, which we’ve all experienced in one form or another, reminds us how an acute perception of time governs our daily activities and decisions."
7834,事实上，很难想到任何不涉及时间感觉的活动。,"Indeed, it’s difficult to think of any action that doesn’t involve some kind of temporal sense."
7834,我们需要在空间 和时间上洞察周围的环境。,We need to perceive our environment in both spatial and temporal realms.
7834,你要等多久的红灯，才会意识到它坏了，然后直接穿过马路？,How long do you wait for the red light to change before realizing that it’s malfunctioning and driving on through?
7834,你是如何安全地穿过一条繁忙的街道的？,How do you safely cross a busy street?
7835,由于食物对消化的影响如此之大，我们有理由进一步推论: 只要想出哪些食物在为健康制造障碍，我们就能改变自己的生活质量，让自己感觉更好。,"Since food has so much of an influence on our digestion, it stands to reason that you can change the way you live and feel by figuring out the foods that are causing you trouble."
7835,鉴于可供挑选的食物品种繁多，最好的检验办法是食品排除法测试。,"Since there are so many foods to choose from, the best way to experiment is through the food-elimination test."
7835,在这个测试里，大约每隔三天，你就能彻底排除掉一组食品。,"In this test, you completely eliminate one group of foods for about three days in a row."
7836,每个人都会随着一年年生日的过去而同步衰老，这就是你的“日历年龄”。,Everyone ages at the same rate with birthdays every year—that's your calendar age.
7836,但是，你却可以通过选择不同的生活方式让你的时钟走得快些或是慢些。生活方式的选择会因为不同的人对待身体的方式和给身体输送的东西不同而有所差别。,But you have the power to turn your clock faster or slower with the lifestyle choices you make regarding what you do with your body and what you put into it.
7836,比如有一位50岁的女性，抽烟让她的肺里充满了尼古丁，她的食物结构也基本是以肝泥和香肠为主。这些对身体的糟踏使她拥有的是一个65岁女性的身体。而如果一个50岁的女性饮食健康，远离毒素，并且进行适量的体育锻炼，照顾好自己的身体，那么她的身体和健康状况就相当于一个36岁的女性。,"For example, a fifty-year-old who douses her lungs with nicotine and builds her food pyramid with chopped liver and sausage actually may have the body of a sixty-five-year-old because of the destruction she's doing, while a fifty-year-old who eats well, stays away from toxins, and takes care of her body with moderate physical activity could have the body and health of a thirty-six-year-old."
7837,消化系统食物中毒就像人体内刮起一阵破坏力极强的飓风，曾经食用变质肉食而整晚腹泻的人是最清楚不过的。,Anybody who’s had a bad piece of meat or fish that led to a one-night stand with a toilet knows all too well the typhoon that swirls in your digestive system from a bad case of food poisoning.
7837,在美国，食物中毒每年会造成2500人死亡，通常是由于外来细胞侵入人体所致。常见的临床表现为呕吐和腹泻，患者很可能会对这种痛苦经历印象深刻。,"Responsible for twenty-five hundred deaths every year in the United States, food poisoning—caused by the invasion by foreign bacteria of your system—usually manifests itself with vomiting, diarrhea, and your promise to swear off the culprit forever."
7838,横向研究设计（cross-sectional studies）为同一时间点对不同年龄受试者进行测验(例如6、8 、10岁儿童)，与纵向研究相较之下，可花费较少时间来执行此类研究。,"Cross-sectional studies are usually less time-consuming to carry out than longitudinal studies.Cross-sectional studies test several age groups (e.g., 6, 8, and 10) at the same point in time."
7838,但是 ，虽然横向研究比纵向研究具备时间上的经济效益，横向研究的限制是有所谓世代问题(cohort problem)的存在。所谓世代问题，指的是在同一时间点接受调查的各族群，是否在当时也都具备了同样的条件与环境？换句话说，各年龄层的受试者都是来自同一个母群体吗？,"Although these studies are more time efficient than longitudinal studies, a limitation called the cohort problem exists: Are all the age groups really from the same population (group of cohorts)?"
7838,举例来说，影响现今6岁儿童垂直跳成绩的学习条件与环境，跟现今的10岁儿童在当他们6岁时，所有学习条件与环境是一样的吗？或者应该这么解释，所有可能会影响现今6岁儿童垂直跳成绩的外在环境条件，在现今10岁儿童当时是6岁时，也都存在吗？有无可能在经过了4年后，体育课程又有了一些更创新的教学、指导与练习方法，所以现今6岁的儿童可以学习更先进的有关垂直跳之观念与技术指导，而这些都是现今10岁儿童在4年前无法学到的新知识、技术指导与练习方式，这就叫做世代问题。,"Asked another way, Are the environmental circumstances that affect jumping performance for 6-year-olds the same today as when the 10-year-olds were 6, or have physical education programs improved over this 4-year span so that 6-year-olds receive more instruction and practice in jumping than the 10-year-olds did when they were 6?"
7839,发展初步假设与进行粗略检定，通常使用横断性研究设计(cross-sectionaldesign)与生态性研究(ecologicalstudy)等简单的描述性研究 (descriptive studies)。,Initial hypotheses are developed and crudely tested using simple descriptive studies that use cross-sectional and ecological study designs.
7839,更为精细的研究设计则进一步运用于研究(analytical studies)，以 验证特定的研究假设。,More refined study designs can then be used to test specific hypotheses in analytical studies.
7839,分析性研究使用个案对EfS(case-control)与世代 (cohort)研究等设计，且死亡率或疾病发生率通常是其研究的依变项。,"Analytical studies use case-control and cohort study designs, and mortality or disease incidence is often the dependent variable for the investigations."
7839,上述两种研究设计作为流行病学研究的重要工具，在过去50年被广泛使用，并累积坚实的研究证据支持这些方法。,"These two designs, the workhorses of epidemiological research, have been used for the last 50 years, and a solid body of evidence has been amassed to support their basic methods."
7840,如果曾经有一个运动员是时间的奴隶，那他就是芬兰伟大的跑步选手帕沃•鲁米。,"If ever there was an athlete who was a slave to time, it was the great Finnish runner Paavo Nurmi."
7840,鲁米的成就，包括了25项世界纪录和9枚奥运会金牌（从1500m到20000m项目），这些成就让一些人认为他是历史上最伟大的长跑运动员。,"Nurmi’s achievements, which included 25 world records and 9 Olympic gold medals (in distances from 1,500 to 20,000 meters), have caused some to consider him the greatest distance runner in history."
7840,他也是唯一一个以名字命名小行星的跑步运动员。,He’s also the only runner to ever have an asteroid named after him.
7840,鲁米的比赛理念是集中精力在时钟上。,Nurmi’s philosophy during racing was to focus entirely on the clock.
7841,运动员可能需要经历系统的脱敏阶段，从消除单纯的焦虑过渡到消除专项运动复杂焦虑，这在一定程度上保证运动员能够随着生物学上的愈合与机体康复在心理上对重返赛场做好准备。,"An athlete may follow a system of desensitization hierarchies from simpler through more difficult anxieites that are sport-specific, at a rate that ensures that the athlete will be psychologically ready to return to sport by the time of completion of biological healing and physical rehabilitation."
7841,心理、愈合与康复这三项进程需要协调进展，同时为重返赛场做好准备。,"The three processes should be coordinated so that emotions, healing and rehabilitation are all prepared for return to activity at approximately the same time."
7841,运动员应在放松状态下通过脱敏阶段，想象每一步骤的成功完成，以视觉化的方式进行康复。,"The athlete proceeds by means of visualization through the desensitization hierarchy, imagining successful completion of each step while remaining in a relaxed state."
7842,有视力损害的运动员要佩戴合适的护目镜，这一点非常重要。,It is critical that athletes with visual impairment use appropriate protective eyewear.
7842,过去对功能性单眼的认定有些武断。,"In the past, the definition of the functionally one-eyed ahtlete has been somewhat arbitrary."
7842,在美国，多数州不会将驾驶执照颁发给矫正视力低于20/50的人。,Most States in the USA will not issue a driver's lisence to anyone with a corrected visual acuity that is worse than 20/50.
7842,因此，单眼最佳矫正视力低于20/50也被认为是功能性单眼。,"Therefore, anyone with best corrected vision in one eye that is worse than 20/50 should be considered functionally one-eyed."
7843,如果你留意一下眼睛的生理构造，你就会发现一些人类与动物之间最主要的区别。,"If you look at the revolutionary anatomy of eyes, you'll notice some major differences between humans and animals."
7843,比如说，人类的两只眼晴比其他许多动物的眼睛都靠得更近些，这使我们有极佳的视角深入地观察。,"For one, huamns have their eyes set closer together tham many other animals, which gives us wonderful depth perception."
7843,而我们换来的是一些重要的外围视线的丧失，这些外围视线能够保护动物，比如牛，就是如此。,"In exchange, we lose some of the great peripheral vision that protects cows."
7843,从某种程度上说，这使人类成为一种视线缺损的物种，因为我们拥有的是双视线。,"In a way, that makes us a species with blinders on—because we have binocular vision."
7844,试题反应理论则建立在比古典测验理论更强的假设下。,IRT is based on stronger assumptions than CTT is.
7844,两个主要的假设分别是单向度(unidimensionality) 与局部独立性 (local independence) 。,The two major assumptions are unidimensionality and local independence.
7844,单向度表示只有单一能力或特 质被测量。,Unidimensionality means that a single ability or trait is being measured.
7844,"这个能力无法被直接测量,因此试题反应理论有时又称为潜在特质理论(latem trait theory) 。","This ability is not directly measurable, so IRT is sometimes referred to as latent trait theory."
7845,"在古典测验理论中,项目难度是以全体回答的结果来测量。","In CTT, item difficulty is measured as a function of the total group."
7845,"而在试题反应理论中,项目难度是固定的,而且可以由对应的受试者能力水准来评量。","In IRT, item difficulty is fixed and can be assessed relative to an examinee’s ability level."
7845,"因此 ,特定能力的受试者能正确回答一个题目的机率,便可以数学的方式被描绘成一条试题特征曲线(item characteristic curve, Iconvict conditioning )。","Thus, the probability that an examinee with a particular ability level will make a correct response to an item can be mathematically described by an item characteristic curve (Iconvict conditioning)."
7845,"对个别题目而言,试题特徵曲线是一条由左向右渐增的非线性迴归曲线,表示答对的机率随著能力或是潜在特质的提高而增加。","The Iconvict conditioning is a nonlinear regression for any item that increases from left to right, indicating an increase in the probability of a correct response with increased ability, or latent trait."
7846,"患有更为复杂的心律失常的患者，包括心房扑动和心房颠动，交界区心动过速，室性心动过速（ventricular tachycardia)或多源性室性心律失常,在允许参加运动之前，必须到心脏病科进行检查和接受必要的治疗。","Individuals who experience more complex dysrhythmias, including atrial flutter and fibrillation, junctional tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia or multifocal ventricular dysrhythmias, should be referred to a cardiologist for evaluation, and possible treatment, before athletic participation is allowed."
7846,心律失常可能与结构性先天性心脏缺损有关联。,Dysrhythmias may be associated with structural congenital heart defects.
7846,这些患者在允许参加运动之前，必须得到心脏病科医生的检查和治疗。,These individuals should be under the care of a cardiologist before physical activity is allowed.
7847,"一种比较复杂的心律失常是室性早搏(premature ventricular contraction, PVC)。",A more complex dysrhythmia results from premature ventricular contraction (PVC).
7847,室性早搏是心室内的一个兴奋灶引发的一次提早的搏动。,"In this situation, a focus in the ventricle initiates a premature contraction by the ventricle."
7847,在听诊时，心律不规则，在不规则心跳之后出现一个“代偿间歇”。,"On auscultation, the rhythm is irregular and is followed by a 'compensatory pause'."
7847,在长代偿间歇前的心跳常常是很有力的，患者会感觉到漏掉了一次心跳。,The beat following the compensatory pause is often more forceful and is perceived by the individual as a skipped beat.
7848,末经过巴氏灭菌的酸奶里含有嗜酸性乳酸菌。这种有益健康的细菌把牛奶变成酸奶，并去除与真菌相关的感染。,Yogurt that hasn't been pasteurized contains Lactobacillus acidophilus—a healthy bacteria that turns milk into yogurt and fights off fungus-related infections.
7848,或者你可以以补充剂形式每天分两次服用20毫克的嗜酸菌，它能帮你防止真菌在你体内的过多增长。,Or you can take acidophilus in supplement form of 20 milligrams twice daily.It works by helping to prevent the overgrowth of fungi that shouldn't be able to grow in your body.
7849,"从事青年体育教育和运动训练的工作者一定会熟悉下面的现象：男孩A是13.5岁，身高171 cm,体重60 kg，上臂拉力65 kg；而男孩B也是13.5岁，身高150 cm，体重40 kg,上臂拉力只有32 kg。","Those engaged in education or coaching of youths are certainly familiar with the following scenario: boy A who is 13.5 years old, has a stature of 171 cm, weight 60kg and a static strength score of 65 kg on an arm pull test, while boy B who is also 13.5 years old, has a stature of 150 cm, weight 40 kg and a strength score of 32 kg."
7849,但是通常总是要求日历年龄相同的男孩在一起进行各种各样的集体和个人运动项目比赛以及接受同样的身体素质测试。,
7849,"改1：从事青年体育教育和运动训练的工作者一定会熟悉下面的现象：男孩A是13.5岁，身高171 cm,体重60 kg，手臂拉力65 kg；而男孩B也是13.5岁，身高150 cm，体重40 kg,手臂拉力只有32 kg。",
7849,但是通常总是要求日历年龄相同的男孩在一起进行各种各样的集体和个人运动项目比赛以及接受同样的身体素质测试。,"These boys of exactly the same CA are often required to compete against each other in a variety of team and individual sports, and often on fitness tests."
7850,此外，许多性专科医生认为手淫对健康有益，比 如，手淫可以缓解紧张。,"In addition, many sex therapists believe that masturbation can improve your health—by relieving stress, for instance."
7850,但是，专家们警告说，手淫绝不能代替与伴侣的性爱。,"What they do warn, though, is that masturbation should never be a substitute for sexual activity with your partner."
7850,另一方面，没有确切证据能表明手淫对前列腺肥大作用是正是负。,"On the other hand, there's no dear evidence showing a beneficial or harmful effect of masturbation on benign prostatic hyperplasia."
7851,发达国家的人均寿命的大幅上升——在美国，平均寿命由19世纪中叶的40岁增加了一倍，达到现在的大约80岁——完全是因为继发性衰老的延迟。,The progressive rise in longevity in developed nations—doubling in the United States from an average of about 40 years in the mid-1800s to around 80 years at present—is due entirely to a delay in secondary aging.
7851,明显的原因是，在过去的150年，健康护理、医疗系统和设备，以及营养方面得到了的巨大改善。,"The obvious explanation is the dramatic improvements in health care, sanitation, and nutrition that have occurred over the past 150 years."
7851,然而， 原发性衰老的过程并未随着时间而改变。,"It is probable, however, that the natural course of primary aging in human beings has not changed over time."
7851,我们将在随后的部分讨论这个话题。,We’ll discuss this a bit more later.
7852,体操动作会自然地利用关节，从而使关节与肌肉协调发展。,"The authentic movements offered by calisthenics apply the power of the joints naturally, as they evolved to be used."
7852,久而久之，你的关节就会更加强劲有力，而不会饱受折磨、越来越弱。,"The result is that they develop in proportion to the muscular system, becoming more powerful over time rather than weaker and worn down."
7852,随着你的关节组织逐步修复，原来的老伤旧痛会一扫而去，以后你也就不会轻易受伤了。,"As the joint tissue rebuilds itself, former aches and pains are worked out of the system, and future injuries are avoided."
7853,手术会切除掉部分阻碍气管的组织，帮助患者提高呼吸质量，治愈睡眠呼吸暂停综合征。另外有助瘦身的手术（即缩小胃部手术）也很有效，它可以治愈严重的睡眠呼吸暂停综合征。,"Surgery removes some of the obstructing tissue, which helps you breathe better and cure the apnea, and procedures that help you lose weight (that is, gastric bypass surgery) are also effective and can help some people who have severe sleep apnea."
7853,不过，你自己就可以给呼吸状况带来最大程度的改善。,But the biggest change can come from you.
7853,体重只要减轻4.5公斤，呼吸暂停的频度就可以减少30%，而体重增加4.5公斤结果就正相反。由此可知，瘦身比手术还有效。,"Losing just ten pounds can decrease your episodes of sleep apnea by 30 percent, while gaining ten pounds does the reverse —making weight loss even more effective than surgery."
7854,消化系统有两种激素分别控制饥饿感和食欲。,Your digestive system has two main hormones that control hunger and appetite.
7854,饥饿激素由胃部分泌，能够增强食欲。,Ghrelin is secreted by the stomach and increases your appetite.
7854,胃部变空，就会把饥饿激素派出去索要食物。,"When your stomach's empty, it sends ghrelin out requesting food."
7854,瘦素则会告诉大脑饱了。当人进食的时候，脂肪细胞会分泌瘦素，让人停止进食。,"Leptin tells your brain that you're full When you eat, your fat cells secrete it so that you stop eating."
7855,这些物质对免疫系统是有益处的，它们同时也有利于防止白内障的发生。,"There've been shown to be helpful for your immune system, but they're also helpful for protecting against cataracts."
7855,翻翻第10章看一看那些列出的含有非凡 功用的类黄酮的食物。,See Chapter 10 for a list of the foods that contain powerful flavonoids.
7855,许多水果和蔬菜中含有维生素C和生物类黄酮。有证据证明丰富的食谱内只需每天含有四份水果，就会使你的生理年龄年轻4岁之多。,"Many fruits and vegetables contain C and bioflavonoids, and there's evidence that eating a diverse diet that includes just four servings of fruits a day can make your REAL AGE as much as four years younger."
7856,衰老的种类在讨论衰老这个话题之前，应该让聪明的读者了解一些重要的概念和注意事项。,"Categories of agingBefore launching into our topic, the discerning reader should be aware of certain important concepts and cautions."
7856,首先，应该意识到存在两种衰老的类型。,"To start with, it should be recognized that two kinds of aging exist."
7856,原发性衰老是一种人类组织固有的过程，不受疾病和环境因素支配，在这个过程中，细胞的完整性和功能会随着时间而衰退，最终通向死亡。,"Primary aging is an intrinsic process of all human tissues, independent of disease and environmental factors, in which progressive deterioration of cellular integrity and function over time eventually leads to death."
7857,一个特别有趣的观察似乎包含了许多衰老机制的理论。,One particularly intriguing observation seems to reside over many of the theories about the mechanism of aging.
7857,本书的引言简短地提到了这一点：动物静息时的新陈代谢率与他们的身体大小和寿命呈负相关。,The introduction to this book mentions this briefly: The resting metabolic rate of animals is inversely related to both their body size and their life span.
7857,小动物每千克体重有着一个更髙的新陈代谢率，并且相比于大的动物，其寿命更短。,Smaller animals have a higher metabolic rate per kilogram of body mass and a shorter life span than larger ones.
7858,这种爆发式引体向上可以锻炼你的背部和肱二头肌，之后向下压动作的过渡过程能够很好地锻炼你的肘部、腕部及前臂，最后的下压部分中，锻炼的肌肉与屈臂撑所锻炼的相同，主要是肱三头肌、胸肌和背阔肌。,"The explosive pullup works the back and biceps, and the circular transitional movement into a downwards press position very powerfully trains the elbows, wrists and forearms.The final part of the technique, the downwards press, works the same muscles as dips; triceps, pectorals and lats, mainly."
7858,一旦你的手臂已经完全伸直，就落下来并重复以上动作。,Drop back down and repeat the exercise once your arms are straight.
7858,刚开始练习的时候，你主要是靠跳起来的惯性完成动作转换，但随着你不断变强，对跳跃的依赖就会越来越少。,"In the early days, you’ll find yourself jumping hard to achieve the transition, but you’ll do this less and less as you get stronger."
7858,有些人称之为双力臂动作。,"In some circles, this exercise is called the muscle-up."
7858,我是在圣昆汀学到这个动作的，那儿的囚徒们将其称之为“哨兵引体向上”，但我在其他地方从没听过这样的称呼。,"In San Quentin, where I first learned this technique, the convicts called them “sentry pullups,” although I’ve never heard the name anywhere else."
7859,赛后应提供液体来补充水分，用复合碳水化合物来促进糖原储备的恢复。,"After exercise, fluids should be offered to promote hydration and complex carbohydrates encouraged to replenish glycogen stores."
7859,一些家长不适当地向自己的孩子提供食品来奖 励他们的好成绩。,Some parents may inappropriately use food as a bribe to encourage a winning performance.
7859,必须告诫家长不能采用特殊的待遇来奖励出色的儿童，至少应该有所克制。,Parents should be advised that special treats should not be used to reward a child that does well and withheld if not.
7859,儿童无论是否成功完成比赛，都与赛后用餐无关。,Whether the child competed successfully or not should have no bearing upon post-exercise intake.
7860,水平俯卧撑其实并不是真正意义上的俯卧撑。,The plank is not really a pushup.
7860,它是生活在第二个黄金时代的大力士所钟爱的静力绝技之一，而且它的历史可以追溯到更早的时候。,"It’s a static feat of strength that was a favorite amongst the strongmen of the second Golden Age, although it stretches back much further than that."
7860,那时的人喜欢这本亏趁是因为：水平俯卧撑对身体素质有很高的要求，不但每一块肌肉都有要强劲有力，而且还要有较高的平衡能力与协调能力。,"The old-timers loved this exercise, and not without reason—the plank requires strength in almost every single muscle of the body, as well as balance and coordination."
7860,此外，这也是个很酷的聚会特技。,"Besides which, it makes for a cool party trick."
7860,双手撑地，与肩同宽，双臂弯曲，肘部内收，贴在身体两侧，然后身体前倾，直到双脚离地，双腿镇定。,"Place your palms on the floor shoulder width apart, bend your arms, tucking your elbows into your torso, and lean forwards until your feet are off the ground with the legs locked."
7861,在生长过程中出现的过度使用损伤通常被称为过度生长损伤。,Injuries incurred as a result of the growth process have been referred to as overgrowth injuries.
7861,1/3的用力性损伤是生长障碍或骨软骨病。,"One-third of the so-called exertion injuries were growth disturbances or osteochondroses (Orava & Puranen, 1978)."
7861,患骨软骨病的儿童，如奥-施氏病（胚骨粗隆骨软骨病）、朔伊尔曼氏病（脊柱骨软骨病）、潘纳尔氏病（青年畸形性跖趾骨软骨炎）、股骨头骨骺骨软骨病，可能会因为不同原因就诊。,"Children with osteochondroses, e.g.Osgood-Schlatter disease, Scheuermann's disease, Partner's disease and Legg-Calvé—Perthes disease, may have different reasons for seeking health care."
7862,你曾经听说过拥有第六感官的事儿，但是你也许拥有第三只眼睛。,"You've heard of having a sixth sense, but you also may have a third eye."
7862,东方神话有时在人的额头中间描出第三只眼睛。,Eastern religions sometimes portray people with an eye in the middle of their forehead.
7862,亊实上，它与你的大脑的松果体处于同一位置。,"Turns out, that's located in about the same spot as the pineal gland in your brain."
7863,素食者是很长时间不吃肉的一类人，他们再吃肉时会产生排斥。,Vegetarians who haven't eaten meat in a long time don't like it if they try it again.
7863,这是因为从他们的唾液腺到胃腺和小肠腺，都 不再分泌与消化肉类相对应的一系列酶，人体无法顺利消化肉食。,That's because they don't secerte the right mix of enzymes from the salivary galnds to the stomach's digestive enzymes and small intestine to optimally digest meat.
7863,素食者吃肉时，身体就会发生一种反应：肉食感觉很重，无法正常消化，因此感觉不舒服，对肉产生排斥。,"That triggers a reaction when you do eat it: it feels heavy, you don't digest it as well, so you don't feel good and you don't enjoy it."
7864,糖尿病不是一个病，而是有多种 同原因的一个综合征。,"Diabetes mellitus is not a disease, but a syndrome with a number of different causes."
7864,高血糖症和糖尿是临床上的特点。,"Clinically, it is characterized by hyperglycaemia and glycosuria."
7864,如果不经过治疗，会发展为酸中毒和酮中毒（酮症），脱水， 昏迷和死亡。,"If untreated, it may progress to acidosis and ketosis, dehydration, coma and death."
7864,少年糖尿病是胰腺P-细胞内源性胰岛素供应不足引起的，所以要用胰岛素进行治疗。,Diabetes of juvenile onset is usually due to a deficiency in the endogenous supply of insulin by the pancreatic (3-cells and should therefore be treated by the administration of insulin.
7864,胰岛素依赖型糖尿病(insulin -dependent diabetes mellitus，HDDM)现在称为i型糖尿病。,Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is now called type I diabetes.
7864,p-细胞的完全衰竭要经过数年的时间。,"Total exhaustion of the (3-cells, however, may take several years."
7865,手术会切除掉部分阻碍气管的组织，帮助患者提高呼吸质量，治愈睡眠呼吸暂停综合征。另外有助瘦身的手术（即缩小胃部手术）也很有效，它可以治愈严重的睡眠呼吸暂停综合征。,"Surgery removes some of the obstructing tissue, which helps you breathe better and cure the apnea, and procedures that help you lose weight (that is, gastric bypass surgery) are also effective and can help some people who have severe sleep apnea."
7865,不过，你自己就可以给呼吸状况带来最大程度的改善。,But the biggest change can come from you.
7865,体重只要减轻4.5公斤，呼吸暂停的频度就可以减少30%，而体重增加4.5公斤结果就正相反。由此可知，瘦身比手术还有效。,"Losing just ten pounds can decrease your episodes of sleep apnea by 30 percent, while gaining ten pounds does the reverse —making weight loss even more effective than surgery."
7866,特定的一些物质，如尼古丁，会释放多巴胺，那是一种引起愉悦感的化学物质，让人体想要更多的尼古丁。由此引发的习惯性行为会让多巴胺源源不断地注入人体系统中。,"Certain substances like nicotine release dopamine, the pleasure chemical, and your body craves more of it—which leads to a habitual behavior to keep pumping dopamine into your system."
7866,并非所有的成瘾现象都是由多巴胺引起的，但是这也在一定程度上说明，像碳水化合物之类的物质也可能具有成瘾性。,"Not all addictions are caused by dopamine, but it may give some insight into the theory that such things like carbohydrates can be addictive."
7867,"与成年人相比，极限运动时儿童的血乳酸和肌肉乳酸水平无法达到很高水平（Astrand, 1952; Eriksson et al.，1971; Eriksson, 1980)。","Children are not able to attain high blood and muscle lactate concentrations during maximal exercise, compared to adults (Astrand, 1952; Eriksson et al., 1971; Eriksson, 1980)."
7867,"但是，在生长过程中，最大的血乳酸水平随着年龄的增长而增高 (Astrand, 1952; Eriksson et al., 1971; Eriksson, 1980)。","However, maximal blood lactate concentration increases with age during growth (Astrand, 1952; Eriksson et al., 1971, 1973; Eriksson, 1980)."
7867,"在次极限运动时，儿童和青少年肌肉乳酸水平比成年人低（Astmnd, 1952; Bar-Or, 1983; Moritani et al., 1989)。","Muscle lactate concentration during submaximal exercise is also lower in children and adolescents, compared to adults (Astrand, 19 52; Bar-Or, 1983; Moritani et al., 1989)."
7867,上述研究表明，正在生长中的个体与成年人相比，无论在有氧运动还是在无氧运动中都较少依赖糖原酵解生成乳酸这一代谢途径来补充ATP。,These observations suggest that growing individuals rely less than adults on the glycogen to lactate metabolic pathway to replenish ATP during both aerobic and anaerobic exercise.
7868,在史前时期，当早期人类想增强并展示自己的身体能力时，他们会利用自己对身体的控制力。他们会将身体向上拉起、屈膝跳跃，还会借助手臂的力量把身体推离地面。,"Ever since prehistory, when the first men wished to develop and display their power they did so by demonstrating their control over their body; lifting the body up, bending the knees and jumping, and pressing the body away from the surface of the earth using the strength of the limbs."
7868,这些动作最终演化成了体操的基本动作。,These actions eventually evolved into what we would recognize today as the art of calisthenics.
7869,对食物中B12的吸收需要一种来自胃部的物质，称为体内自带物质。随着年龄的增长，这种物质的产量会减少。,"Absorption of Bl2 in food requires a substance from our stomachs called intrinsic factor, the production of which decreases with age."
7869,（美国医 学院推测70岁后，就没有人有体内带这种物质了。,(The American College of Physicians assumes that no one has intrinsic factor over age seventy.)
7869,）因此，我们要么可以通过注射让B12进入体内，要么以服用晶体药片的形式。（除非你身上的针孔比瘾君子还多，再多扎些也无所谓，否则我们还是建议你优先考虑服药。）,"So you can either get Bl2 into your body through a shot or a crystalline pill form (unless you have more body piercings than a punk rocker, we assume you'd prefer the crystalline pill)."
7870,体温调节功能（thermoregulation)可以受到各种环境条件、身体和生理状态的影响。,"Thermoregulation may be affected by the environmental conditions, and the physical and physiological state of the body."
7870,影响体温调节功能的环境条件有周围环境的温度、空气湿度和风速。,"The environmental conditions that affect thermoregulation are ambient temperature, air humidity and wind velocity."
7870,影响体温调节功能的身体因素包括体格的大小，身体成分以及身体表面面积与体重的比例。,"Physical factors affecting thermoregulation include body size, composition and body surface area to mass ratio."
7871,本章概要介绍儿童与成人之间在体温调节方面的差异，并且尽可能介绍青少年时期在酷热和寒冷中运动的生理反应的变化情况。,This chapter outlines the differences in thermoregulation between children and adults and the possible changes which occur during adolescence in the physiological response to exercise in the heat and in the cold.
7871,为了帮助早期诊断，我们将介绍各种热和冷环境引起的疾病的早期体征和症状。,The early signs and symptoms of various heat and cold disorders are described to facilitate their early  identification.
7871,最后，讨论体温过高 (hyperthermia)和体温过低（hypothermia) 对身体的损害及其预防措施。,"Finally, the adverse effects of hyperthermia and hypothermia and their prevention are discussed."
7872,这就是说，孩子们随着长大而变得更加强壮，这主要是因为肌肉体积增大；有氧耐力和运动节省化（exercise economy)的提髙主要是由于腿长和步频的增加。,"That is, children become stronger as they grow, mainly because of muscle enlargement.Improvements in aerobic endurance fitness and exercise economy happen mainly due to increases in leg length and stride frequency."
7872,与年龄相关的VO2max的增加，则与更大的心室可以产生更大的心输出量有关。,Age-related increases in VO2max parallel the larger stroke volumes of bigger heart ventricles.
7872,此外，在这个年龄组中，运动表现和体质随着时间的提髙，通常反映了激素的活动，这些激素的作用是促进身体生长。,"In this age group, then, increases in performance and markers of physiological fitness over time generally reflect the action of hormonal agents that are responsible for promoting body growth."
7873,最好，以重量表示的体重应该采用经过正确校正的杠杆式体重计来称重并记录到0.1kg的精度。,"Ideally, body mass expressed in units of weight should be obtained on an accurately calibrated beam-type balance and recorded to the nearest 0.1 kg."
7873,受试者必须裸体称重或者穿着已知重量的服装（这样可以计算出裸体的重量)。,The subject should be weighed nude or in clothing of known weight so a correction to nude weight can be made.
7873,在早晨常规测定的称重值是监测体重变化最稳定的数值，这时的体重是经过12小时消化和排泄后的体重。,"The most stable values for monitoring weight change are those obtained routinely in the morning, 12 h after having ingested food, and after voiding."
7873,可是，这种严格的控制对于监测生长通常是没有必要的。,"However, such exact control is not generally necessary for growth records."
7873,在大多数情况下，校正过的弹簧称测量到0.5kg的精度已能满足要求。,"For most purposes, a calibrated spring scale with measurement made to the nearest 0.5 kg is satisfactory."
7874,"虽然在技术上体重指数（body mass index, BMI)不能归类为身体成分测量，但是它在临床和流行病学方面在成年人中得到了广泛的应用。","While BMI cannot be technically classified as a body composition measurement, it has received widespread use with adults in clinical and epidemiological assessments."
7874,体重指数只需要测量身髙和体重。,BMI only requires measurement of height and body weight.
7874,它的定义就是体重/身髙的平方，以kg / m2表示。,It is defined as body weight/height2 and expressed as kg/m2.
7875,体重计。,Weighing machine.
7875,传统上体重计是平衡杠式的，以1kg和1/10kg为单位。,"Classically, the weighing machine was a balance beam scale calibrated in kilograms and tenths of kilograms."
7875,全世界有各种各样品名的体重计。,These are to be found under different brand names throughout the world.
7875,其中最好的是可以校准的体重计。,The best of them provide for calibration adjustments.
7875,近年来，已经被数字体重计所取代。,"In recent years, these have given way to digital scales."
7875,大多数是弹簧式体重计并转换成电子数字读数。,Most of these are converted spring-type scales with electronics to convert a digital read out.
7875,他们不比浴室用的体重计精确。,They are no more accurate than an ordinary bathroom scale.
7876,毫无疑问，古人使用了许多不同体系的体操来锻炼身体。,There were doubtless many different systems of calisthenics training used by the ancients.
7876,不过，从留存至今的文字与图 像中我们所能了解的是，那些极富传奇色彩的战士和运动员使用的自身体重训练法与今天广 为人们熟知的“体操”几乎没有一点儿相似之处—远不是一种软绵绵的有氧训练。,What we do know from the surviving descriptions and images was that the bodyweight training performed by these legendary warriors and athletes bore little resemblance to what is known as “calisthenics” today.
7876,而更像是 力量训练·事实上，他们的锻炼方法的确更适用于增强力量和爆发力。,"Rather than being a relatively soft form of aerobic training, their systems would have looked more like gymnastics, and would definitely have been geared more solidly to the progressive development or power and strength."
7877,尽管吸烟的危害远远超过这种体重增加的危险，在戒烟期间，我们还是能防止体重增加的。,"Though the dangers of smoking far outweigh the dangers of this additional weight, you can prevent weight gain during the quitting process."
7877,散步就能起到这样的作用。,Walking will help.
7877,无糖口香糖也会舒缓口腔对食物的渴望。,Chewing sugarless gum will ease oral cravings.
7877,在手腕上缠一圈橡皮筋，这样你的手指就有事可做了，而不会习惯性地想夹起一根香烟。,Put a rubber band around your wrist so you have something to do with your fingers besides pick up baby back ribs.
7877,饮食主要是低脂肪的，比如水果、蔬菜和不含黄油的爆米花，还可以吃一些含有少量健康脂肪的小吃，比如水果核桃拼盘。,"Concentrate on low-fat snacks, like fruits, vegetables, and unbuttered popcorn, with a few healthy-fat snacks like six walnuts with the fruit."
7878,"布里尔等（Brill et al., 1989)研究了 参加高中或大学竞技运动队的345名25~ 60岁的男子。",Brill et al. (1989) studied 345 men aged 25—60 years who had participated in competitive sports teams in high school or college.
7878,当与75名非运动员对照组比较时，原运动员在成年期的经常体力活动的水平是没有差别的。,Level of regular physical activity during adult years was not different in the former athletes when compared to 75 non-athlete control subjects.
7878,两组之间的大多数冠心病的危险因素（体重指数，血清脂质状况和血压）类似的。,"Most coronary risk factors (body mass index, serum lipid profile and blood pressure) were similar in the two groups."
7878,原运动员的吸烟者较多（22%)，但是跑台耐力运动的时间长于非运动员。,"Prevalence of smoking was greater in the ex-athletes (22%), who had longer treadmill endurance times than the non-athletes."
7879,3次跳跃的最大值或平均值作为试验的得分。,The best or the average value of three jumps is generally taken as the test score.
7879,"纵跳被认为是腿部功率的有效指标。从萨金特试验演化出各种各样的纵跳方案，如跳起-手触墙试验，阿巴拉科夫试验（Abalakow test;见Kirby, 1991的综述）。","The vertical jump has been accepted as a valid measure of leg power and various vertical jump protocols have been derived from the Sargent test (e.g.jump-and-reach test, the Abalakow test) (for review see Kirby, 1991)."
7880,打造自己的家庭健身房只需要一个壶铃、一副跳绳和一个安装引体向上单杠的地方。,"You can start building your home gym with just a kettlebell, a jump rope, and a place to install a pull-up bar."
7880,这些器械只能满足进行身体自重的CFE训练。,This will suffice for the many CFE workouts that use body weight only.
7880,"然而某些时候,你也希望做一些自由力量的练习。","At some point, however, you will want free weights."
7880,"虽然你可以在健身中心或者商业健身房进行CrossFit训练,但是这些地方普遍没有高弹片(奥林匹克举重的必需品——进行更大重量的举重时,扔扛铃是很普遍的动作)。","Although it is possible to do CrossFit workouts at fitness centers and commercial gyms, they generally don’t have bumper plates (a necessity with Olympic lifts—dropping the barbells is routine when youpursue heavier lifts)."
7881,20世纪30年代，乔在圣路易斯与“铁臂阿童木”（The Mighty Atom）共同锻炼。,"In St. Louis in the 1930s, Joe worked out with The Mighty Atom, one of the most famous strongmen of all time."
7881,“铁臂阿童木”是有史以来最著名的大力士之一，身高只有163厘米，体重约64千克。,Standing at just 5’4” and weighing 140 lbs.
7881,“铁臂阿童木”是一个奇迹，他的日常表演会令众多的现代健美者哭着去找妈妈。,", The Atom was a phenomenon.He performed feats on a daily basis that would make modern bodybuilders cry for their mommies."
7881,他能挣脱铁索、徒手把大钉子钉进松木板里，还能把小钉子咬成两半。,"He broke out of chains, drove spikes into pine planks with his palms, and bit penny nails clean in half."
7882,声波进入耳朵，振动鼓膜和三个相连的小骨。,The sound waves entering the ear vibrate both the eardrum and three attached small bones.
7882,最后一根小骨将过滤后的声波传至耳蜗管。听觉神经会在此将信息转化成电流脉冲传达到大脑。,"The last bone passes a filtered sound wave into the cochlear duct, where hair cells and your acoustic nerve convert the information to electrical impulses for the brain."
7882,内耳的半规管有回转仪的作用，使我们保持平衡。,The semicircular conals work like a gyroscope to keep us balanced.
7883,"对于很少接触力量和体能训练的传统跑者,他们很难想象将过顶深蹲、跳箱和挺举融入到自己的训练中。","For the traditional runner who has had minimal exposure to strength and conditioning work, it may be hard to imagine adding exercises such as overhead squats, box jumps, and clean and jerks to your workout regimen."
7883,这些器材或训练思路对他们来说似乎是颠覆性的。,Maybe the equipment or logistics seems overwhelming.
7883,但事实并不是这样。,Not the case.
7883,"结合CrossFit训练— 不 论是在CrossFit健身房或在自己家,比你想象的更容易。",Adding CrossFit workouts to your program—whether in a CrossFit gym or in your own home—is easier than you think.
7884,同时效度(concurrent validity)是指在相近的时间内，执行的测量结果与效标结果之相关的一种效标效度(同时)。,"Concurrent validity is a type of criterion validity that involves correlating an instrument with some criterion that is administered at about the same time (i.e., concurrently)."
7884,许多动作表现测量的分数都用此方法来佐证效度。,The scores from many physical performance measures are validated in this manner.
7884,常用的效标包括已经被证实有效度或广为接受的测量方式，例如评分者评量与实验室技术。,"Popular criterion measures include already validated or accepted measures, such as judges’ ratings and laboratory techniques."
7884,同时效度也经常用于研究者想以较为简短或较易操作的测验，来替代某个操作困难的效标。,"Concurrent validity is usually employed when the researcher wishes to substitute a shorter, more easily administered test for a criterion that is difficult to measure."
7885,近几年，多方试图解决关于文献回顾的问题已被提出。,"In recent years, several attempts have been made to solve the problems associated with literature reviews."
7885,最值得注意的是Glass ( 19 7 6 )文章里所做的诸多尝试，以及后续Glass、McGaw、与Smith ( 1981 ) 书中所提及称作统合分析( meta-analysis) 的一个技巧。,"The most notable of these attempts was made in a paper by Glass (1976) and followed up with abookby Glass, McGaw, and Smith (1981), in which they proposed a technique called meta-analysis."
7885,"这个章节主要的目的即是用以呈现统合分析概要，以及已建立用来使用在统合分析的程序步骤（对于一般性研究整合的做法，请参见Cooper & Hedges, 1994) 。","The major purpose of this chapter is to present an overview of meta-analysis and the procedures developed for use in meta-analysis (for a more general approach to research synthesis, see Cooper & Hedges, 1994)."
7886,癌细胞是由于基因细微的突变而引起的。这些基因忙着复制细胞以应付一天的活动。,Cancer is all about subtle mutations in your genes that are busy reproducing cells for the day s activities.
7886,这种神奇的机器在你需要更多的细胞的时候，会像加速器一样运转，当你需要慢下来时又能像抑制器一样发挥作用。它偶犯会丢失一段基因。,"This spectacular machinery, complete with accelerators for when you need more cells and inhibitors for when you need to slow down, occasionally loses a piece of a gene."
7886,这些基因大多数是不重要的，而且没人会注意到。,Most are unimportant and no one notices.
7886,接着你正常细胞中的物质就会产生一种免疫系统无法识别并且无法对其做出反应的基因突变。,Then something in your normally functioning cell creates a genetic mutation that your immune system doesn't recognize and isn't able to react to.
7887,孩童时，我看到迪克·布特库斯（Dick·Butkus）在接受采访时说，高中时推一辆两吨重的汽车帮他练就了橄榄球比赛中不可思议的爆发力。从那时起，我就开始向往推汽车。,"When I was a kid I saw a Dick Butkus interview where he talked about developing his awesome power for football by pushing a two-ton vehicle around when he was in high school.As a result, I became  obsessed with the idea of pushing cars."
7887,这听起来好像是只有超人才能完成的事情。,It seemed like something only Superman could do.
7887,只要有机会，我就会将妈妈那辆破旧的福特翼虎沿街推上一小段。,"Whenever I got the chance, I would push my mom’s scratched up Ford Maverick a short way along the block."
7887,我儿时的胳膊长得像意大利细面条，那时虽然只能把车往前推几米，但我感到很满足！,"My arms were like spaghetti when I was a kid and it took forever to get a few yards, but man was it a satisfying feeling!"
7887,虽然在狱中不怎么看芝加哥熊队的比赛，但我一出狱就立刻恢复了推汽车的爱好。,"I don’t follow the Chicago Bears much any more, but as soon as I got out of prison I quickly rediscovered my love of car pushing."
7887,我会找一段空旷的马路或小道，关掉汽车引擎、挂上空挡——如果不挂空挡推起来会有点儿困难。,"Find a clear stretch of road or track, turn off your engine and stick your whip into neutral (you might experience a little trouble if you keep it in gear)."
7887,然后走到车后，将手掌撑在后备箱上——不要推后挡风玻璃。,Get round the back of your car and put your palms on the metal of the trunk—you don’t want to be putting a load of force through a glass rear windshield just in case.
7887,双臂几乎伸直，上身前倾，靠双腿发力推动汽车。,Keep your arms nearly straight and lean into the movement as much as you can.Push away with your legs.
7887,虽然汽车动起来之后推起来会容易一点儿，但也不会好太多。,"Once you get over the vehicle’s inertia, pushing gets a little easier.But not much."
7888,确切地说，这些类别是根据对个人是否参加运动的现状进行研究与评估后得出的。,"Typically, these classifications were made after the fact and assessed the individual's current status of sport involvement or non-involvement."
7888,这些描述意味着，少年儿童要么参与运动要么退出运动，不存在第三种情况。,These definitions infer an all-or-nothing meaning to sport participation or withdrawal.
7888,这些用语没有反映少年儿童退出运动这一复杂的过程。,What these terms fail to capture is the rather complex process that contributes to the child's withdrawal from sport.
7888,研究人员用这些更为传统的用语就不能确认一些情况的“是”与“否”，比如说：个体对另外一项运动感兴趣还是对运动以外的活动有兴趣。,"Researchers utilizing these more traditional definitions cannot evaluate, for example, whether or not: The individual develops an interest in another sport or an activity outside of sport."
7889,这样一来，小肌群的工作量便会转移到它们所属的大肌群上，如腓肠肌和髋部屈肌的工作量便转移到了臀大肌和腘绳肌上。,"This shifts the workload away from smaller muscles such as the calves and hip flexors to large muscles such as the glutes and hamstrings, where it belongs."
7889,为了培养正确的CFE跑步技巧，麦肯齐训练的运动员需要掌握如下技能。训练快速的步频。,"To develop proper CFE running technique, MacKenzie’s athletes work on mastering the following skills.Develop a rapid cadence."
7889,理想的跑步步频比你习惯的步频要快很多，通常要求每分钟180次。,Ideal running requires a cadence that may be much quicker than you’re used to.Shoot for 180 footfalls per minute.
7890,气味似乎是吸引异性的主导性因素之一，这个结论也许会令世界各地的时尚产品制造者和发型师大失所望。,"Perhaps to the disappointment of fashion manufacturers and hairstylists everywhere, smell seems to be one of the dominant factors in attracting partners."
7890,成人会释放称为外激素的化学物质，它能够分泌吸引异性的气味。,Adult species release chemical compounds called pheromones that secrete smells that make us attractive to others.
7890,这是一种化学反应，而不是大脑反应，正因为此，有些人会觉得你很有吸引力，而另外一些人则会对你很排斥，而喜爱和讨厌又都没有理由。,"It s a chemical reaction more than a cerebral one, which is why wc'rc attracted to some people and repelled by others without really knowing why."
7891,动脉血管最外层是外膜，很像香肠的肠衣。它在外围固定着动脉血管的整体结构，像玻璃纸的外包装一样。,"The outer layer is the adventitia, and it's like a sausage casing; it holds your artery together from the outside, within a kind of cellophane wrap."
7891,当然，有些情况会让系统运作失常。,"Several things, of course, can throw the works off schedule, and you can see how the process functions in Figure 2."
7891,图2.1描绘了动脉血管的具体工作过程。,1.
7892,腰围。,Waist girth.
7892,在腰部明显狭小的水平上的围度，大约位于肋骨下缘与髋嵴上缘之间距离的一半处。,Perimeter at the level of the notice­ able waist narrowing located approximately half way between the costal border and iliac crest.
7892,对腰部不明显的受试者，腰围是在两侧肋骨下缘的水平上进行测量。,"In subjects where the waist is not ap­ parent, an arbitrary waist measurement is made at this level about the lateral level of the 10th rib."
7893,儿童时期体力活动的方式会影响到未来的疾病发生率。,Patterns of physical activity during childhood may affect the incidence and morbidity of disease later in life.
7893,"例如，弗里曼等(Freeman et al.,1990)近来研究了英国成年人冠状动脉疾病高发地区儿童的潜在危险因素。他们发现这些地区的儿童普遍缺乏体力活动。","For example, Freeman et al. (1990) recently studied potential risk factors among children who lived in neighbourhoods in the UK where adults had a high incidence of coronary artery disease.Lack of physical activity was more predominate in children living in the high-risk neighbourhoods."
7894,正如莱曼斯克等人和米德尔顿所指出的，哮喘患者呼吸道的病理过程是具有钙依赖性的：“在平滑肌中兴奋-收缩的耦合，在肥大细胞和黏液腺中刺激-分泌的耦合……和炎性细胞的移动和激活（都有钙的参与）。,"As Lemanske and Middleton point out, the pathological processes in the airways of patients with asthma are calcium-dependent: 'excitation—contraction coupling in smooth muscle, stimulus—secretion coupling in mast cells and mucous glands . . . and the movement and activation of inflammatory cells'."
7894,”钙通道阻滞剂尼索地平和维拉帕米对阻断运动性哮喘都有效，而地尔硫卓却无效。,"The calcium channel blockers nifedipine and verapamil have been shown to be effective in blocking EIA, while diltiazem has not."
7894,图29.15和表29.2显示一些治疗运动性哮喘常用药物疗效的比较。,Fig. 29.15 and Table 29.2 show the comparative effects of some of the drags most commonly used for EIA.
7895,这些类似维生素的物质（它们功效类似维生素，但是并非生命的必需品），已经显示出有减缓动脉和免疫力老化的功用。,These vitamin-like substances (they work like vitamins but aren't essential for life) have been shown to decrease the rate of arterial and immune aging.
7895,它们似乎能使你的记忆库更久更深刻地保持对过去敌人的记忆。,They seem to allow your memory bank to maintain the memory of old foes longer and more intensely.
7895,如果你的食谱里含类黄酮——大约一天31毫克的量，就可以对你的生理年龄起到重要影响。,If you eat a diet rich in flavonoids——about 31 milligrams of them a day——you'll have a significant effect on your Real Age.
7896,钾能促进动脉健康（最好从食物中摄取，每日四种水果，特别是香蕉、鳄梨和瓜类）。每天补充维生素A不应超过2500国际单位（不少于）1500国际单位）。,"Potassium promotes arterial health (get it from dietary sources: four fruis per day, especially bananas, avocados, and melon.) And avoid more than 2,500 IU of vitamin A a day (minimum is 1,500IU)."
7896,每天分两次正确补充多种维生素，会让你的生理年龄小6岁以上。,The correct multivitamin taken twice a day can make your Real Age more than six years younger.
7897,许多水果和蔬菜中含有维生素C和生物类黄酮。有证据证明丰富的食谱内只需每天含有四份水果，就会使你的生理年龄年轻4岁之多。,"Many fruits and vegetables contain C and bioflavonoids, and there's evidence that eating a diverse diet that includes just four sevings of fruit a day can make your RealAge as much as four years younger."
7897,一个最近的研究表明对于超过50岁的人来说，一天内至少吃三份水果的人比那些只吃一份半的人更能避免患视网膜中心退化。,"Specifically, a recent study showed that people over age fifty who ate at least three servings of fruit a day were less likely to develop macular degeneration than those who ate one and a half servings."
7898,在某些方面，获得阳光是非常重要的。,"In some ways, getting sun is very important."
7898,每天晒10-20分钟的阳光能够帮助你把某种形式非活性的维生素D转化成一种维生素原，这种物质能变成活性的维生素D，这对于你的心血管和免疫系统都有很大的好处。,Getting ten to twenty minutes of sun exposure every day helps you convert some forms of inacitve vitamin D into a precursor that becomes active vitamin D—which has a huge beneficial effect on your cardiovascular and immune systems.
7898,那会使你拥有年轻一岁多的生理年龄的效果。,
7898,,And that has a RealAge effect of making you more than two years younger.
7899,维生素D3的来源有三种：日光、食物和维生素补品。,"You can get vitamin D3 from three sources: the sun, food, and vitamin supple-ments."
7899,日照实际上是引发了一种化学反应，可以让原先不活跃的维生素D3具有活性。但是大多数人接受日照的吋间都不足以获得适量的维生素D3(而待在阳光下时间过长，则会增加得皮肤癌的危险；防晒霜也会阻碍不活跃维生素D3转化为活性维生素）。,"The sun actually triggers a chemical reaction that turns inactive vitamin into active vitamin D3, but most people aren't exposed to enough sun to get the recommended amount of (and prolonged exposure can increase your risk of skin cancer; sunblock also blocks the vitamin conversion)."
7900,胃是人体的食物储藏室，食物滑下食道，就留在胃里。,"It's your stomach-- the storage bin of food.Once your food drops down your esophagus, it lingers there."
7900,食物待在胃里的时间越长，我们就越觉得饱，不想进食。,"The longer it stays, the fuller you feel and the less you eat."
7900,由于堆积着食物，胃里能发生许多事情。,A lot of things happen in your stomach because of the accumulation of all that food.
7900,你胃部有发热的感觉，可能会猜想是轻度的胃食道反流或胃灼热。,"When you feel that burning sensation in your gut, you assume it's a mild case of GERD or heartburn."
7901,看看马吧，马不会呕吐，所以当它们吃了有毒的东西后，就无法将毒物排出体外。,"Horses, for instance, can't vomit, so when they eat poisonous stuff, they can't get it out of their system."
7901,这就带来了绞痛，或者说是由消化道受损引起的剧烈腹痛。绞痛是马死亡的主要原因。,That promotes a condition called colic—or severe abdominal pain caused by trauma in the digestive tract—and that's the leading cause of equine deaths.
7901,因此，我们应该庆幸人类能够呕吐、吐痰，还会嗝气。,"So the stars of MTV's Jackass aren't the only ones who should be thankful humans can vomit, spit up, and vent air with Richter-registering burps."
7901,这种排毒控制系统让我们能将有害物质排出，但它也会造成胃酸逆流。,"This poison-control system helps us clear harmful sub-stances out of our bodies, but it also contributes to acid reflux."
7902,一个广泛使用的无氧功率指标是最大功率输出。最大功率输出是采用温盖特无氧试验进行测试的，是受试者在30秒钟内全力蹬车时第一个或第二个2.5-5秒内产生的最大无氧功率。,A widely used measure of anaerobic power is provided by the peak power (PP) output generated during the first or second 2.5-5s interval of the all-out 30s cycle ride of the Wingate anaerobic test (WAnT).
7902,在5秒钟内的这种运动主要取决于以肌酸激酶为限速酶的三磷酸腺苷-磷酸肌酸系统；或者取决于肌肉内能源系统快速补充ATP的能力。,"Performance during such a task (5s), depends predominantly on the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-creatine phosphate system, with creatine kinase being the rate-limiting enzyme, or the capacity to replenish ATP by means of the immediately available muscle sources of energy."
7903,卧推被吹捧为顶级的上身练习动作，其实这是错误的。,"The bench press is often touted as a superior upper body exercise, but this is a fallacy."
7903,因为卧推不仅人为地将上身孤立，还会（即便是进行短期练习）损伤肩袖，对肘关节和腕关节也有不利影响。,"Not only does bench pressing isolate the upper body in an artificial way, it also destroys the rotator cuff muscles as well as irritating the elbow and wrist joints when performed over even short periods."
7903,俯卧撑不但会保护这些关节，还能发展出能用的力量——在现实世界中（而不仅仅在健身房中）真正有用的力量。,"The pushup protects the joints and builds functional strength, real-world strength—not just the kind of strength that can be used in a gym."
7903,这就是为什么俯卧撑在全世界的巅和军事训练营都是肌肉训练的首选——自从历史上第一位战士开始力量训练时，它就一直如此。,"This is why the pushup is the number one muscle-building exercise in military training camps and academies the world over.It always has been, since the first warriors trained for strength."
7904,做乌鸦式时，双膝分开，呈蹲坐姿势。,"In the crow stand, sit down on your haunches with your knees apart."
7904,双手手掌放在身体前面的地板上，与肩同宽。,"Place your palms on the floor in front of you, at approximately shoulder width distance apart."
7904,双臂略微弯曲，身体向前倾斜，然后让双膝稳稳地夹在两肘外侧（图109）。,"Your arms should be bent a little.Lean forwards, placing your knees securely on the outside of your elbows (fig. 109)."
7905,但是，必须认识到月经周期长短的变化不会引起闭经。,"However, it must be recognized that alterations in cycle length may occur that do not produce amenorrhoea."
7905,例如，当只收集月经的数据时，就容易遗漏掉短黄体期、黄体期不足（luteal phase insufficiency)和无排卵期的数据。,"For example, three aberrations —the short luteal phase, luteal phase insufficiency and anovulation — can easily be missed when only menstrual data are obtained."
7905,在月经初潮后早期，无排卵（anovulation)的月经周期的发生率（5%-7% )最高 (Vollman，1977)。,"The highest incidence (5—7%) of anovulatory cycles is found in the early postmenarcheal years (Vollman, 1977)."
7906,30s全力的Wingate自行车运动测试可以提供最大功率和无氧功率信息。,Performance on a 30-second all-out Wingate cycling test provides information regarding peak and mean anaerobic power.
7906,这些变量证实了这样的生物节律，即下午3: 00-9: 00最大功率达到峰值，振幅为8%。,"These variables demonstrate circadian rhythmicity, with highest values between 3:00 and 9:00 p.m.and an amplitude of 8%."
7906,在台阶试验和楼梯跑跳测试中也发现了相似的昼夜节律。,Similar diurnal periodicity has been observed with bench exercises as well as with stair-running and jumping tests.
7907,有些情况就不一定是这样了。,Others have not been so sure.
7907,例如，物理运动规律不会因物体的运动方向相左而改变。,"Physical laws of motion, for example, work just as well in reverse as they do in forward motion."
7907,也就是说，如果你按照牛顿力学原理记录一个运动系统的影像，放映时你根本不会知道哪个片段在前或在后。,"That is, if you filmed a system corresponding to the laws of Newtonian mechanics, you would never be able to tell whether the film was later being projected backward or forward."
7907,同理，你不仅可能计算出太阳系周围行星未来的位置，还可能计算出它们过去的位置。,"It is possible to calculate not only the future positions of the planets around the solar system, but also their locations in the past."
7907,总之，物理学原理观照下的物理过程不存在时间向度上的方向性。,"In the laws of physics, there is no preferred direction of physical processes in respect to time."
7908,粪便带血可能会说明多种情况，但重要的是注意观察异常情况。通过结肠镜检查在有癌变前兆的息肉转变为结肠癌前，我们就能发现异常。（我们建议50岁以上的人，或是有结肠癌家族病史的40岁以上的人，每3年检查一次。）,"If you do have a positive reading-blood can be a sign of many things, but it's important to look for it so that a colonoscopy recommended every ten years for people over fifty or every five years for people over forty who have a family history of early onset colon cancer—can catch the precancerous polyps before they lead to colon cancer."
7909,硒是我们身体所需的微量矿物质元素之一。它大部分来自食物，比如大蒜。大蒜是通过从土中吸收硒（有许多鱼类，如鳕鱼、青鱼、鲭鱼、沙丁鱼和巴西坚果中也含有硒）。,"One of the trace minerals needed by our bodies, selenium largely comes from foods like garlic that absorb selenium from the soil.(Many fish, such as cod, herring, mackerel, and sardines, and Brazil nuts also have it.)"
7909,有项研究显示，那些每天两次每次服用100微克硒的人，癌症死亡率会减少50%。,One study showed a 50 percent reduction in cancer deaths among individuals who took 100 micrograms of selenium twice a day.
7910,蜥蜴俯卧撑包括四个难度水平。,There are four levels of difficulty to the gecko pushup.
7910,最简单的是训练者在做标准俯卧撑的基础上，将脚踝相扣，这样就只有一只脚与地面接触，这个动作有时也被称为三点俯卧撑。,"In the easiest version the athlete does full pushups, but with one ankle hooked over the other so that only one foot is making contact with the floor.These are sometimes called three-point pushups."
7910,第二个难度动作是训练者在做俯卧撑时，要始终抬起一只脚并伸直。,"In the second version, the athlete raises one leg off the floor, but keeps it locked straight out behind him as he does his pushups."
7910,这个细微的差别使这个动作对稳定肌（包括腿部、髋部、腰部和脊椎肌肉）提出了双倍的要求。,"This nuance doubles the isometric involvement of the movement’s stabilizers; the legs, hips, waist and spinal muscles."
7910,与标准俯卧撑相比，这个动作需要更强的平衡能力与精神集中力。,It also requires greater balance and focus than the normal pushup.
7910,第三个难度动作是训练者的两腿都蹬地，但一只手臂要伸向前方，与头部等高。,"In the third version the athlete keeps both legs on the floor, but stretches one arm out straight in front of him, level with his head."
7910,这个动作本质上是单臂俯卧撑，区别只是有一只手臂指向前，而不是固定在身后。,"This is essentially a one-arm pushup, but with one limb pointing forward instead of being secured next to the lower back."
7910,最难的是蜥蜴俯卧撑，训练者要把第二个与第三个难度动作结合起来——向前伸出一只手臂，同时另一侧的腿也要向后伸出。,"In the fourth and hardest version of the gecko pushup, the athlete combines the second and third versions.He lifts one arm out straight in front, as well as stretching the opposite leg out behind him as he performs the movement."
7910,用这种方式做俯卧撑时，为了保持身体稳定，上肢需要承受极大的力量，同时下背部也要如钢铁般结实。,Doing pushups in this manner requires significant upper body strength and a lower back of steel in order to remain stable.
7910,训练者就像一只蜥蜴在炽热的沙漠地面上交替抬脚，因此我将此动作命名为“蜥蜴俯卧撑”。,"In this position, the athlete resembles a lizard lifting alternate feet from the baking desert floor, hence the name “gecko” pushups."
7910,如果你已经具有了相当的力量，就可以将蜥蜴俯卧撑作为有趣的收尾练习。,Gecko pushups are a fun finishing exercise to include in your routine when you have the strength.
7910,为了保持对称发展，要确保两侧的练习次数相等。,Be sure to do an equal number of reps on either side to keep development symmetrical.
7911,蜥蜴桥是比标准桥难度更大的变式。,The gecko bridge is a slightly harder variation on the full bridge.
7911,先做出标准桥式（见图90），然后抬起一侧的手臂及另一侧的腿，使它们与地面平行，并分别朝向正前方和正后方。,"Simply get into the full bridge hold (fig.90), and lift one hand and the opposite foot from the floor, pointing these limbs out horizontally."
7911,坚持该姿势片刻，然后用四肢支撑身体，再换用另一只手臂及其相对的腿练习。,"Hold the position briefly, before supporting yourself with all your limbs again, and alternating the position with the other hand and foot."
7911,与标准桥相比，该动作需要四肢更有力量，同时也会强化腰部肌肉，因为它们必须极度紧张以维持身体平衡。,"This requires more limb strength than regular bridge holds, and also firms up the lumbar muscles which have to tense very strongly to maintain balance."
7912,双脚并拢，双膝着地。,"Kneel on the floor with your feet together, and your palms flat on the ground in front of you."
7912,双臂伸直，与肩同宽。双手在胸部的正下方，两个手掌平放在地面上。,"The arms should be straight, shoulder width apart, and in line with your chest."
7912,脚踝搭在一起，大腿与上身及头部成一条直线，不要撅屁股或者塌腰。,"Link one ankle around the other, and keep the hips straight and in alignment with the trunk and head."
7912,这是膝盖俯卧撑的起始姿势（图5）。,This is the start position of the kneeling pushup (fig. 5).
7913,体内的入侵者被巨噬细胞吞下并处理掉，巨噬细胞送出的化学信息（细胞活类素）吸引着别的白血球。,An invader into the body is ingested and processed by macrophages that send chemical messages (cytokines) that attract other white blood cells.
7913,（这种细胞分裂素有的时候会引起发烧、头疼和肌肉疼。,"(The cytokines can sometimes also cause fever, headache; and muscle pain.)"
7913,）做出反应的白细胞紧贴着巨噬细胞以获取更多关于入侵细菌的信息，并生成一种特殊的防御机制——把T细胞和B细胞召集到被感染区。,Responding white cells attach to the macrophage so they can learn more about the invaders and develop specialized defense mechanisms—in the form of calling T cells and B cells to the area.
7914,心脏就像人体房屋的总水管，提供人生存所需的营养成分。,"Your heart, which is a lot like the water main of your anatomical house, provides the nutrients you need to live."
7914,在“房屋”中，洁净的水能让你安全地饮用，还能冲走细菌。,"In your house, clean water lets you drink safely and wash away germs."
7914,在人体内，心脏将血液抽送到身体的各个“房间”一一送到大脑，让你可以思考；送到生殖器官，让你可以繁衍后代；送到消化系统，让你可以处理食物；送到肌肉，让你可以帮助邻居搬钢琴。,"In your body, your heart pumps blood to every room in your body—to your brain so you can think, to your sex organs so you can procreate, to your digestive system so you can process food, to your muscles so you can help your neighbors move their piano."
7915,很多入了狱又想维持手臂围度的健美者都会练习下沉臂屈伸。,Incline tiger bends are performed by a lot of bodybuilders who find themselves in prison and want to maintain their arm size.
7915,尽管这是一个自身体重训练动作，但它比标准俯卧撑更像杠铃臂屈伸，因为该动作主要锻炼肱三头肌，而不锻炼胸肌或肩部。,"Although it’s a bodyweight exercise, it’s more like a barbell triceps extension than a true pushup, because it works the triceps but not the pectorals or shoulders."
7915,身体前倾45°，抓住你面前的固定物体。,"Lean forwards at a forty-five degree angle, grabbing a solid object in front of you."
7915,在监狱里，洗漱台正好适合；但如果你在家锻炼，可以选用厨房操作台或写字台，甚至可以把手掌撑在墙上（与胸等高的位置）做该动作。,"In prison, wash basins usually fit the bill, but if you are training at home you might want to use a kitchen counter or a work surface.You can even do the exercise with your palms flat on a wall, opposite your chest."
7915,双肘始终朝向地面，肘部弯曲，肩部锁定。,"Keeping the elbows pointing down, bend at the elbows but not at the shoulders."
7915,尽力向前移动躯干，或直到其接触上臂，然后把自己推回到起始姿势。,"Continue moving forwards as far as you can or until your upper arms meet your torso, then press yourself up."
7916,下斜俯卧撑有时被误称为上斜俯卧撑。,"Confusingly, decline pushups are sometimes wrongly called incline pushups."
7916,做下斜俯卧撑时，你需要抬高双脚——放在比双手高的平面上。,They simply involve doing your pushups with the feet raised onto any surface higher than the hands.
7916,在监狱里，许多家伙都会借助床铺来做这个动作，不过你可以使用更高的物体，如书桌或洗漱台。,"In prison a lot of guys use their bunk, but you can go higher with a desk or basin."
7916,有些人甚至会把双脚高高地蹬在墙上，但要保持这个姿势身体必须绷得特别紧。,"Some men even wedge their feet high against the wall, but it requires a lot of body tension to retain this position."
7916,双脚抬起时，双手就要承受更多的体重，这样难度便加大了。,Raising the feet makes the exercise harder by transferring a greater proportion of the bodyweight through the hands.
7916,另外，由于身体与地面的角度变大，该动作将会比标准俯卧撑更强烈地作用于胸部的上半部分和肩部。,"Because of the increased angle, this movement effects the shoulders and upper portions of the chest more intensely than the prone pushup."
7916,我并不建议我的学生在下斜俯卧撑上花时间，因为倒立撑（见第十章）可以更集中地锻炼相应的肌肉。,"I don’t advise my students to spend time on the decline pushup, because handstand pushups (see chapter 10) convey all the benefits of decline pushups in a more concentrated way."
7916,如果你既做倒立撑，又做下斜俯卧撑，那就相当于双箭一雕（效率更低），而且还会有过度训练的危险。,"If you are doing handstand pushups, you are simply covering the same ground (but less efficiently) if you do decline pushups too.You are also risking overtraining."
7917,下斜仰卧起坐练习需要一块一端可以架高的板子或一个倾斜的平台。,Incline Sit-Ups require a board or platform you can elevate at one end.
7917,把双脚固定在板子或平台上较高的地方，然后开始做仰卧起坐。,Hook your feet under the straps and do your sit-ups.
7917,如果你觉得这样越来越轻松，那就逐渐抬高双脚，这会迫使身体中段在克服重力的过程中会更加用力。,"As they get easier, lift the end of the board under your feet by a few degrees.This forces the midsection to work harder against gravity."
7917,如果可以找到能够安全放置板子的更高的地方，那你可以持续抬高双脚，直到你的身体几乎与地面垂直。,"If you have something high enough to secure the board on, you can keep going until you are almost vertical."
7918,站在距墙壁大约一臂远的位置，如果把握不准，可以稍近一点儿，这样可以更安全地调整。,"Stand approximately one arm’s length from a wall.If in doubt about your positioning, it’s better to stand closer to the wall than further from it—you can more safely adjust your position this way."
7918,双脚与肩同宽，臀部向前挺，身体向后弯。,Your feet should be about shoulder width apart.Push the hips forwards and begin bending backwards.
7918,抬起下巴，头尽量向后仰，以舒服为准。,"Raise your chin, tilting your head back as far as is comfortable."
7918,身体继续平缓地向后弯，直到可以看到身后的墙壁。,Continue smoothly bending back until you can see the wall behind you.
7918,一旦能看见墙壁，便将双手举过头顶，手掌紧贴墙壁，手指朝下，与头部齐平。,"As soon as you can see the wall, raise your hands, moving them over your shoulders and placing the palms flat on the wall, fingers pointing down, level with your head."
7918,这是该动作的起始姿势（图95）。,This is the start position (fig. 95).
7918,将一部分体重向后转移到手上，把一只手降低几厘米，再让其紧贴墙壁；然后再移动另一只手，使其降得更低。,"Shift some of your bodyweight back through your hands, and lower one by a few inches, before placing it securely on the wall again.Now follow suit with your opposite hand, lowering it even further on the wall."
7918,用手在墙壁上向下“行走”时，身体要一直向后弯曲（图96）。,Keep bending backwards as you “walk” down the wall with your hands (fig. 96).
7918,手向下移动的同时，双脚也要一点点远离墙壁，以适应身体弯曲——只要感觉需要这样做就小步向前移动。,"As you move downwards, you will need to move slightly away from the wall to accommodate your body bend.Do this by taking mini-steps forwards any time you feel the need."
7918,双手继续交替下移，直到移至墙根为止。,Continue alternating this movement until you run out of wall.
7918,之后双手手掌撑地，此时你其实是在墙根处做标准的桥式。,"When this occurs, place your hands flat on the floor.At this stage you will be in a full bridge hold next to the wall."
7918,这是该动作的最低点（图97）。,This is the bottom position (fig. 97).
7918,然后让身体落到地板上，再站起来，回到起始姿势，重新开始下一轮动作。,"From here, simply lower your backside to the floor, and stand up.Return to the start position, and walk back down again."
7918,整个下行桥过程中要平缓呼吸。,Breathe regularly as you go the wall walking bridges (down).
7919,注重LSD的教练认为，LSD可以积极改变骨骼肌细胞：主要发生在“线粒体生物合成”过程中，这个过程是身体合成更多的线粒体进入每一个肌肉细胞的过程。,"Coaches who focus on LSD claim that LSD runs deliver positive changes in the skeletal muscle cells: This occurs chiefly as “mitochondrial biogenesis,” which is the process by which the body packs more mitochondria into each muscle cell."
7919,这一过程对跑者非常重要，因为线粒体（许多生物教科书称之为“细胞的发电站”）是燃料转化成能量的场所。,"This is important to runners because the mitochondria, nicknamed “the powerhouse of the cell”in innumerable biology textbooks, are where fuel is converted to energy."
7919,简单来讲，细胞里的线粒体越多，细胞工作产生的能量就越多。,"Simply put, the more mitochondria you have in a cell, the more energy that cell has available to produce work."
7920,素食者是很长时间不吃肉的一类人，他们再吃肉时会产生排斥。,Vegetarians who haven't eaten meat in a long time don't like it if they try it again.
7920,这是因为从他们的唾液腺到胃腺和小肠腺，都不再分泌与消化肉类相对应的一系列酶，人体无法顺利消化肉食。,That’s because they don't secrete the right mix of enzymes from the salivary glands to the stomach's digestive enzymes and small intestine to optimally digest meat.
7920,素食者吃肉时，身体就会发生一种反应：肉食感觉很重，无法正常消化，因此感觉不舒服，对肉产生排斥。,"That triggers a reaction when you do eat it: it feels heavy, you don't digest it as well, so you don't feel good and you don't enjoy it."
7921,不同暴露组别在疾病发生率的绝对风险差异，可透过简单的减法计算获得。,Differences in disease rates between exposure groups expressed on an absolute basis can be obtained by simple subtraction of rates.
7921,近来，暴露—疾病关系的估算更多是以相对风险( relative r is k )表示。,"More frequently, estimates of the exposure-disease relationship are expressed as the relative risk."
7921,相对风险可透过计算暴露因子各组别发生率对其参照组( referent category )发生率的率比( ratio )而得。,Relative risks are calculated as the ratio of the referent category to various exposure levels.
7922,藉由将成绩标记出来(图 6.1)，你会发现高个子大致来说确实跳得比矮个子远。,"By plotting the scores (figure 6.1), you can see that taller people generally do jump farther than shorter people."
7922,但是请注意，这样的关联性并不是完美的。,But note that the relationship is not perfect.
7922,如果是完美的关联，成绩应该会从图中的左下角开始，往斜对角方向出现一条笔直的线，直到右上端。,"If it were, the scores would begin in the lower left-hand comer of the figure and proceed diagonally in a straight line toward the upper right-hand corner."
7922,测量两个变项之间关联程度的一种方法是皮尔森积差相关系数(Pearson productmoment coefficient of correlation)(也称为 Pearson r、组间相关，或是简单相关)。,"One measure of the degree of association between two variables is called the Pearson product moment coefficient of correlation (also known as Pearson r, interclass correlation, or simple correlation)."
7923,项目分析的目的便是要确定哪些测验题目是合适的。哪些题目是需要修改或舍弃的。,The purpose of item analysis is to determine which test items are suitable and which need to be rewritten or discarded.
7923,项目分析的两个重要工作便是决定测验题目的难度以及对不同成就水准的鉴别能力。,Two important facets of item analysis are determining the difficulty of the test items and determining their power to discriminate among levels of achievement.
7924,"在古典测验理论中,项目难度是以全体回答的结果来测量。","In CTT, item difficulty is measured as a function of the total group."
7924,"而在试题反应理论中,项目难度是固定的,而且可以由对应的受试者能力水准来评量。","In IRT, item difficulty is fixed and can be assessed relative to an examinee’s ability level."
7924,"因此 ,特定能力的受试者能正确回答一个题目的机率,便可以数学的方式被描绘成一条试题特征曲线(item characteristic curve, Iconvict conditioning )。","Thus, the probability that an examinee with a particular ability level will make a correct response to an item can be mathematically described by an item characteristic curve (Iconvict conditioning)."
7924,"对个别题目而言,试题特徵曲线是一条由左向右渐增的非线性迴归曲线,表示答对的机率随著能力或是潜在特质的提高而增加。","The Iconvict conditioning is a nonlinear regression for any item that increases from left to right, indicating an increase in the probability of a correct response with increased ability, or latent trait."
7925,在海上，没有人不想要一个打足气的救生圈，同样，没有人不想拥有氧气充足的呼吸管道。,"No one wants to be at sea without a fully inflated life ring, and no one wants to live without fully inflated airways."
7925,以下介绍与衰老有关的主要健康问题，它们会损害我们赖以生存的呼吸系统，让管道漏气。,These are the important aging-related conditions that can deflate—or destroy the structures that help keep you alive.
7925,睡眠呼吸暂停综合征和哮喘是两种最常见的肺部问题，因此我们会在本章中详细分析这两种疾病。,"Sleep apnea and asthma are the most common lung abnormalities, so we discuss these two at length in this chapter."
7926,约翰•弗洛耶爵士于1689年完成一部哮喘专著。,Sir John Floyer wrote an entire book devoted to asthma in 1698.
7926,他的主要贡献是认识到支气管平滑肌的重要性：……在哮喘发作时，肺内支气管肌纤维收缩，多在呼气时产生哮鸣……。,"His major contribution may have been the recognition of the importance of bronchial smooth muscle: .. .in the Asthmatic fit, the Muscular Fibres of the Bronchi... of the Lungs are contracted and that produces the Wheezing Noise, which is most observable in the Expiration.. ."
7926,公元2世纪，阿拉图斯观察到运动和哮喘的关系：“当进行体操或其他运动时，出现的呼吸困难，称为哮喘”。,"The relationship between exercise and asthma was recognized at least as far back as the second century A.D., when Arateus the Cappadocian observed: 'If from gymnastics or other exercise the breathing become labored, it is called asthma'."
7927,消防员冲刺跑是冲刺跑的高强度训练法，需要训练伙伴。,Fireman Sprint is an intense method of sprinting that requires a training partner.
7927,在消防员冲刺跑中，弯腰并把肩膀抵在伙伴腰下，当他趴在你背上之后，站起来，顺势把他背离地面，他的头会在你的背上，双脚悬在你大腿的位置，用手钩住他的双腿以保持稳定。,"Bend down and press your shoulder into your buddy’s waist.As he doubles over you, stand up straight, hoisting him clean off the ground.This will have his head down around your back, with his feet dangling around your thighs.Hook your nearest arm around his legs for stability."
7927,这是经典的消防员抢救背负方式。,This is the classic fireman’s lift.
7927,以这个姿势快速跑到大约100米处的固定目标那里，但要保证安全。,"From this position, run as fast as you safely can to a fixed goal about a hundred yards away."
7927,然后，把你的伙伴放下，再让他同样的动作把你背回来。,"Then place your partner back on his feet, and have him carry you back."
7927,双方交替重复这种折磨人的练习，只要吃得消，就尽量多次反复练习。,Repeat this torture on alternating sides for as many cycles as you can stomach.
7928,消防员抢救背负是冲刺跑的高强度训练法，需要训练伙伴。,Fireman Sprint is an intense method of sprinting that requires a training partner.
7928,在消防员冲刺跑中，弯腰并把肩膀抵在伙伴腰下，当他趴在你背上之后，站起来，顺势把他背离地面，他的头会在你的背上，双脚悬在你大腿的位置，用手钩住他的双腿以保持稳定。,"Bend down and press your shoulder into your buddy’s waist.As he doubles over you, stand up straight, hoisting him clean off the ground.This will have his head down around your back, with his feet dangling around your thighs.Hook your nearest arm around his legs for stability."
7928,这是经典的消防员抢救背负方式。,This is the classic fireman’s lift.
7929,体育具备的超越与禁锢这一个核心悖论以及它所具有的惊人的寓意化能力，是名流文化场中最显著的，而且也许是最具有变革性的。,"The paradox at the heart of sports, its simultaneously transcendent and imprisoning qualities and its astonishing capacity to allegorize, is most obvious and perhaps most transformative in the field of celebrity culture."
7929,随着消费资本主义和后现代文化的来临，身体巳经越来越表现出可见的欲望轨迹。,"With the advent of consumer capitalism and postmodern culture, the body has become an increasingly visible hcus of desire."
7929,对外表的控制通过时尚符码、身体装饰、营养计算和身体条件等来改变我们的衣着、我们感受到的欲望、我们从事的锻炼和我们消费的图像。,"The manipulation of appearance through fashion codes, bodily adornment, calculated nutrition, and physical conditioning has changed the clothes we wear, the desires we feel, the exercises we do, and the images we consume."
7930,心脏就像人体房屋的总水管，提供人生存所需的营养成分。,"Your heart, which is a lot like the water main of your anatomical house, provides the nutrients you need to live."
7930,在“房屋”中，洁净的水能让你安全地饮用，还能冲走细菌。,"In your house, clean water lets you drink safely and wash away germs."
7930,在人体内，心脏将血液抽送到身体的各个“房间”——送到大脑，让你可以思考；送到生殖器官，让你可以繁衍后代；送到消化系统，让你可以处理食物；送到肌肉，让你可以帮助邻居搬钢琴。,"In your body, your heart pumps blood to every room in your body—to your brain so you can think, to your sex organs so you can procreate, to your digestive system so you can process food, to your muscles so you can help your neighbors move their piano."
7931,当受试者笔直站立，体重均匀分布在双脚并协助将短裤拉上时，测到的右腿的围度。,"Perimeter of the right thigh which is measured when the subject stands erect, weight equally distributed on both feet, and assisting by holding clothing out of the way."
7931,要求受试者双脚稍微分开，让卷尺通过。,"Ask the subject to place the feet slightly apart, thus speading the legs to permit tape passage."
7931,将卷尺拉开，穿过小腿，然后用右手送到前面握住末端，用左手接住，握紧卷尺末端。,"Extend the tape and lay it across the calf, then reach with your right hand in front and grasp the stub end, cross over with your left hand and grasp the stub end of the tape."
7932,现在，请把呼吸系统想象成一棵倒置的树（见图5.1)。,"To start, think of your respiratory system as an upside-down tree (see Figure 5.1)."
7932,我们要追踪吸进的一口空气的旅行过程。先从口腔和鼻腔开始。,If we follow a breath of air well start with your mouth and nose.
7932,空气进入体内，顺气管向下流动。,"When air enters your body, it goes down your trachea."
7932,这就是“树干”呼吸过程开始处的一道通风管。,That's your trunk—the one airway at the beginning of the process.
7932,接着，气管分为两条支路，将空气分开输送到两边的肺中。,Then it quickly divides into two airways to feed into two lungs; those are your bronchial tubes.
7932,输送是由支气管完成的。随后，这些通风管像树枝一样，由两条分为四条，再分为八条，最后是成千上万的小通风管通向肺部。,"Then, like tree branches, those airways break off into four, then eight, then hundreds of thousands of little airways in each lung."
7932,这些都被称为细支气管，在每条气管的末端是叫做肺泡的小液囊。,Those airways are your bronchi.At the end of each airway are tiny sacs called alveoli.
7933,生活在小众媒体时代的一个结果是“名流”角色的地位降低了。,"One result of living in an age of niche media has been the diminished status of the ""celebrity"" role."
7933,即使在不到1%的美国家庭收看的各种秀中当过一阵子“明星”的人，也会出现在主流杂志的封面上。,"Even people who ""star"" on shows viewed by less than 1 % of American households find themselves on the covers of major magazines."
7933,媒体空间充斥着大多数公众对于伪名人无休无止的议论。,Much of the public is chattering away about pseudo-celebrities that clutter the media space.
7934,"萨普和豪伯斯特赖克（Sapp & Haubenstriker, 1978)发现，11-18岁年长一些的运动员（抽样调查人数为404人）不打算在来年继续参赛，重要理由中“有其他活动”的占64%,“有工作”的占44%。","Sapp and Haubenstricker (1978) found that older athletes (n = 404), ranging in age from 11 to 18 years, who indicated they did not plan to participate next year, cited other activities (64%) and working (44%) as important reasons for dropping out of sport."
7934,古尔德等人(1982) 发现，10-18岁的退役游泳运动员中49%因“有其他事要做”而放弃游泳。,Gould et al. (1982) found that 49% of the former swimmers (n = 50) between the ages of 10 and 18 dropped out of swimming because they had other things to do'.
7934,"在本章前部分引用的研究中也报道了类似结果（Athletic Footwear Association, 1980; Robertson, 1981; Sefton & Fry, 1981)。","Similar results were reported also in several of the studies cited earlier in this chapter (Athletic Footwear Association, 1980; Robertson, 1981; Sefton & Fry, 1981)."
7935,器质性杂音一般的特点是很粗糙的，而不一定是强度很大（一个功能性杂音有可能达到m-VI级)。,Organic murmurs are generally characterized by their harshness rather than their intensity (a functional murmur may in fact be grade III—VI).
7935,器质性杂音通常是不振动的，并且不受体位的明显影响。,Organic murmurs are generally not vibratory in nature and are not drastically affected by body position.
7935,"器质性杂音一方面可能代表非常轻微的心血管缺损（心房间隔缺损，atrial septal defect, 心室间隔缺损，ventricular septal defect), 另一方面可能代表更加复杂的心血管问题 (辨膜狭窄，stenotic valves，紫甜型心脏病 cyanotic heart disease)的一个部分。","Organic murmurs may represent very mild cardiovascular defects (atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect) or may be part of a more complex cardiovascular problem (stenotic valves, cyanotic heart disease)."
7936,参与者退出指个体的退出这些人曾多年投身一项或多项活动，并可能从事各种层次的比赛（即娱乐性的、竞技性的或全 国性的比赛）。,"The participant drop-out was an individual who had committed his or her time to one or more sports for a number of years and may have competed at various levels of competition (i.e.recreational, competitive or national)."
7936,对这类个体而言，当运动达不到自身要求时就可能退出。,"For this individual, dropping out may have occurred when the sport no longer met his or her needs."
7936,"另一种情况是该运动员已经处于典型的心理耗竭 (burn-out)的状况，这是有别于自愿退出的一种现象（Smith, 1986)*。","Or, this athlete may have been experiencing a classic case of 'burn-out' — a phenomenon differentiated from voluntary withdraw (Smith, 1986)."
7936,"参与者退出 后时常可能再度参加另一项运动，或者参加同一项目的其他层次运动，或者彻底退出运动（Klint & Weiss, 1986; Lindner, 1991）","* The participant dropout may, at times, return to another sport, return to the same sport at another level, or drop out completely from sport (Klint & Weiss, 1986; Lindner et al., 1991)."
7937,《开放》讲述的也是一个关于成年人的成功故事。,Open is also a story of successful adult development.
7937,"虽然阿加西和梅尔林格都没有明确提及生命历程理论，但是《开放》一书探究了从青年成年期到中年成年期的过渡，所采用的方式与艾瑞克• 埃里克森（Erik Erikson, 1959) 著名的心理社会发展模式形成了强烈的共鸣。","While neither Agassinor Moehringer referred to life-course theory explicitly, Open explores the transition from young adulthood to middle adulthood in ways that resonate strongly with Erik Erikson's (1959) well-known model of psychosocial development."
7937,简而言之，埃里克森认为人生有八个阶段，第一个阶段是出生，最后一个阶段是死亡，通过这些阶段，一个健康的人会变得成熟。,"In short, Erikson believed that there are eight phases of life, beginning at birth and ending at death, through which a healthy human matures."
7937,在每个阶段里，人们都要经历不同的冲突或者挑战，这代表了成长的一个转折点——一个人成长或是失败的机会。,"At each phase, people experience a distinct conflict or challenge that represents a turning point for development—an opportunity for personal growth or failure."
7938,也许心前区暂停吸气综合征 (precordial catch syndrome)是儿童胸痛最常见的原因（Duster，1990)。这是在胸前靠近心尖部位的锐痛。,"Perhaps the most common cause of chest pain in children is the precordial catch syndrome (Duster, 1990).These sharp pains are felt in the anterior chest, at or near the cardiac apex."
7938,疼痛历时30秒到3分钟，常常在深吸气时加剧，而在浅吸气时缓解。,This pain lasts from 30 s to 3 mm and is often aggravated by deep breathing and relieved by shallow respirations.
7938,这是良性的疼痛。,It is a benign condition.
7939,瓣膜在心脏永不停止的血液循环活动中扮演的角色极普通又极关键：瓣膜是门卫，阻止血液回流进刚刚离开的心室。,"The valves play a key and surprisingly basic role in the never-ending cycle of blood through the heart: They are doormen who keep the blood from retracing its journey, leaking backward into the chambers it has just left."
7939,在心房与心室之间，在心室与离开心室的血管之间，都有瓣膜。,"There are valves between each atrium and ventricle, and between each ventricle and the blood vessel that leaves it."
7939,血液流过后，瓣膜就会合上，发出我们在电视上听到的心跳声。,"As the blood swishes through, the valves slam shut, producing what we hear on TV as a heartbeat."
7940,器质性杂音一般的特点是很粗糙的，而不一定是强度很大（一个功能性杂音有可能达到III-VI级)。,Organic murmurs are generally characterized by their harshness rather than their intensity (a functional murmur may in fact be grade III-VI).
7940,器质性杂音通常是不振动的，并且不受体位的明显影响。,Organic murmurs are generally not vibratory in nature and are not drastically affected by body position.
7940,"器质性杂音一方面可能代表非常轻微的心血管缺损（心房间隔缺损，心室间隔缺损，ventricular septal defect), 另一方面可能代表更加复杂的心血管问题 (辨膜狭窄,紫甜型心脏病)的一个部分。","Organic murmurs may represent very mild cardiovascular defects (atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect) or may be part of a more complex cardiovascular problem (stenotic valves, cyanotic heart disease)."
7941,"叶酸（每日800微克）和每日补充符合“推荐日摄入量”（RDA)的维生素B,再加上每日3克omega-3脂肪酸和15毫克的锌，被证实能通过改善精子活性及子宫的卵子着床环境，增强生育能力。",Folate (800 micrograms a day) and the B vitamins in RDA amounts—as well as 3 daily grams of omega-3fatty acids and 15 milligrams of zinc—have been shown to help increase fertility as well by improving sperm mobility and by improving the hospitality of the uterus toward the implantation of the egg.
7941,最后，优质的左旋维生素C也能增强精子活力，它可能会很有效。当然，这取决于你是否想再要孩子。,"Finally, good ole vitamin C also will increase sperm motility, which might prove useful, depending on whether you want more kids in your life."
7942,为了能让你理解营养是怎么回事，你得知道一点关于新陈代谢的知识和身体为你获取能量而消化食物的方式。,"In order to understand nutrition, youll need to know a little abouf metabolism—and the way your body digests food for energy."
7942,大多数减肥者吃的食物肯定是不够的，还会因此减慢新陈代谢的过程。由此他们就会进入一种“假饥饿”状态，在此状态下，他们体内燃烧热量的速度就会减慢，因为身体感觉到它们需要保存热量。,"See, when most people diet, they don't eat enough—and they actually slow their metabolism; they go into a pseudo-starvation mode in which their bodies stop burning calories as fast becouse they sense they need to preserve them."
7942,这就是为什么锻炼更重要。,That's why exercise is so important.
7943,新同性恋恐惧症体现在有关这两个女人的叙事中的很多关键点上，特别体现在缺失的或是隐匿的部分。,"Neo-homophobia was manifest in narratives about both women in several key ways, but especially in what was missing or concealed."
7943,在波特兰的上升期，她的歧视在批判性的传媒叙事中是缺失的。更复杂的是在查特曼的坠落期，“正当程序”的故事情节和有关她被解雇的报道。,"Missing from the narratives were critical coverage of Portland's discrimination early in her rise, and of a more comprehensive, ""due-process"" storyline and reporting around the dismissal of Chatman during her fall."
7943,绝大多数时候，新自由主义理论也在报道中用于解释波特兰和查特曼的坠落。,"Overwhelmingly, neoliberalist rationales were also used in coverage to explain the fall of both Portland and Chatman."
7944,在讨论了大众传媒构建从神坛上跌落下来的运动员引人注目的叙事过程之后，本章现在来探索运动员怎样通过大众传播恢复他们各自的形象。,"Having discussed the processes through which mass media construct dramatic narratives about athletes falling from grace, the chapter now examines how athletes attempt to restore their respective images through mass communication."
7944,关于危机传播的文献有助于阐释个体及组织所运用和实现的这些过程。,"Scholarly literature in crisis communication helps to elucidate these processes, which apply to both individuals and organizations."
7944,"危机,一般而言，就是创造一个“信息空洞”（ Coombs, 2007)，利益相关者必须尽快给事件下定义。","Crises, in general, create ""information voids"" (Coombs, 2007), and stakeholders must scramble to define events as quickly as possible."
7945,骨骼的过度使用损伤（应力性骨折）已引起了医学界尤其是运动医学界的广泛注意。,"The overuse injury of bone (stress fracture) has attracted particular attention in medicine and, specifically, athletic medicine."
7945,"1855年，德国军医布赖特豪普特 (Breithaupt)报道了在年轻新兵中发生的此类损伤，这是有关应力性骨折的第一篇医学文献（Breithaupt, 1855)。因为多发生在军事训练中，此种损伤随后被命名为“行军骨折”。","The first reportof a stress fracture in the medical literature was that of the German military surgeon Breithaupt in 1855 who noted the occurrence of theselesions in young military recruits (Breithaupt, 1855).These lesions were subsequently identified as 'march fractures' because of their propensityfor occurrence with military training."
7945,在以后的文献中还有多种关于此类病症的命名，如疲劳性骨折、自发性骨折（spontaneous fracture)、伪性骨折 (pseudofracture)、机能不全性骨折 (insufficiency fracture) 。,"This entity has been identified in subsequent literature by a variety of terms, including fatigue fracture, spontaneous fracture, pseudofracture and insufficiency fracture."
7946,"正如哈奇（Hatch,2006)所言，这个研究从修辞者的自身兴趣延伸到了辩解书的叙事，而不是考察传统的有关形象重塑的辩解话语，其中也包含了反辩解语言行为。","Like Hatch (2006), rather than examining the traditional, apologetic discourse of image restoration, this analysis expands from the rhetor's self-interest to apologia narratives, including the antapologia speech acts."
7946,在有些例子中攻击性的话语指向了个体，但更多的不是关于一个特殊的种族群体、性别和性取向。,"In some cases the offensive remarks were directed to a single person, but more often than not, they were about a particular ethnic group, gender, or sexual orientation."
7946,因此，道歉同时也是旨在恢复修辞者的形象，并从违法行为中拯救社群。,"As such, the apologies were simultaneously designed to restore the rhetor's image and heal the community from the transgressions."
7946,"在这一研究中，修辞辩解书的五种策略（Benoit,1995)都是显著的。","In this analysis, all five tactics of rhetorical apologia (Benoit, 1995) are evident."
7947,边缘系统不是一种结构，而是联系了人脑深处的许多结构的一系列通路，比如海马状突起和杏仁核（图3.3)。,The limbic system isn't a structure but a series of pathways incorporating various structures deep inside the braint such as the hippocampus and the amygdala (Figure 3.3).
7947,你是如何观察的？视觉和听觉接收到的信息从眼耳处直接传到人脑皮质，因此我们能够识别感知，有意识地考虑信息的意义。,"Why should you care?Information gained by vision and hearing passes from the eyes and ears directly to the cortex, so we recognize the sensation and can consciously consider its meaning."
7947,另一方面，嗅觉绕过脑皮质，直接影响杏仁核，于是，在我们还没有有意识地处理信息前，身体已经做出反应。,"On the other hand, smell sensations bypass the cortex and influence the amygdala directly, so our body responds before we can consciously process the information."
7947,杏仁核控制情感、情绪和与抑郁焦虑有关的其他功能，邻近的海马状突起则负责处理和储存短期记忆。,"The amygdala is responsible for emotions, moods, and other functions related to depression and anxiety, and the nearby hippocampus is responsible for the processing and storage of short-term memory."
7948,另一方面，女孩的无氧工作能力刚过青春期就停止增长了，随后保持在固定水平上或稍有下降。,"In girls, on the other hand, anaerobic performance improves only until just after puberty and then remains constant or even slightly reduced."
7948,"一般而言，从上面提到的研究报告（Blimkie et al.，1988; Inbar, 1985; Inbar & Bar-Or, 1986; Saavedra et al., 1991)的实际功率输出数据看，9〜11 岁男孩和女孩之间大腿无氧功率或耐力的 绝对值没有显著性的差异。","On average, and based on the actual power output data reported in the above-mentioned original studies (Blimkie et al., 1988; Inbar, 1985; Inbar & Bar-Or, 1986; Saavedra et al., 1991), no meaningful differences are observed in absolute leg anaerobic power or endurance between girls and boys at 9—11 years of age."
7948,但是，从13岁之后，性别之间就出现了显著差异。,"However, significant differences appear between genders from 13 years of age on."
7949,雄性精子速度固然较快，但雌性精子就像乌龟，它们一直慢慢地前进，可以耐心地等上几天。,"While male sperm are faster, female sperm are like tortoises—they keep pushing ahead slowly, hanging out and waiting a few days."
7949,为了生育男孩，在排卵期前后进行性交至关重要，不然女性一方就会获胜。,"For boys, copulation around ovulation is critical, or the females will win."
7949,顺便提一句，尽管精子由男性产生，女性对精子的接受程度则因人而异，正因为此，在决定后代性别上，两性都起到一定作用。,"By the way, although the sperm is made by males, the receptiveness to sperm varies with females, which is why both genders have some role in determining the sex of the offspring."
7950,有些情况下，心动图和胸部X线检查是很有用的。,"In some instances, an ECG and chest radiogram are useful."
7950,通常，在作出合适的推荐之前，运动耐力试验，24小时心电图和心脏导管检査，必要时血管造影都是很有必要的。,"Often, an exercise tolerance test, 24 h ECG and cardiac catheterization, with or without angiography, is required before proper recommendations are made."
7950,我们建议读者在作出先天性心脏病人参加运动的推荐意见之前参考上述文件。,The reader is referred to this paper before making recommendations for participation in individuals with congenital heart disease.
7951,胸廊横径（transverse chest width)胸廓最外侧部分之间的距离。,Transverse chest width.Distance of the most lateral aspect of the thorax.
7951,测试者靠近取笔直坐位、面向操作者的受试者。,Approach the subject who sits erect facing you.
7951,从胸骨中点水平将夹子双臂向下与水平面约呈 30°，测量最宽的直径，要避开胸大肌和背阔肌的轮廓。,From the mesosternale level apply the branches at an angle of about 30° downward from the horizontal to encompass the widest diameter avoiding both the pectoral and latissim us dorsi muscle contours.
7951,当定位正确时，将拇指从压紧的夹子双臂松开，将手轻微向外旋转，用两个食指沿着夹子双臂施加中等程度的压力。,"When the site is approximated, remove your thumbs from the pinch grasp of the branches slightly rotating your hands outwards and applying moderate pressure along the branches with your index fingers."
7951,在正常呼气的末期进行测量。,Make themeasurement at the end o f the normal expiratory excursion (end-tidal).
7952,胸腺在你的免疫系统中发挥着关键作用，因为它是你的T细胞成熟的地方。,The thymus plays a crucial role in your immune system because this is where your T cells mature.
7952,T细胞是救助细胞，是前来为最初的紧急呼叫加强增援的。,T cells are those helper cells that come in and add reinforcements to the ini­tial emergency call.
7952,一部分T细胞动员其他细胞进入战斗，并传播战斗的消息。,Some convince other cells to enter the fray and spread the news of battle.
7953,雄性激素是蛋白质合成的重要调节因素。,Male hormones are important regulators of protein synthesis.
7953,成年男子雄性激素的活性约是青春期前的儿童和成年女子的10倍。,"Adult males have about 10 times the activity level of androgens, compared with prepubertal children or adult women."
7953,假设所有其他因素都相等，也只能当雄性激素达到成年水平时，肌肉力量及其增长幅度才能达到最高值。,"Assuming all other factors being equal, maximal strength and strength-gaining potential is not possible until adult levels of androgens are achieved."
7954,由于迷走兴奋能增加安静时支气管活动张力，所以抗胆碱能药物像阿托品一样能使一些人的支气管扩张。,"Since vagal input increases resting bronchomotor tone, anticholinergic agents like atropine may cause bronchodilatation in some people."
7954,溴化异丙托品 (ipratropium bromide) (Atrovent)是阿托品的一种季铵衍生物，当用定量-剂量吸入器吸入时，吸收量很少，因此阿托品样副作用（口干，视觉问题等）减少了。,"Ipratropium bromide (Atrovent) is a quartemary ammonium derivative of atropine, and when taken by metered-dose inhaler, is absorbed only poorly, thus reducing atropine-like side-effects (dry mouth, visual problems, etc.)."
7954,溴化异丙托品对某些患者有用，但预防运动性哮喘的作用稍差（Lemanske & Henke，1989) 。,"Ipratropium bromide has become a useful agent for some patients, but has only moderate effectiveness in preventing EIA (Lemanske & H enke, 1989)."
7955,"零食在儿童营养摄入和膳食方式中起着重要的作用（Thomas-Doberson,1989；Lucas 1993）。","Snacks may significantly contribute to the child's nutrient intake and eating style (Thomas-Doberson, 1989; Lucas 1993)."
7955,所吃零食的数量有可能决定摄入的营养需求是否达到要求。,The quality of snacks eaten may determine whether nutrient requirements are being met.
7955,所以，吃零食的频率和零食的种类是要重点考虑的因素。,"Therefore, the frequency of snacking and type of snacks are important considerations."
7956,人们用来创造这种有连贯感的特定认知策略称为“自传式推理”或“思考过去并将其与自身联系起来的一个动态过程”。因此，通过自传式推理浮现出来的人生故事或是叙事认同揭示了随着时间推移的连续性，同时也显现出了所发生的变化。与叙事理论相一致的是，我们并不把阿加西的自传当作其生活的真实记录；相反，《开放》是一个传媒文本（同对其分析一样），过去本身就是“在回忆的时候，被传媒化的事实生产的”。,"The specific, cognitive strategy people use to create this sense of coherence is termed autobiographical reasoning or ""the dynamic process of thinking about the past to make links to the self. The life story or narrative identity that emerges through autobiographical reasoning thus reveals continuity over time while also manifesting change. Consistent with narrative theory, we do not approach Agassi's autobiography as a factual account of his life. Rather, Open is a media text (as is this analysis of it) and the past itself is ""mediated, indeed produced, in the activity of remembering""."
7957,所谓叙述法或是连续记录法是指在进行观察记录时，根据欲被观察之事件发生的顺序，以连续性文字记录下他所观察到的所有事件，这是所有观察记录方法中，最慢也最没有效率的一种。,"With the narrative method, or the method of continual-recording, researchers record in a series of sentences the occurrences that they observe as they happen.This method of recording is the slowest and least efficient."
7957,由于无法将所有发生在某一个情境中的所有事件都记录下来，因此观察者必须具备能将重要讯息实时筛选与记录的能力。,The observer must be able to select the most important information to record because not everything that occurs in a given situation can be recorded.
7957,这种技巧的最大优点可能就是，能帮助研究者去发展出更有效率的记录工具。,Probably the best use of this technique is in helping to develop more efficient recording instruments.
7958,在做悬垂半举腿时，抓住高过头顶的横杆，身体成一条直线，双脚离地，双肩收紧。,"In the hanging partial straight leg raise, hang from an overhead bar, with your body in a straight line and your feet off the floor.Tighten the shoulders."
7958,双腿锁定，然后慢慢抬起，使之与地面之间的夹角成45°。,"Lift the locked legs until they are at a forty-five degree angle, and hold."
7958,这是该动作的起始姿势。膝关节保持锁定，然后平缓地抬起双腿，直到它们与地面平行。这是该动作的结束姿势。,"Keeping your knees locked straight, smoothly raise your legs until they are parallel with the floor."
7958,暂停一会，然后放下双腿，回到起始姿势，如此重复。,"Pause for a moment, before lowering the legs back to a forty-five degree angle.Repeat."
7958,举腿时呼气，下降时吸气，腹部保持收紧。,"Exhale as your legs move up, inhale as they move down.Keep the abs tight."
7959,在做悬垂屈举腿时，向上跳起，抓住高过头顶的横杆。身体成成一直线，双脚离地。,"In the hanging bent leg raise, grab an overhead bar so that your body is in a straight line and your feet are clear of the ground."
7959,双手大致与肩同宽，肩部收紧。,"Your hands should be approximately shoulder width, and your shoulders kept nice and tight."
7959,弯曲膝盖，直到膝关节大约成 135°，双脚置于身后几厘米。,Now bend at the knees until your knee joints are angled off straight by around forty-five degrees.This will put your feet a few inches behind the rest of your hanging body.
7959,以髋部为轴，平缓地抬起双腿，直到双脚与骨盆在一个高度上。,Smoothly raise your legs at the hips until your feet are opposite your pelvis.
7959,暂停一下，然后做反向动作，如此重复。,"Pause and reverse the motion, before repeating."
7959,整个运动过程中，只能移动髋部，屈膝弯度要保持锁定。,Only move at the hips; keep your knee angle “locked” into place.
7959,举腿时呼气，下降时吸气，始终保持收腹。,"Exhale as you raise your legs, inhale as you lower them.Keep the abs tense."
7960,在做悬垂屈膝时，向上跳起，抓住高过头顶的横杆，双手与肩同宽。,"In hanging knee raises, jump up and grab an overhead bar.Your hands should be about shoulder width apart."
7960,横杆要够高，以使身体悬垂时双脚依然离地，即使离地仅有一厘米。,"The bar needs to be high enough that your feet hang clear from the ground, even if only by an inch."
7960,身体成一条直线，保持肩部收紧。,"Your body should be in a straight line, and you must keep your shoulders “tight”."
7960,平缓地抬起膝盖，直到双膝与骨盆处于同一高度，膝关节弯曲成90°，大腿与地面平行。,Bring your knees up smoothly until they are level with your pelvis and your knees are at a right angle.Your thighs will be parallel with the floor.
7960,在以上运动过程中呼气，同时保持收腹。,"Exhale during this motion, keeping your stomach pulled in."
7960,暂停一下，然后反向运动，直到身体完全伸展。在此过程中吸气，然后重复练习。,"Pause for a moment, then reverse the motion until your body is fully extended, inhaling as you go.Repeat."
7961,悬垂蛙举腿的起始姿势与第七式悬垂屈举腿相同，就像做第七式一样，抬起双腿。,"In hanging frog raises, assume a start position identical to Step 7, hanging bent leg raises, and raise your legs just as you would for that same exercise."
7961,双脚与髋部在同一高度时，再将双脚伸向正前方，直至双腿完全伸直。,"Once you reach the top position with your feet in line with your hips, extend your feet out in a line directly away from you, so that your legs are perfectly straight."
7961,这时双腿与地面平行，即与上半身之间的夹角成90度。,"This will put your locked legs level with the floor, and your upper and lower body at a right angle."
7961,暂停一下，但不要反向运动。,"Pause for a moment, but do not reverse the motion."
7961,然后慢慢放下双腿，在此过程中双腿始终伸直。,"Instead, lower your legs while keeping them locked out perfectly straight ."
7961,该动作完成时，身体完全伸展。然后回到起始姿势，重复练习。举腿时呼气，下降时吸气，腹部从始至终都要收紧。,"Finish with your body fully extended before assuming the start position again and repeating for the desired number of reps. Exhale as the legs are going up, inhale as they are going down, and keep the stomach tucked in at all times."
7962,现在你已经知道该怎么做悬垂直举腿了。,You know the hanging straight leg raise by now!
7962,抓住头顶的横杆，要保证身体悬垂时双脚依然离地。,Take hold of an overhead bar which is high enough to leave your feet a short distance from the floor when your body is extended.
7962,双手大致与肩同宽，双肩收紧。,Your hands should be approximately shoulder width apart.Ensure that the shoulders are tight.
7962,这是该动作的起始姿势。,This is the start position.
7962,平缓地举起双腿，直到它们与地面平行，此过程至少要持续2秒钟。,Smoothly— over the course of at least two seconds—raise your legs until they are parallel with the floor.
7962,举腿时呼气，尽量将所有气体都呼出肺部，使腹部完全收紧。,"Exhale as your legs rise, blowing all the air you can out of your lungs so that the abdomen is fully contracted."
7962,这是该动作的结束姿势。,This is the finish position.
7962,暂停一下，然后反向运动，回到起始姿势，这一过程至少也要持续2秒钟，在此过程中吸气。,"Pause, before reversing the motion perfectly for at least another two seconds until you are back in the start position.Inhale as you go."
7962,即使在起始姿势中腹部也要收紧，两腿始终锁定，整个运动过程中只用肌肉控制，不要用惯性。,"Remain “flexed,” even in the start position.Your legs must stay locked at all times and you must use pure muscular control; no momentum allowed."
7963,注意，心脏在运转正常时就像一台机器，工作效率高得令人惊讶。,"See, when your heart is working right, it's an astoundingly efficient machine."
7963,为人体肌肉输送养料的血管柔软地相互连通，像自行车的橡胶内胎一样，在需要时会伸展。,The blood vessels supplying the muscles in your body are open and supple like rubber bicycle inner tubes that expand as needed.
7963,血管让人体心脏可以将血液抽至全身各处，不论人体需要多少血液。,"The blood vessels leaving your heart shuttle blood throughout your body from one source to another, no matter how much you need."
7964,血管问题：当脑部供血不足，缺血会导致轻度中风，损害记忆。,"Vascular problems: When insufficient blood gets to the brain, the lack of blood flow can cause mini-strokes and impair memory."
7964,阿兹海默病：在这种情况下，神经细胞互相纠结，无法正常工作。,"Alzhemier's: Here, neurons tangle with other neurons, causing them to stop working properly."
7964,丧失神经细胞：许多与衰老有关的健康问题都是由于神经细胞丧失或神经细胞功能丧失而引发的。若丧失了部分脑物质，就丧失了部分脑功能。,"Neuron loss: Many age-related problems are caused by the loss of neurons or the loss of the function of those neurons; literally, you're losing part of your mind."
7965,血管系统贯穿于整个消化系统之中，它负责输送源自食物的养料，将营养物质运到人体的主要器官。（我们从科学上证明了“要征服男人的心，先要征服他的胃”。,"Throughout, you have vascular systems that transport nutrients from the food and deliver it to your body's major organs(which scientifically proves that a way to a man's heart is through his stomach)."
7965,）小肠决定了要保留哪些有益物质后，就将废物直接运至盲肠（盲肠是位于大肠起始处的水库，储存小肠排出的液体）。,"After the samll intestine decides what to keep, it shuttles the waste along into the cecum, a reservoir at the beginning of the large intestine that folds fluid from the samll bowel."
7966,应该避免食用高脂肪和高蛋白食物， 因为它们的消化时间长于碳水化合物食 品，如果在赛前食用会导致消化不良和恶心。,"High fat and high protein foods should be avoided because they take longer to digest than carbohydrate foods and, if eaten for the pre-event meal can contribute to indigestion and nausea."
7966,儿童在赛前还应避免进食单纯的碳水化合物，如蔗糖、糖果、蜂蜜或软 饮料，它们并不提供“快速能量”，而且有些运动员食用这些单纯的糖时比其他运动员更容易引起血糖水平的变化。,"Children should also avoid eating simple carbohydrates such as sugar, sweets, honey or soft drinks before exercise.They do not provide 'quick energy', and some athletes are more sensitive than others to changes in blood glucose levels when simple sugars are eaten."
7966,相反，在面包、谷类、面食、大米和其他淀粉类食物中的复合碳水化合物应包括在赛前的食谱之中。,"Instead, complex carbohydrates which are found in breads, cereals, pasta, rice and other starchy foods should be included in the pre-event meal."
7966,这些食物能被迅速消化，儿童的胃在赛前很快排空，血糖水平也能维持稳定。,"These foods are digested relatively quickly, so that the child's stomach is empty and blood sugar level is stable before practice or competition."
7967,我们应该每周吃三次鱼。,You should eat three portions of fish per week.
7967,鱼类，尤其是脂肪鱼，如鲑鱼，或白鲑，如鳕鱼和鲈鱼，都富含欧米伽-3脂肪酸，好处多多。,"Fish, especially fatty fish like salmon and whitefish like cod or bass, is high in those omega-3 fatty acids, which have several powerful benefits."
7967,欧米伽-3脂肪酸能降低血液中的甘油三酸酯含量 (含量过高会造成动脉中血小板淤积）， 稳定心跳（减少心律不齐的发生），让血小板黏稠度下降（减少动脉阻塞的情况），也许还能降低血压。,"They appear to reduce triglyceride levels in the blood (high levels cause plaque buildup in the arteries), stabilize the heartbeat (reducing irregular rhythms), make platelets less sticky (reducing clotting), and may bring down blood pressure as well."
7968,这些巨大泡沫状细胞非常贪婪，人体供血渐渐无法赶上它们生长的速度。,"Those big, foamy cells get so greedy they outgrow the blood supply."
7968,这时，一些泡沫细胞会因缺血而饿死，临死的细胞变得“易怒”。像我们有时梳头会被静电打到一样，在这些细胞上也产生了电荷。,"When that happens, some of them begin to starve from lack of blood, and as they die, they become ""irritable""一they have an electrical charge to them, similar to the electric shock you get sometimes while combing your hair."
7968,这种电荷吸引来更多“十六七岁的不速之客”即黏稠的血小板。它们喜欢成群活动，在动脉中形成血凝块。,"That charge attracts even more of the Busch-drinking, sixteen-year-old party crashers: sticky blood platelets, which like to travel in crowds and form clots in your arteries."
7969,大多数健美与力量训练计划都有“循环”或“周期”之类的概念。,Most bodybuilding and strength training programs contain the concepts of “cycling” or “periodization.”
7969,其实就是在训练期中调节强度，这就意味着训练有时容易，有时适中，有时很难。,"These are just ways of varying intensity throughout the training year—meaning that training is sometimes easy, sometimes moderate, sometimes hard."
7969,在健美与力量举训练中通常需要这样做，因为重量训练会刺激关节，损耗人体的免疫系统，但正确的自身体重训练不会如此。,"This is often necessary in bodybuilding and powerlifting, because weight-training irritates the joints and depletes the body’s hormonal-immune system in a way that proper bodyweight work does not."
7970,为什么要通过训练计划进行循序渐进的锻炼，这有个极好的理由，就是“训练势头”。,There is a damn good reason why you should proceed slowly and methodically through any training program.The reason has to do with generating training momentum.
7970,简单地说，这意味着如果你在训练中更慢地向前推进，你实际上会比急于求成者更快达到目标。,"Basically put, this means that if you build a head of steam by moving forwards more slowly, you’ll actually reach your goals much faster than if you proceeded with haste."
7970,听着像悖论，但这就是事实。,"This sounds like a paradox, but it’s true."
7971,如果你通过举腿和深蹲系列培养了一定的力量基础，那么练习桥系列的前三式应该问题不大。,"If you have built a base of strength with your leg raises and squats, these exercises will not pose much of a problem."
7971,即使这样也不要急于求成，要培养而不要破坏训练的势头。,"But don’t be in a rush.Build on your training momentum, don’t destroy it."
7971,你不妨在桥系列中多花些时间，毕竟我们的脊柱极为珍贵，值得善待。,Take your time with these exercises more than any other; your spine is precious.Be kind to it.
7972,众所周知，牙齿的两大功能是处理食物和抵挡迎面飞来的冰球。,Everybody knows the two primory things teeth are used for—eating and stopping hockey pucks.
7972,但是也许会令你感到惊奇的是，牙齿还有一个功能，是其他身体外部器官都不具备的，那就是牙齿可以成为身体健康的“晴雨表”。,But what may surprise you is that your teeth can provide clues into your health like virtually no other outward part of your body.
7972,为什么呢？,Why?
7972,牙齿长到最后最要注意的不是蛀牙而是牙周疾病，它能够使你的生理年龄老上3.7岁。,"The biggest concern when it comes to aging and your teeth isn't the presence of cavities; it's the presence of periodontal disease, which can make you up to 3.7 years older."
7972,牙龈疾病（牙龈炎）与许多健康问题相关，引起牙周炎的病菌同样也会引发人体免疫系统的反应，造成动脉血管发炎硬化。,"Gum disease (gingivitis) has been linked to many other health problems, presumably because the same bacteria that cause periodontal disease can also trigger an immune response that causes inflammation and hardening of the arteries."
7973,众所周知，牙齿的两大功能是处理食物和抵挡迎面飞来的冰球。,Everybody knows the two primory things teeth are used for—eating and stopping hockey pucks.
7973,但是也许会令你感到惊奇的是，牙齿还有一个功能，是其他身体外部器官都不具备的，那就是牙齿可以成为身体健康的“晴雨表“。,But what may surprise you is that your teeth can provide clues into your health like virtually no other outward part of your body.
7973,为什么呢？,Why?
7973,牙齿长到最后最要注意的不是蛀牙而是牙周疾病，它能够使你的生理年龄老上3.7岁。,"The biggest concern when it comes to aging and your teeth isn't the presence of cavities; it's the presence of periodontal disease, which can make you up to 3.7 years older."
7974,那么学习这些动作需要多长时间呢?,How long will it take to learn the movements?
7974,"根据年龄、运动背景、灵活性、受伤史等问题,这个过程大约需要一个月,或者也许几个月。","Depending on age, athletic background, mobility issues, and injury history, among other factors,this may take just a month.Or it may take a number of months."
7974,"当你第一次尝试火箭推(一个单独的爆发力动作,组合了颈前深蹲和过顶推举)、过顶深蹲或者严格的引体向上(体操运动员标准的全身引体向上)动作时,你也许会觉得力不从心。","The first time you try a thruster (a taxing combination of a front squat and overhead press into a single, explosive movement), an overhead squat, or a kipping pull-up (pull-ups with a gymnast’s full-body kip move), you might think you’re in over your head."
7974,反正我开始也是这么认为的。,"That’s what I thought, anyway."
7974,"但是如果你保持谦虚、耐心和坚持的态度,你会惊喜地发现身体的改变。","But if you remain humble, patient, and consistent, you will be surprised at how well your body responds."
7975,麦肯齐抛弃了原来高碳水化合物的饮食方式，选择了能帮助他减少身体炎症发生的饮食方案。,MacKenzie dumped his high-carbohydrate diet and played with diets that helped reduce the body’s inflammation levels rather than jack them up.
7975,他几乎利用了能用到的所有技术手段，包括心率监测仪、脉搏血氧计、高海拔帐篷、代谢测试和血液乳酸分析仪。,"He used all the technologies he could get his hands on, from heart rate monitors to pulse oximeters, high-altitude tents, metabolic testing, and blood lactate analyzers."
7975,麦肯齐还开始测试不同的跑步训练方案。,MacKenzie also began testing out different models of run training.
7976,文献分析是研究形式中的一种。,An analysis of the literature is a part of all types of research.
7976,学者总是觉察到许多过去事件，以及它们如何影响目前的研究。但是，有时候文献回顾本身就是一个研究，其用以分析、评估与整合已发表的文献。,"The scholar is always however, the literature review stands by itself as a research paper that analyzes, aware of past events and how they influence current research.Sometimes, evaluates, and integrates the published literature."
7976,以一个专有名词来形容，它可称为研究整合。,A term used to describe this is research synthesis.
7977,此练习由捷克科学家扬达发明，故有此名。,Janda sit-ups are named after the Czech scientist who invented them.
7977,扬达仰卧起坐与普通仰卧起坐的不同在于：整个动作中双脚用力向下压，同时又要使臀部与腘绳肌尽量收紧。,"They are identical to normal sit-ups, with the exception that you press down hard on the floor with the soles of your feet throughout the exercise, while clenching your glutes and hamstrings as tightly as you can."
7977,这样做仰卧起坐的用意是使艘部屈肌不动，因为从结构上看，髋部屈肌的位置与臀部和腘绳肌相对，这一理论被称为“交互抑制” 。,The thinking behind this says that doing your sit-ups this way takes the hip flexors out of the movement because the hip flexors are anatomically opposite the glutes and hamstrings.The underlying theory is called reciprocal inhibition.
7978,经典而简单的动作，它可以训练你的中段与臀部。,A classic yet simple exercise which works the entire midsection and hips.
7978,平躺在地上，双脚钩住坚固的物体，以髋部为轴向上弯曲身体。,"Lie on the floor, hook your feet under something sturdy and bend at the hips."
7978,仰卧起坐一直以来总是被指责为对脊柱有害，其实如果膝盖弯曲的角度合适，就不会有问题。,"The sit-up has got a bad rap as being dangerous or the spine, but if you bend well at the knees this is a total fallacy."
7978,双手不要放头后，否则可能会拉伤颈部，而是应该握拳置于太阳穴处，然后拉起上身，直到肘部接触膝盖。,"Don’t put your hands behind your head, or you can strain the ligaments in your neck.Instead, put your fists to your temples and come up until your elbows touch your knees."
7978,很多人说仰卧起坐并不能真的锻炼腹肌，但这些人显然并不做仰卧起坐。,"I’ve read a lot of garbage saying that sit-ups don’t work the abdomen, but whoever writes this junk obviously isn’t doing sit-ups."
7978,如果你把这个美丽的动作做上几百次，那么第二天你就可以感受到美妙的酸痛——从胸骨一直到骨盆。,"A few hundred reps of this beauty will make your abs deliciously sore the next day, from sternum down to pelvis."
7979,腰痛是青少年运动员最常见的主诉之一。,Low back pain is one of the most common complaints in young athletes.
7979,腰部过伸的动作是引起腰痛的主要原因。,
7979,,Activities that result in hyperextension of the back have all been cited as common aggravating activities that precipitate this condition.
7979,"这样的动作包括橄榄球运动中的阻截、举重的推举塌腰（Military press)、撑竿跳、跳水、投掷、体操和网球发球等动作（Jackson, 1979)。","These activities include football blocking, military press in weight-lifting, pole vaulting, diving, pitching, gymnastics and serving in tennis (Jackson, 1979)."
7980,人体高效的消化系统能从食物中提取出最多的能量。,Our remarkably efficient digestive system extracts the most calories possible.
7980,这一过程从口腔中的颞下颌关节幵始。在咀嚼食物时，颞卜颌关节会松开，让咬肌能更用力地挤压食物。,The process starts in the mouth with a temporomandibular jaw (TMJ) joint that purposely dislocates during chewing in order to allow the masseter muscle to compress food more forcefully.
7980,牙齿像拼图积木一样紧紧相合，确保没有漏嚼食物，令消化充分。,The teeth fit together like puzzle pieces to ensure that no morsel is left unchewed and underdigested.
7980,经常咬紧牙关或颌骨太紧，往往造成颞下颌关节疼痛和头痛。,Clenching teeth and having a tight jaw often cause TMJ pain and headaches.
7981,药球投射：这项练习可帮助改善灵活性、协调性和持久度。,"Wall Ball: This exercise is a metabolic firestorm that develops mobility, coordination, and stamina."
7981,双手在下方拖住药球，使药球位于下巴下方、胸部上方。,Place your hands underneath a medicine ball and center it beneath your chin and against your chest.
7981,像做颈前深蹲一样下蹲，腹股沟(髋部折痕)保持在膝盖水平面以下，然后用躯干发力起身，顺势推起药球。,"Drop down as if performing a front squat, with your hip crease passing beneath the plane of your knees, then explode upward, powering the ball with the momentum generated by your trunk."
7981,完全展开身体后，将药球推向空中，瞄准建筑或墙壁的标记位置，一般是离地面3米的高度。,"After full extension, press the ball into the air, shooting for a mark on a building or wall, 10 feet above the ground."
7981,接住回弹下落的药球，按照同样的路径回到深蹲的位置，这样视为完成一次动作。重复此动作。,Catch the ball on the rebound and retrace the same pathway back to the bottom of the squat for 1 rep. Repeat.
7982,神经细胞利用化学信息彼此交流。,Neurons communicate with one another using chemical messages.
7982,以抑郁症为例，一个神经细胞发送信息（前突触），将肾上腺皮质激素传递出去，另一个细胞“捉住”这种化学物质，将信息传播下去（后突触）。,"In one model of depression, serotonin is passed from the cell sending a message (presynaptic) to a cell that can atchff the chemical and propagate the information (postsynaptic)."
7982,如果将肾上腺皮质激素击走（与棒球运动类似：接手接不住棒球，球就会被击球手击出去），人就会感到抑郁。,"If something bats the serotonin away, you feel more depressed."
7982,如果能增加肾上腺皮质激素分泌接收，那么就会刺激更多的后突触神经细胞，人的抑郁感就会减少。许多治疗抑郁症的药物都是依据这种原理研制成功的。,"If something increases the serotonin that is released and received, then more postsynaptic cells are excited and the less depressed you (eel. Many medications work in this way)."
7983,叶黄素 是一种在玉米、菠菜和其他一些绿叶疏菜中发现的物质。人们发现这是一种对维持视力和加强眼部健康最有益的物质之一。,"LUTEIN It's a substance that's found in corn, spinach, and other leafy green vegetables, and it's been found to be one of the substances most beneficial for main taining sight and improving the health of your eyes."
7983,我们不确定有多少沖选择方法对于减慢衰老发挥作用，我们只知道 它们的确在起作用，叶黄素就是这类物质之一。,"We're not sure how many choices work to slow or reverse aging, just that they do—and lutein is one of the things that falls into that category."
7984,叶酸是维生素B族的一种。医生们经常给孕妇幵这沖药，因为它对于胎儿的大脑和脊髓的正常发育是十分重要的。,"Folate or folic acid, which is part of the B complex of vitamins, is often prescribed for pregnant women because it's essential for the normal development of the brain and spinal cord of the fetus."
7984,但是如果母亲开始摄入叶酸以防止胎儿脊柱裂 (一种先天性缺陷），研究发现这样做也降低了儿童时期的癌症发病率60%。,"But when mothers started taking folate to prevent spina bifida (a specific birth defect), we also saw a 60 percent reduction in childhood cancers."
7985,人体所有动脉受到一种称为一氧化氮的气体作用，血管会扩张，这种气体滞留在人体内的时间很短。,All of your arteries are dilated by a short-lived gas called nitric oxide.
7985,一旦一氧化氮消解，人体又迅速地制造出新的一氧化氮。但动脉硬化会减缓这一进程。,You continue to make this gas as quickly as it dissolves—unless the hardening of your arteries slows the process.
7985,人体缺乏足量的一氧化氮，动脉无法张开，在人行走或运动时无法给心脏或腿部提供足够的能量。,"Without enough nitric oxide, your arteries are unable to open up and feed more energy to your heart or your legs when you walk or exercise."
7986,糖尿病不是一个病，而是有多种不同原因的一个综合征。,"Diabetes mellitus is not a disease, but a syndrome with a number of different causes."
7986,高血糖症和糖尿是临床上的特点。,"Clinically, it is characterized by hyperglycaemia and glycosuria."
7986,如果不经过治疗，会发展为酸中毒和酮中毒（酮症），脱水，昏迷和死亡。,"If untreated, it may progress to acidosis and ketosis, dehydration, coma and death."
7986,少年糖尿病是胰腺β-细胞内源性胰岛素供应不足引起的，所以要用胰岛素进行治疗。,Diabetes of juvenile onset is usually due to a deficiency in the endogenous supply of insulin by the pancreatic (β-cells and should therefore be treated by the administration of insulin.
7986,胰岛素依赖型糖尿病(insulin -dependent diabetes mellitus，HDDM)现在称为I型糖尿病。,Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is now called type I diabetes.
7986,β-细胞的完全衰竭要经过数年的时间。,"Total exhaustion of the (β-cells, however, may take several years."
7987,"膜岛素浓度较高时，除胰岛素自身因素外，有其他因素介入到体力活动时增强葡萄糖耐量的调节中去：1.血流动力学改变（Garratt ef al.， 1972； Hespel et al., 1995)。2.","At higher insulin concentrations, other factors than insulin itself were implicated in the increased glucose tolerance during physical activity:1 Haemodynamic changes (Garratt et al., 1972; Hespel et al., 1995).2"
7987,除胰岛素以外的体液因子的活性，如胰岛素样生长因子-1 (IGF-1 (Couturier ei al.，1971)。3.,"Activity of humoral factors other than insulin such as insulin-like growth factor-i (IGF-i) (Couturier el al., 1971).3"
7987,"激肽（kinins)和前列腺素 (prostaglandins)的参与（Dietze, 1982)。4.","Involvement of kinins and prostaglandins (Dietze, 1982).4"
7987,胰岛素受体的敏感性和数量的改变（Soman ei al.，1979; Pedersen et al.， 1980; Bonen et al.，1985)。,"Modifications of the sensitivity and number of insulin receptors (Somanet al., 1979; Pedersen et al., 1980; Bonen et al., 1985).5"
7987,"5.骨豁肌葡萄糖载体（glucose transporters, GLUT4)的激活（Bonadonna et al.，1993)。","Activation of skeletal muscle glucose transporters (GLUT4) (Bonadonna et al., 1993)."
7988,糖尿病不是一个病，而是有多种不同原因的一个综合征。,"Diabetes mellitus is not a disease, but a syndrome with a number of different causes."
7988,高血糖症和糖尿是临床上的特点。,"Clinically, it is characterized by hyperglycaemia and glycosuria."
7988,如果不经过治疗，会发展为酸中毒和酮中毒（酮症），脱水，昏迷和死亡。,"If untreated, it may progress to acidosis and ketosis, dehydration, coma and death."
7988,少年糖尿病是胰腺β-细胞内源性胰岛素供应不足引起的，所以要用胰岛素进行治疗。,Diabetes of juvenile onset is usually due to a deficiency in the endogenous supply of insulin by the pancreatic (β-cells and should therefore be treated by the administration of insulin.
7988,胰岛素依赖型糖尿病(insulin -dependent diabetes mellitus，HDDM)现在称为I型糖尿病。,Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is now called type I diabetes.
7988,β-细胞的完全衰竭要经过数年的时间。,"Total exhaustion of the (β-cells, however, may take several years."
7989,"如果儿童不能下咽糖，家庭成员或学校职工应予肌肉注射或皮下注射胰高血糖素 (glucagon), 10岁以下儿童的剂量为0.5 mg, 10岁以上给全剂量1mg。","If the child is unable to swallow sugar, a member of the family or school staff should inject glucagon i.m .or s.c.( < 10 years of age: 0.5 mg; > 10 years of age: 1 mg = full dose)."
7989,注射后，神志在5-10分钟内恢复，但胰高血糖素可引起头痛和恶心。,Consciousness returns within 5-10 min but glucagon may provoke headache and nausea.
7989,现有一种新的胰高血糖素，经鼻给药法。,A new device is being produced for nasal administration of glucagon.
7989,如果用胰高血糖素无效，必须静脉注入高渗葡萄糖溶液。,"If glucagonis ineffective, hypertonic glucose solution must be given i.v ."
7990,已经制定了年龄和性别特有的标准，可以将家长身高的遗传因素与其他影响儿童线性生长的因素（如营养不良和疾病）区别开来。,"Age- and sex-specific standards have been developed to separate the genetic contribution of parental stature from other factors that affect a child's linear growth, such as malnutrition or disease."
7990,一个儿童的实际身高可用其家长身高的平均值加以校正。,A child's actual height can be adjusted with a factor derived from the average of each parent's height.
7990,"这个方法是用 来评估按年龄要求的身高低于第5百分位的儿童（Garm & Rohmann, 1966; Himes et al., 1985)。","This method is recommended for evaluating children whose height for age is less that the 5th percentile (Garm & Rohmann, 1966; Himes et al., 1985)."
7991,大多数女孩看医生只是为了放心。,Most girls will require only reassurance.
7991,如果需要治疗，通常是用促性腺性类固醇激素治疗，每天5-20μg，治疗几个月。最常用的是每天0.3-0.6mg符合雌性激素或乙基雌二醇。,"If therapy is needed, it is usually with gonadal steroid hormones, often 0.3—0.6mg daily conjugated equine oestrogens or ethinyl oestradiol, 5—20 μg daily for several months."
7992,已知组间差异法(known group difference method) 有时会被用来建立构念效度。,The known group difference method is sometimes used in establishing construct validity.
7992,例如无氧运动能力测验的构念效度可以藉由比较短跑与跳远选手和长跑选手的测验得分来证明。,"For example, construct validity of a test of anaerobic power could be demonstrated by comparing the test scores of sprinters and jumpers with those of distance runners."
7992,短跑与跳远比长跑要求更高的无氧运动能力。,Sprinting and jumping require greater anaerobic power than distance running does.
7992,"因此 ,施测者可以了解此测验是否可以区分两种不同运动类型选手的表现。","Therefore, the tester could determine whether the test differentiates between the two kinds of track performers."
7992,"如果短跑与跳远选手的得分显著的高于长跑选手,则可以某程度的证明此测验的确测量到无氧运动能力。","If the sprinters and jumpers score significantly better than the distance runners do, this finding would provide some evidence that the test measures anaerobic power."
7993,我们以基本概念做为我们所要涵盖介绍的铳计方法之开端，例如测量集中趋势、变异性和常态分布等。,"We began our coverage of statistical techniques with basic concepts such as measures of central tendency, variability, and normal distribution."
7993,请记得统计分析能做的两件事：建立显著性以及评估其意义。,Remember that statistics can do two things: establish significance and assess meaningfulness.
7993,显著性是指一个关联或差异是可信的一当同一研究被重复执待时，你可以预期同样的关联或差异再次发生。,Significance means that a relationship or difference is reliable— that you could expect it to happen again if the study were repeated.
7993,而意义性则是关于结果的重要性。,Meaningfulness refers to the importance of the results.
7994,我们大多知道阴茎和阴道的关系——阴茎是停在阴道车库里的汽车。,Most of us know the relationship between the penis and vagina—the penis is the car that parks in the vaginal garage.
7994,然而汽车一旦在车道上熄火，你是没法把它开到车库里的；如果车库大门紧闭，也一样毫无办法开进去。,"But if the car breaks down in the driveway, you can't pull it into the garage.Ditto if the garage door is jammed shut."
7994,我们需要圆满实现两性结合的力量，就男性和女性而言（尤其是男性），没有高质量的血流状况，一切都是空谈。当然魅力是实现这一目标的第一步。,"You need power to consummate the relationship.In the case of both men and women (especially men), nothing works without high-quality blood flow, and that starts with attraction."
7995,这些变化是为了让子宮一次次地做好卵子与精子结合的准备。子宫通过收缩，脱去多余的子宮组织，雌性激素和孕激素共同控制调节这个过程，这就是月经。,"Those changes direct the process that prepares the uterus for the next circle, when an egg will be available, bu sloughing excess uterine tissue through contrations of the uterus."
7995,它会引起阴道流血和人体激素含量的变化，影响女性处理生活压力的态度。,"That's the process of menstruation, which causes vaginal bleeding, as well as harmonal changes that affect the way women deal with life and stress."
7996,子宫或阴道异常一般是畸形综合征的一个部分，包括骨骼和肾脏系统的异常——罗-库-豪综合征最为常见的。,Often uterus or vaginal anomalies are part of a syndrome of malformations including abnormalities of the skeletal and renal systems——the Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome is the most common.
7996,最简单的障碍是无孔处女膜阻止子宫黏液和内膜血液的流出。,"The simplest single disorder is that of the imperforate hymen, which does not permit the outward passage of uterine mucous and endometrial blood."
7996,这些液体积聚造成阴道积水或阴道子宫积水  并使处女膜膨出和（或）引起每月发作的腹部疼痛。,These accumulate in the vagina (hydrocolpos) or uterus (hydrometro-colpos) and produce a bulging hymen; and/or one may elicit a vague history of abdominal pain that may have monthly excerbations.
7997,我们大多知道阴茎和阴道的关系——阴茎是停在阴道车库的汽车。,Most of us know the relationship between the penis and vagina—the penis is the car that parks in the vaginal garage.
7997,然而汽车一旦在车道上熄火，你是没法把它开到车库里的;如果车库大门紧闭，也一样毫无办法开进去。,"But if the car breaks down in the driveway, you can't pull it into the garage.Ditto if the garage door is jammed shut."
7997,我们需要圆满实现两性结合的力量，就男性和女性而言（尤其是男性），没有高质量的血流状况，一切都是空谈。当然魅力是实现这一目标的第一步。,"You need power to consummate the relationship.In the case of both men and women (especially men), nothing works without high-quality blood flow, and that starts with attraction."
7998,不管你对自重训练的看法如何，有一点毋庸置疑，那就是引体向上很酷。,"No matter what your opinion of bodyweight training, there’s no denying it—pullups are cool."
7998,谁看到《洛奇2》里史泰龙在攀缘架上咬紧牙关练习偏重引体向上时不会热血沸腾呢？,"Who wasn’t inspired watching Sylvester Stallone, jaw clenched, performing uneven pullups from that climbing frame in Rocky II?"
7998,也许我个人更喜欢《终结者2》里的一幕——干练的琳达·汉密尔顿（Linda·Hamilton）在立起的铁床上做了一个引体向上。,Perhaps my personal favorite example from the movies was the sight of a very lean and mean Linda Hamilton cranking out pullups from the legs of her upturned metal bunk in Terminator 2.
7998,我还记得，我刚进监狱不久时，看见一个头发花白的黑人囚徒在囚室门上做单臂引体向上，我发誓也要学会这个看似不可思议的动作。,"I can remember, years back when I was new to prison, seeing a grey-haired black veteran inmate doing one-arm pullups from the door of his cell, and vowing that one day I would learn how perform such a seemingly impossible technique."
7999,印度摔跤手练习这个动作已有数百年的历史。,This is an exercise used by Indian wrestlers for centuries.
7999,双腿分开，与肩同宽或略宽。下蹲，成蹲坐姿势，下蹲过程中抬起脚跟。,"With your feet shoulder width apart or a little wider, drop down onto your haunches, raising your heels as you do so."
7999,到最低点后，不要停顿，立即靠腿部发力，将自己推起，与此同时脚跟放下。,"Immediately—with no pause—push yourself back up using leg power, rocking back on your heels as you go."
7999,随着脚跟抬起和放下，身体重心会上下前后地移动，这种踩跷跷板一样的节奏使得该动作的速度和爆发力比普通深蹲中的大。,"This rocking movement back and forwards on the heels generates a kind of see-saw type rhythm as your center of gravity shifts forwards and back, up and down.This rhythm in turn encourages greater speed, greater explosiveness than in usual squats."
7999,与一般深蹲不同，弹震式动作其实是印度深蹲的核心。,"Unlike regular squats, this ballistic performance is actually a core element of Hindu squats."
7999,在印度深蹲过程中，随着动作轻轻挥动手臂，有助于产生和保持节奏。,Finding a way to gently swing your arms in tune with the movement will help cultivate and maintain the rhythm.
7999,在该动作最高点和最低点都不要暂停——你需要连续做动作。,"Don’t pause at the bottom or the top, you need constant movement."
8000,第二种需引起注意的青少年运动员足部应力性骨折是第五跖骨部基底骨折。,The second site of difficult stress fracture in the foot in young athletes is that of the base of the 5th metatarsal.
8000,同样，此类骨折也通常是在其完全发生后才能作出诊断。,"Once again, these stressfractures are often detected late after they have become fully established."
8000,此骨折也不易愈合，有时需要在第5跖骨近1 / 3处内固定才能获较好的愈合效果。青少年运动员长期训练而容易发生的应力性骨折的部位包括第二跖骨近端，以及较为熟知的跖骨干骨折。,"This is a slow healing bone, sometimes requiring internal fixation to attain satisfactory union of the stress fractures in the proxim al third of the 5th metatarsal.Other special stress fractures have been encountered in young athletes undergoing repetitive training, including stress fractures of the proximal 2nd metatarsal, as well as the shaft of the metatarsal which is much better known."
8001,在约束踏车转速、确保车座和车把设置标准化的情况下，测试-再测试的可靠性会进一步提高。,The test-retest reliability will be enhanced by stipulation of pedalling rate and ensuring standardization in regard to seat and handlebar settings.
8001,表35.4列举 了在一些研究中的可靠性和推荐的踏车频率。,Table 35.4 shows few studies that have reported reliability or recommended pedalling frequencies.
8001,对于跑台和功率车试验，确保10岁以下儿童的气阀和嘴罩的死腔小并不超出55ml就能提高有效性和可靠性。,"For both treadmill and cycle ergometer testing, validity and reliability will be enhanced by ensuring the dead space of the valve and mouthpiece is small and does not exceed 55ml for children under 10 years of age."
8002,在进行儿童有氧能力测试之前，必须先对“有氧功率”和“有氧能力”术语之间的区别有所了解。,"Prior to considering the different methods for measuring aerobic performance in children, a distinction should be made between the terms 'aerobic power' and 'aerobic capacity'."
8002,有氧功率是指以氧化代谢过程为主产生能量的最大速率。,Aerobic power refers to the maximal rate at which energy can be produced by predominantly oxidative processes.
8002,因此，最大有氧功率是单位时间内能够消耗的最大的氧气量（Thoden，1991)。,"Maximum aerobic power is, therefore, the maximum amount of oxygen that can be consumed per unit of time (Thoden, 1991)."
8003,心肺训练可以减脂，同时它还是用于提高有氧运动能力的最佳方法。有氧运动需要消耗氧气。,"While cardio training is most often associated with fat loss, it is also the best way to improve aerobic capacity, which is the ability to use oxygen to fuel exercise activity."
8003,在低中等强度的运动中，体能源自于氧气、碳水化合物基质和脂肪。,"During low- to moderate-intensity exercise, muscles rely on energy from a combination of oxygen and the substrates of carbohydrates and fats."
8003,运动量越大，消耗的氧气也越多。,"The more oxygen that can be consumed, the more physical work an individual will be able to do."
8004,鱼油和坚果能够有效减轻疼痛，对保持关节长期正常运作有效果。,Fish oil and nuts are a great way to reduce pain and to keep your joints functioning for the long term.
8004,通过体育锻炼使骨骼周围或连接骨骼的肌肉和关节紧张，能达到强健骨骼的目的。,You strengthen your bones by doing exercises that stress the muscles and joints that surround them or connect them.
8004,维生素D和钙质对两性同样重要。,Vitamin D and calcium are important as well for both men and women.
8005,在决定该使用哪个预测变项(或预测变项集)时，标准统计学程序包提供了数个选项。,"In deciding which predictors (or sets of predictors) to use, standard statistical packages offer several options."
8005,表8.3包含最常见的选择法。,Table 8.3 includes the most common procedures.
8005,其中一个选项是使用每一个预测变项；然而，如果能够用越少的变项来获得良好预测的话，那麽该预测方程式就越具效益且价值性。,"One option is simply to use all the predictor variables.But the fewer that can be used while still obtaining a good prediction, the more economical and valuable the prediction equation is."
8006,日常的体力活动是与一个人每天活动的数量有关，是以热量作为测量单位的。,"Habitual physical activity concerns the amount of movement an individual engages in on a daily basis, measured in terms of caloric output."
8006,而身体素质说明的是一个人在完成运动能力测试时的表现水平。,"Physical fitness, on the other hand, indicates how well one performs on motor tasks."
8006,其测量指标取决于涉及到的测试活动内容 (45m冲刺的时间，投掷垒球的距离，仰卧起坐的次数等）。,"Its measurement depends on the activity involved (time on a 45-m sprint, distance throwing a baseball, number of sit-ups, etc.)."
8006,"很可能二者对不同的 健康状况都是重要的（Rowland, 1990)。","Probably both are important to different health outcomes (Rowland, 1990)."
8006,预防肥胖显然是与热量的消耗（体力活动）有关。而慢性背部疾患可以通过加强肌肉张力和力量（身体素质）来治疗。,"Prevention of obesity is clearly related to caloric expenditure (physical activity), while chronic back disease might be forestalled by good muscle tone and strength (physical fitness)."
8007,体育学、肌动学、运动科学与竞赛科学已有数千篇的研究在探讨研究方法上会导致研究缺乏效度的错误。,"Physical education, kinesiology, exercise science, and sport science have produced thousands of studies in which the discussions centered on methodological faults that caused the research to lack validity."
8007,值得再提的是，对于不适当的结果，事后归咎于方法学，是不可被接受的。,It is worth repeating that placing post hoc blame on the methodology for inadequate results is unacceptable.
8007,每一个学位论文必须呈现预试实验(pilot work)，方能证明所有器材与步骤都能针对实验所预期的参与者类型产生作用。,Every thesis or dissertation proposal should present pilot work that verifies that all instruments and procedures will function as specified on the type of participants for which the research is intended.
8008,体育运动员受伤，大多会成为媒体报道的头条新闻。女性运动员前卜字韧带撕裂的几率是男性运动员的8倍。女性膝部的生理结构较男性松散，女性的骨骼也从整体上比男性脆弱，这就对稳定性造成了负面影响， 致使女性的韧带更易于撕裂。,"Athletes get all the headlines when they get injured, but women are up to eight times more likely than men to tear their ACL The looser construction of the female knee—ond overall weaker skeleton—can compromise stability and predispose women to ligament tears."
8008,韧带受伤还与月经前后的雌性激素含量变化有一定联系，因此在高中、大学、娱乐界和职业的运动员中，女性韧带撕裂的情况远远多于男性。,"The injuries are also linked to hormonal changes around the time of menstruation, so female high school, collegiate, recreational, and professional athletes end up suffering many more tears than men do."
8009,"毫无疑问，在已经来月经的妇女和动物模型中，过分限制食物的摄入量和过量的运动训练会影响促性腺释放激素（gonadotrophin-releasing hormone, GnRH)的脉冲性释放，从而进一步影响到促黄体生成激素（luteinizing hormone, LH)。",There is no doubt that suppressive food restriction and excessive exercise has an effect on the pulsatile release of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and hence on luteinizing hormone (LH) in postmenarcheal women and animal models.
8009,"相反，身体脂肪和促性腺释放激素脉冲发生源之间可能存在联系的假设看起来还不足以说明如此巨大的影响 (Bronson & Manning, 1991)。","In contrast, the potential links between body fat and the GnRH pulse generator that have been postulated so far seem too subtle to account for such robust effects (Bronson & M anning, 1991)."
8009,"因而，虽然女运动员比非运动员月经初潮发生得晚，但是运动训练“延缓”月经初潮产生的看 法仍然有待证实（Loucks oZ., 1992)。","Thus, although menarche occurs later in female athletes than in nonathletes, it has yet to be shown that training 'delays' menarche in anyone (Loucks et al.,19 9 2 )."
8010,运动残疾是很难加以界定的，因为许多先天的和后天的损害都应该包含在内。,Motor disability is a difficult construct to define since many congenital and acquired impairments should be included.
8010,此外，定义还必须包括急性和慢性的残疾。,"In addition, the definition must include disabilities that are classified as acute or chronic."
8010,本章讨论的是一系列的永久性残疾，它们如何影响儿童的运动能力以及残障儿童在什么水平上能够胜任运动。,"It is the purpose of this discussion to examine a series of perm anent disabilities, how they affect a child's abilities to perform and the level at which he or she may perform in a sport environment."
8010,因此，在本章中，我们将运动残疾视为因先天因素、慢性退行性疾病或创伤引起的运动能暂时性或永久性的减弱。,"Hence, for the purpose of this chapter, we will consider a motor disability as temporary or permanent decrements in physical performance, motor capabilities and/or potential due to congenital factors, chronic degenerative disease or traumatic injury."
8011,但是，再一次说明，生物发展的节奏并不与年代顺序时间密切配合。生物钟主要受遗传因素影响。,"But, once again, the tempo of biological development is not closely attuned to chronological time.Here, the biological clock is set largely by genetic factors."
8011,在儿童时期，这个过程的发展速度个体间会有非常巨大的差异。,The rate of this process during the course of the childhood years can vary dramatically among children.
8011,因此，在任何特定的实足年龄，你可以看到在身材、结构、生理功能、运动技能、个性，以及积极性等方面的巨大差异。,"Thus, at any given chronological age, you may witness wide differences in body size, composition, physiological function, motor skill, personality, and motivation."
8012,如果一天当中训练的生理反应的变化是有节奏的，那么选择这些时间去追踪会是有益的吗？,"If physiological responses to training vary rhythmically during the course of a day, would it be rewarding to select these times to head to the track?"
8012,如果教练认为高的划水频率在一个特定的游泳比赛中会更好，运动员就应该这样做吗？,"If a coach thinks that a high stroke count leads to a better time in a particular swimming event, should the athlete go with it?"
8012,还是应该坚持直观感觉的更标准的节奏，即让大脑中的潜意识控制划水节奏？,Or is it better to stick to a cadence that feels intuitively more normal—one directed by a subconscious controller of stroke tempo in the brain?
8012,事先说明，这些问题的答案不是很明显。,Be forewarned that the answers to such questions are not obvious.
8012,或许这就是让体育如此辉煌的部分原因吧。,Perhaps that is part of what makes sports so glorious.
8012,精确的身体运动控制器、运动员的经验和决策，所有的一切混杂在一起来决定运动员的成功。,The wisdom of the body’s motor controllers that tick to an intrinsic clock.The athlete’s experience and decision making.All of this coming together in a fascinating mélange that dictates athletic success.
8013,这种选择有可能是由运动员本人、家长、教练员、有影响的其他人或由这些人共同决定的。,"The selection may be made by the individual, parents, coach, influential others or some combination of these."
8013,而且，提早发育本身就与生长有关，而二者又都与运动能力联系着的。,"Further, earlier maturation is intrinsically related to growth in size and both are associated with performance."
8013,最后，运动能力不仅受到生物本性的影响，还受很多其他因素的影响。,"Finally, athletic performance is influenced by many factors other than those of a biological nature."
8014,有时，为了追求运动能力而忽视健康的营养。,"Sometimes, healthy nutritional practices are disregarded in the pursuit of athletic prowess."
8014,人们的重点是放在将儿童培养成好运动员，而不是将他（她）培养成为快乐的、健康的人。,"The emphasis may be on what will make the child a better athlete, rather than what will make him or her a happy, healthy human being."
8014,这种情况的部分原因可能是因为家长和教练员没有充分了解儿童发育成熟的阶段、营养需求、情绪和身体能力的信息。,"This may be in part because parents and coaches are not well informed about the child's stage of maturation, nutritional needs, emotions and/or physical ability."
8015,呼吸道的热量丢失和空气过冷是运动性支气管痉挛的机制之一。,One of the mechanisms which explainexercise-induced bronchoconstriction involves respiratory heat loss and airway cooling.
8015,"当吸入空气是冷的时候，在儿童和成年人中发生支气管痉挛的机会就增加（Strauss et al., 1977）。","When the inspired air is cold, there is an increase in its prevalence among children and adults (Strauss et al., 1977)."
8015,因此，在冷环境中运动时应该尽可能用鼻子呼吸。,"Thus, it is recommended when possible to breathe through the nose during exercise in the cold."
8016,"如果选择重复量数ANOVA(在我们看来,是最好的选择），请密切注意我们在第9章对于重复量数单因子与多因子议题的讨论。","If you choose a repeated-measures ANOVA for this design (in our opinion, the best choice), pay close attention to our discussion of univariate and multivariate issues in repeated measures in chapter 9."
8016,另一个选择是简单ANCOVA，使用各组的前测数据(01与03)来调整后测数据（02与04)，要记得有些问题牵涉到使用前测作为共变量（请参阅第9章有关ANCOVA的讨论）。,"Another choice is simple ANCOVA, using the pretest for each group (Ol and 03) to adjust the posttest (02 and 04).Recall that some problems are associated with using the pretest as a covariate (see the discussion of ANCOVA in chapter 9)."
8016,最后，实验者可以将每位研究对象的后测值减去前测值(称为差异分数，difference score或增加的分数，gain score)，然后进行简单ANOVA (或是只有两组的时候，使用独立样本，考验），将每位研究对象的差异分数作为自变项。,"Finally, the experimenter could subtract each participant’s pretest value from the posttest value (called a difference, or gain score) and perform a simple ANOVA (or, with only two groups, an independent t test), using each participant’s difference score as the dependent variable."
8016,这些技术都有各自的优点和缺点，但读者在文献中会看到三种都被使用过。,"Each of these techniques has strengths and weaknesses, but you will find all three used in the literature."
8017,找一面墙，双手手掌平放在距离墙根约15到25厘米的地面上，但双手（尤其是两个食指）要互相接触。,Locate a solid wall and place your hands on the ground six to ten inches out from it.Your hands—specifically the index fingers—should be touching.
8017,蹬起成倒立姿势，双臂伸直，脚跟与墙壁接触，身体微微弯曲。,Kick up into a handstand with straight arms and a lightly curved body tapering back to where the heels make contact with the wall.
8017,这是窄距倒立撑的起始姿势（图117）。,This is the start position of the close handstand pushup (fig. 117).
8018,在窄距深蹲过程中，直立，双脚脚跟相碰，脚尖微微向外，双臂前伸。,"In the close squats, stand up straight with your heels together, toes angled out very slightly.Your arms should be straight out in front of your chest."
8018,弯曲膝盖和髋部，直到大腿后侧紧贴小腿，无法蹲得更低为止。,Bend at the knees and hips until your hamstrings are resting on your calves and you can go no further.
8018,此时，你的胸部应该紧贴大腿。,Your chest will be pressed into your thighs .
8018,注意，脚跟始终不要抬离地面。,Do not raise the heels.
8018,为避免后倾，你得收缩胫骨肌肉使身体微微前倾。,"To prevent yourself from tipping backwards, you may have to flex your shins to pull your toes up so that you ease forwards."
8018,保持这一姿势，然后仅靠腿部发力将自己推回到起始姿势。,Return to the start position using leg power only.
8019,向上跳起抓住横杆，采用正握姿势，双手尽量挨在一起——如果距离太近关节会感到不适，但最宽也不要超过10厘米。,"Jump up and grab a bar with an overhand grip.Your hands should be next to each other—fourinches apart at the maximum, if a very close grip irritates your joints."
8019,双膝弯曲，双脚脚踝交叠在一起并置于身后，以免腿部借力。,Bend at the knees with your ankles looped behind your vertical plane to keep them out of the motion.
8019,肘部微微弯曲，双肩收紧。,Kink the elbows very slightly and keep your shoulders tight.
8019,弯曲肘部，夹起肩部，平缓地将自己拉起来，直到下巴高过横杆。,"Bend at the elbows and shoulders to raise your body, slowly levering yourself up until your chin passes the bar."
8019,暂停一下，然后再慢慢放低身体，回到起始姿势。,"Pause for a count of one, before slowly lowering yourself back down to the start position."
8019,暂停，然后再重复。,Pause and repeat.
8019,整个窄距引体向上过程中，腿部尽量保持不动。,"In the process of the close pullups, try to minimize leg movement during the set."
8020,胶原蛋白在骨骼内是被矿物化成很有秩序的两种类型的组织：骨皮质成分(cortical component)和骨小梁成分(trabucular component)。,The collagen in bone is m ineralized in an ordered fashion to form two types of skeletal tissue: cortical and trabecular.
8020,骨皮质是致密的组织，形成所有骨骼的外表和长骨的轴心。,The cortical component is the densely' compacted tissue forming the outer surface of all bones and the shafts of the long bones.
8020,在椎体、小骨和长骨的骨骺端，骨小梁在骨皮质内形成很薄的骨性小盘的网络或架子。,"The trabecular component forms a mesh work of thin, bony plates or scaffolding found inside the cortical shell in the vertebral bodies, the small bones and the metaphyses of long bones."
8021,本章利用英国媒体报道来理解“ 吐血门” 是如何发生的，又是如何被话语框架建构的，那些参与者以及目睹丑闻被层层揭露的其他人的反应如何。,"This chapter uses British media reports to understand how Bloodgate could have occurred, was discursively framed, and was reacted to by those involved and others watching the scandal unfold."
8021,"利用《文明的历程》( Civilimg Process)和《掌控羞耻感》(Master Emotion of Shame) 中的过程概念(E lia s, 1978 ； Kilminster, 2 0 0 7 ) ，本章论证了媒体如何认定“ 吐血门” 的罪魁祸首是现代职业英式橄榄球的气质而不是某一个具体的个人本身。","Using figurational notions of the civilimg process and the master emotion of shame (Elias, 1978; Kilminster, 2007), the chapter demonstrates how the media identified the main culprit in the Bloodgate scandal as being the ethos of modern professional rugby rather than any specific individual per se."
8021,本章同时也考量了英式橄榄球联盟的结构价值和侧重点迈向一种制度化欺骗和腐败的文化形态的历史变迁。,It also considers the historical shift in the value structures and emphases of rugby union towards a cultural form conducive to institutionalized cheating and corruption.
8022,脚趾平放在地面上，弯腰，双手撑在身体前方的地面上，此时臀部大约成直角。,"With your toes flat on the floor, place your palms on the ground at some point in front of you so that you are bent approximately ninety degrees at the hips."
8022,（这个变式被称为折刀俯卧撑，就是因为训练者的身体看上去像一把打开的小折刀。,"(This angle is called the jackknife pushup, because your body resembles an opening pocket knife.)"
8022,）双手大约与肩同宽，上半身挺直，膝关节微微弯曲。,"Your hands should be about shoulder width apart, and despite the angle at the hips, your torso should be straight."
8022,弯曲手臂，肩部下沉，放低身体，直到下巴轻触双手之间的地面。,"Retain a gentle bend at the knee.Bending at the arms and shoulders, lower your chin until it kisses the floor at a point between your hands."
8022,然后，髋部慢慢下降划过地面，下巴继续向前划出一条弧线，直到双臂和双腿伸直，此时肩部高于髋部。,"Now continue moving your chin in an upwards arc, as your hips drop to brush the ground.You should finish the movement with your arms and legs straight, your shoulders high and your hips low."
8022,双臂保持伸直的状态，臀部向后撅起回到起始姿势，重复练习。,"Keeping your arms straight, push your butt out and back until you are in the starting position again,and repeat."
8022,尽管这个变式中的弯曲和伸展动作可以练出强大、柔韧的髋部，但对上身肌肉来说，该练习比标准俯卧撑更容易。,"This exercise is easier on the upper body muscles than regular pushups, although the jackknife bending and straightening motion builds strong, flexible hips."
8022,因此，它在武术家和摔跤运动员中十分流行。,"For this reason, the exercise is popular with martial artists and wrestlers."
8022,该练习有时也被称为猫式俯卧撑。,Sometimes this exercise is known as a cat pushup.
8023,站在一个稳固的物体前，此物体的高度大约与你的膝盖等高，至少也要达到胫骨上部，小咖啡桌、椅子、床铺都是不错的选择。,"Stand in front of a sturdy object which comes up to your knees, or at least the tops of your shins.A small coffee table, chair or a bunk are good choices."
8023,双腿分开，与肩同宽或略宽。,"Your legs should be shoulder width apart, or a little wider."
8023,双腿伸直，弯腰俯身，直到双手与面前的物体接触。,"Keeping your legs fairly straight, bend at your hips until your palms are in contact with the object."
8023,身体前倾，使一部分体重落在双手上。,Tilt forwards slightly so that you can take some of your body’s weight through your hands.
8023,上半身尽量与地面平行，弯曲膝关节和髋部，直到大腿后侧紧贴小腿，无法蹲得更低为止。,"Now, with your torso remaining as parallel to the floor as possible, bend at the knees and hips until your hamstrings reach your calves and you cannot go any further."
8023,下蹲过程中你还需要弯曲双臂，在下降到最低点后腿部与手臂要同时发力，将身体推回到起始姿势。,"This will require that you bend your arms, also.Using combined leg and arm power, push yourself up to the start position."
8023,在整个折刀深蹲过程中，脚跟始终不能抬离地面。,Do not raise the heels at any point during the jackknife squat.
8024,换句话说，如果测量没有一致性——如果连续的测验不能得到相同的结果——那么这个测验就不可信赖。,"In other words, if the test is not consistent—if you cannot depend on successive trials to yield the same results—then the test cannot be trusted."
8024,当然，测验有可能有信度却没有效度，但绝不可能有效度而没有信度。,"Of course, scores from a test can be reliable yet not valid, but it can never be valid if it is not reliable."
8024,例如，以一台损坏的体重器重复测量你的体重，就可能得到有信度却没有效度的结果。,"For example, weighing yourself repeatedly on a broken scale would give reliable results but not valid ones."
8024,测验信度在讨论时会以观察分数(observedscore)、眞实分数(truescore)、及误差分数（errorscore)这些名词来进行。,"Test reliability is sometimes discussed in terms of observed score, true score, and error score."
8025,在实验类的研究中，我们会在样本中进行分组。,"In experimental research, groups are formed within the sample."
8025,这里所处理的问题并不是如何选取样本，而是如何在样本中形成不同组别。,The issue here is not how the sample is selected but how the groups are formed within the sample.
8025,在第十八章中，我们将讨论实验类型研究和真实验设计。,Chapter 18 discusses experimental research and true experimental designs.
8025,所有的真实验设计都要求样本中的组别是随机分派的。,All true designs require that the groups within the sample be randomly assigned or randomized.
8025,尽管这个必要条件与选取样本无关，但进行随机分派的程序是相同的。,"Although this requirement has nothing to do with selecting the sample, the procedures used for random assignment are the same."
8026,室上性心动过速是阵发性房性心动过速。,Supraventricular tachycardia is also known as paroxysmal atrial tachycardia.
8026,室上性心动过速是心房的冲动异常快速地向心室传导的结果。,This dysrhythmia results from an abnormally rapid conduction of an atrial impulse into the ventricle.
8026,室上性心动过速是短暂的和阵发的。,Supraventricular tachycardia is typically episodic and occurs in paroxysms.
8027,关于振荡器神经元的发射速度。,The following is about the firing rate of the pacemaker neuron.
8027,CPG的主要作用是无意识地、自动地、精确地激活中枢神经系统中的单个神经纤维。,"You will remember that the principal actor in the CPG is the spontaneous, automatic, regular-like-clockwork electrical firing of single nerve cells within the central nervous system."
8027,这些神经元的自动化，是通过电解质（钠、钾、钙）移动穿过细胞膜发生的。,"The automaticity of these neurons occurs from movement of electrolytes (sodium, potassium, calcium) across the cell membrane."
8027,尽管，像心脏的窦房结起搏器一样，这些神经元具有一种内在的发射频率，但自动发射频率（和因此产生的脉冲频率）显然受许多外部因素的影响。,"Although, like the sinus node pacemaker of the heart, these neurons possess an intrinsic firing the rate of spontaneous firing (and therefore the rate of impulse generation) is clearly influenced by a number of external factors."
8028,人体测量中，质量是“精确性”和 “正确度”的专业术语。,"In anthropometry, quality is a generic term for 'precision' and 'accuracy'."
8028,二者并非同义语。,The terms are not synonymous.
8028,正确度（accuracy)是从真实对象所获取的测量结果，是正确的或符合实际的。,Accuracy is the exactness or conformity of an obtained measure to the true score.
8028,"精确度（precision)是指数据的一致性(consistency),可以通过简单的重复测试过程来检验。",Precision is the consistency of data that can be determined by a simple replication procedure.
8029,直立，双脚分开，与肩同宽或略宽。,"Stand up straight with the feet shoulder width apart, or slightly wider."
8029,手臂向斜下方伸出，双手放在比自己的大腿略高的稳固物体上，书桌、高脚凳或椅背都可以。弯曲髋部与膝关节，身体慢慢下降，背部尽可能保持挺直，直到大腿后侧紧贴小腿，无法蹲得更低为止。,"Your arms should be out straight and angled down, holding onto a sturdy object higher than your thighs.A desk, robust basin or the back of a chair will do.Slowly lower yourself down by bending at the hips and the knees, keeping your back as straight as possible, until your hamstrings meet your calves and you cannot descend any further."
8029,暂停一会，然后主要靠腿部发力站起来。为了分担双腿的一部分压力，尤其是在最低点时，你要通过向下按压面前的物体，来借用手臂的一部分力量。,"Pause for a moment, before pushing yourself up using mostly leg power.To take some of the pressure off your legs—particularly in the bottom position—pull yourself up slightly with your arms, by exerting downward force on the object you are holding."
8029,手臂要尽量伸直，在整个支撑深蹲过程中都不要让脚跟抬离地面。,Try to keep the arms fairly straight.Your heels should remain flat on the floor throughout the supported squat.
8030,证据显示，那些已经在音乐上取得成功的人，其神经肌肉系统的运行与你我不同。,Evidence indicates that the neuromuscular systems of those who have achieved musical success operate differently than yours and mine.
8030,令人惊奇的是，在实验室测试中，技艺熟练的钢琴家比普通人似乎拥有更优越的运动和知觉的时机掌控能力。,"To no one’s surprise, skillful pianists are seen to possess motor and perceptual timing in laboratory testing that is superior to nonpianists."
8030,音乐家也比普通人在时间估算方面更精确。,Musicians are also more accurate than nonmusicians in estimating time.
8030,但是，同时这些有才能的人在练习上比你我投人了更多的时间。,"But, then again, these talented people put in a lot more hours of practice than you or I do."
8031,其次，如果腰部有赘肉，会更加危险，因为腹部脂肪 的脂肪细胞会分泌一种激素，直接增加血管发炎的几率。即使只减去5%的体重，也能显著提高人体综合健康素质，改善心血管健康状况。,"Second, that extra weight that's carried around your waist places you at an even higher risk, because the fat cells in abdominal fat secrete a hormone that directly increases inflammation in your blood vessels* A weight loss of even 5 percent of body weight will significantly improve your overall and cardiovascular health."
8031,运动的另一个作用是缓解紧张，而紧张压力是人体衰老的重大原因之一。,"Another way exercise can help you is by reducing stress, which is one of the greatest agers of your body."
8032,坐在地上，双腿伸直，双脚与肩同宽。,"Sit on the ground with your legs stretched out in front of you.Your knees should be straight, with your feet about shoulder width apart."
8032,手掌平放在髋部两侧的地上，手指朝前。,"Place your palms on the floor on either side of your hips, with your fingers pointing towards your toes.Sit up straight."
8032,坐直，此时腿和上半身之间的夹角成90°。,"Your body will now form a right angle, with your trunk perpendicular to your legs."
8032,这是该直桥的起始姿势（图85）。,This is the start position of the straight bridge (fig. 85).
8032,双手用力下压，双臂绷紧，同时将髋部向上推起，直到双腿与躯干成一条直线。,"Press down through the hands, tensing the arms as you simultaneously push your hips upwards until your legs and torso form a straight line."
8032,下巴向上抬起，看向天花板，此时只用手掌和脚跟支撑身体。,Draw the chin up and look towards the ceiling.At this point your bodyweight will be passing through your palms and heels.
8032,这是结束姿势（图86）。,This is the finish position (fig. 86).
8032,暂停一会，然后反向运动。,Pause before reversing the motion and repeating as necessary.
8032,身体撑起时呼气，身体放低时吸气。,"Exhale as you press yourself up, inhale as you go down."
8033,当下，媒体总是用情怀去描述早期体育事业的发展和体育文化，强调诸如公平竞争、内在报酬、性格培养(如体育精神、自律他律和领袖能力)以及高水准的自控能力等价值观念，谈及早期体育事业中的运动业余主义，往往会带上一种怀旧甚至忧郁的论调。,"Today, the era of athletic amateurism in sports is often viewed in a nostalgic (even melancholic) fashion, with the media describing earlier sports phases and cultures in romantic ways concerning values such as fair play, playing the sport for intrinsic rewards, the cultivation of positive character traits in players (such as sportspersonship, discipline, and leadership), and players possessing high levels of self-control."
8033,这样一种业余主义情怀尽管带有刻板印象的色彩，与当今的职业化时代与形象却形成了鲜明对比。当下，欲望、胜利第一、公平竞争第二的态度占据了主导地位。,"Such an amateur ethos, however stereotypical, contrasts starkly with the current era, and image, of professionalization—where greed, disregard for fair play, and an attitude of winning above all else predominate."
8034,为了参加比赛，摔跤选手必须符合某一体重级别的要求。,Scholastic wrestlers must meet a certain weight classification in order to compete.
8034,"通常的做法是在整个赛季摔跤选手都限制食物和液体的摄取量，以便参加低于其正常体重以下的1到3个级别的比赛（Steen & Brownell, 1990)。摔跤选手一般都相信这种被称为“制造体重”的方法，使他们在同比自己体重轻的对手比赛时有竞争优势。","It is a common practice throughout the competitive season for wrestlers to restrict food and fluid intake in order to compete at one to three weight classes below their normal weight (Steen & Brownell,1990).Wrestlers typically believe that this practice, known as 'making weight', gives them a competitive edge over smaller opponents."
8034,只有很少的摔跤选手、教练员和家长了解这种方法可能对身体产生不良的生理影响。,"Fewwrestlers, coaches and parents realize the negative physiological impact this practice may have on their bodies."
8035,我们也以较哲学性的讨论科学与求知的方法，提出从事研究的另类方式。,We also present alternative approaches for doing research relative to a more philosophical discussion of science and ways of knowing.
8035,尤其是，我们探讨使用质性研究、实地研究，与以内省的方法做为回答研究问题的策略。而非依赖传统的科学典范架构做为研究问题探讨的唯一方法。,"In particular, we address qualitative research, the use of field studies, and methods of introspection as strategies for answering research questions instead of relying on the traditional scientific paradigm as the only approach to research problems."
8036,运动心理学和体育教育文献中经常强调智力在体育运动中的重要性。,The importance of intelligence in sports activity is often emphasized in the literature of sport psychology and physical education.
8036,参与体育运动除体力外对智力也有要求。,"In addition to the physical strain, participation in sport also demands intellectual effort."
8036,为了学会如何正确使用运动技能，参加运动的孩子需要了解这些动作的组成，了解使用技巧的条件，分析和评价动作的结果并根据具体情况调整动作。,"To learn to use motor skills appropriately, the athlete needs to understand their structure and the situations in which they have to be utilized, to analyse and evaluate the movement execution and to adapt it to the requirements of the situation."
8037,很少有人对运动员的智力特征剖面图进行过研究。,Intelligence profiles of athletes are rarely studied.
8037,"杰龙（1979)和莱文（Levin, 1981，1984)曾尝试用Meili智力测量表 (Analytischer Intelligenztest)来构建儿童运 动员的智力剖面图。","Geron (1979) and Levin (1981, 1984) attempted to construct intelligence profiles of child athletes using the Meili's intelligence test — the Analytischer Intelligenztest (1971)."
8037,这一关系图后来发展成职业选择的一项方法，它包括6个子测验，其中5个是非言语测验。,"This test was developed as an instrument for vocational selection.It includes six subtests, five of which are non-verbal."
8038,在准备撰写本章时，我们总共阅读了48篇文章，但其中大多数被除外了。,"In the preparation of this chapter a total of 48 published studies were reviewed, but for various reasons most of them were excluded from the set of papers on which conclusions were based."
8038,有些被排除的研究文章是没有采用对照组，即没有考虑前面提到的生长发育的重要作用的影响，这是一个特别重大的缺陷。,"Some of the excluded studies were limited by the failure to employ a control group — given the afore-mentioned importance of growth and development, this is a particularly critical limitation."
8038,其他被排除的研究报告是因为训练负荷不能精确定量。,Other studies were excluded because the dose of training was not precisely quantified or described.
8038,带有这种缺陷的论文采用参与体育运动或体育课作为运动介入的内容。,Many of the studies that carried this limitation used either sport participation or physical education classes as the exercise treatment.
8038,再有一些被除外的研究论文是因其使用了特殊的人群作为研究的对象（如高血压、哮喘或智力障碍的儿童）。,"Some other studies were excluded because they used special populations of subjects (e.g.children with hypertension, asthma or mental handicap)."
8039,内层还能对中层起到保护作用。中层称为中膜，负责支撑动脉的整体结构。,"This inner lining also helps protect the middle layer, called the media layer, which supports the structure of the artery."
8039,中膜是肌肉层，因此它能对腕或身体其他部分发生的某些事作出反应。中膜在人紧张焦虑的时候会痉挛，运动时则会张开，让更多血流通过，为局部肌肉供能。,"The media is muscular, so it can respond to what's going on in your head or somewhere else in your body: it spasms when you are depressed or anxious, and opens up when you exercise to allow more blood through to supply the individual muscles."
8040,早发育和晚发育孩子之间在身高、体重和身体成分上的差异归结到一起就是体格方面的差异。,"Differences in stature, weight and body composition between early and late maturing children can be translated into physique differences."
8040,男孩的内胚层 (endomorphs)发育早，而外胚层 (extomorphs)发育晚。,"In boys, endomorphs tend to be early maturers while ectomorphs tend to be late maturers."
8040,男孩骨龄和身体成分之间的相关性证实了这种趋势，并且也说明中胚层（mesomorphy)与提早发育也有关系（图1.4)。,Correlations between skeletal age and somatotype components in boys confirm this trend and suggest that mesomorphy is also associated with early maturation (Fig. 1.4).
8040,然而，也有些对中胚层体形者的研究结果不大一致，虽然在15~ 18岁男孩中，年龄比较小就出现最大身高生长速度的孩子的中胚层比例较高。,"However, results are not consistent for mesomorphy, although boys with an early age at PHV have higher mesomorphy ratings from 15 to 18 years of age (Beunen et al., 1987)."
8041,在《运动员的时钟》这本书中，Rowland要展现的不是一个自大的作者。,"In The Athlete’s Clock, Rowland plots the assassination not of an autocratic emperor."
8041,相反， 他启发我们去质疑一些人类运动最神圣的概念。,"Instead, he invites us to question some of our most hallowed concepts of human athleticism."
8041,"他希望了解，运动科学领域的研究可 以如何帮助我们更好地理解时间、衰老和体内的生物钟以及相关的控制机制，如中枢模式发生器（ttie central pattern generator, CPG)如何影响人体的运动表现。","He wishes to understand how research in sport science helps us better understand how time, aging, our internal biological clocks, and associated controls like the central pattern generator (CPG) influence human athletic performance."
8042,第一，降低中枢指令，大脑信号沿着脊髓传递到收缩肌，控制肌肉收缩强度。,"First, it reduces central command, the signals descending down the spinal cord from the brain to the contracting muscle that control strength of contractions."
8042,第二，创造出一种熟悉的痛苦感觉，我们称之为疲劳（fatigue)，大多数人都无法忍受这种感觉，而再做出进一步的努力。,"And, second, it creates that familiar set of agonizing feelings we call fatigue, which for most of us makes further effort intolerable."
8042,第二种方式中，这种感觉是由中枢神经系统创建的一种症状，而不是一种生理或物理状态。,"In this way, such feelings are a symptom created by a guardian central nervous system, rather than a physiological or physical state."
8043,中位数（median) 是指中间的那个值，也就是当所有数字按照大小排列时，顺序位于（n + l) / 2 的那一个值。,The median is defined as the value in the middle; the middle value is the value that occurs in the place (N+ 1) / 2 when the values are put in order.
8043,"在我们的例子中，将所有数字由最低排到最高一1,2,3,5,5,5,6,8,46— 接着找出从第一个数字起的第（9+1) /2 = 5个数字，得到中位数是5 ，是比较能代表整个数列的分数。","In our example, arrange the numbers from lowest to highest— 1, 2, 3, 5, 5, 5, 6, 8, 46—then count (9 + 1) / 2 = 5 places from the first score; the median is the value 5, which is a much more representative score."
8043,"当N 是奇数时，中间值就可能是小数，例如数字1,2,3,4的中位数是 2.5。","If N is an even number, the median value may be a decimal.For example, for scores 1, 2, 3, 4, the median is 2.5."
8044,我们的中央运动振荡器（central motor oscillator)是高度智能化的，例如，它为长跑运动员选择最佳的步频和步长组合，使其最节能、最优化。,"Our central motor oscillator is highly intelligent, able to select for the distance runner, for example, an optimal combination of stride frequency and stride length that is most energy efficient for optimizing performance."
8044,这个控制器，如果不受干扰，会相当的稳定。,"It’s a controller that, left unperturbed, is amazingly stable."
8044,最重要的是，它都没有引起我们的注意。,"And, best of all, it does this all without causing us to think about it."
8044,注意！,Caution!
8044,不要将中央运动振荡器和我们前面章节提到的中央控制器（central governor)混淆。,Don’t confuse this central motor oscillator with the alleged central governor we encountered in the previous chapter.
8045,在统计和数学运算中，有一部分比较容易理解的是关于分数的集中趋势（central tendency) 和变异性（variability)之计算。,Some of the more easily understood statistical and mathematical calculations are those that find the central tendency and variability of scores.
8045,当你有了一组分数，可以用一个数字来代表群体，这个数字通常就是平均数、中位数或众数。,"When you have a group of scores, one number may be used to represent the group.That number is generally the mean, median, or mode."
8045,这些词语都是用来表达集中趋势的方法。,These terms are ways of expressing central tendency.
8046,稳定性（stability)系数是以在不同期间的重测法来确定。,The coefficient of stability is determined by the test-retest method on separate days.
8046,这个方法经常用于体适能及动作表现的测量，但较少用于纸笔测验。,This method is used frequently with fitness and motor performance measures but less often with pencil-and-paper tests.
8046,这是对一致性最严格的检视，因为当两个测验在不同日期中执行时，与测量有关的误差会更为明显的。,This is one of the most severe tests of consistency because the errors associated with measurement are likely to be more pronounced when the two test administrations are separated by a day or more.
8047,随着时间的推移，运动员的重复运动表现也很有趣。,Athletes are also keenly interested in their repeated performances over time.
8047,他们的击球率，比赛记录，或射门命中率等方面都变得稳定下来。,"They become fixated on batting averages, fighting records, or field goal percentages."
8047,当重复运动表现异常差时，我们说运动员处在低迷状态。,"When repeated performances are unexpectedly poor, we talk about athletes being in a slump."
8047,NBA总决赛中，对战波特兰队，迈克尔•乔丹连续投中6个三分球，我们称之为手热。,"When Michael Jordan sinks six three-pointers in a row in the NBA finals against Portland, he’s on a hot streak."
8048,在回顾了有关危机应对和形象恢复的文献（Allen & Caillouet，1994；Benoit，1997) 之后，库姆斯提出了组织采取的四种“姿态”：否认、缩减、重建以及支持（Coombs，2007)。,"Reviewing scholarship in crisis response and image restoration (Allen & Caillouet, 1994; Benoit, 1997), Coombs (2007) proposed four ""postures"" taken by organizations: denial, diminishment, rebuilding, and bolstering."
8048,在这些姿态中，到底哪一个更易于应用到运动员个体上？十种策略便应运而生了。通过这些策略所告知的方法，运动员成功或是不成功地应对困境。,"Within these organizational postures, which one can readily apply to individual athletes, 10 strategies emerge, each of which informs the manner in which athletes may succeed or not succeed in responding to adversity."
8049,想象一下，有一条重心线从你的身体穿过直达地球的中心。,Think of the line of gravity as it flows downward through your skeleton toward the center of the earth.
8049,现在 再想想你跑步时身体的重心，并对比一下落地的方式。,"Now think about your center of gravity as you run, in comparison with where your foot is striking."
8049,如果你每一次落地脚都在重心线之前—— 也就是所说的“过大的跨步”—— 那么这就如同你每跑一步都在踩刹车。,If you reach out ahead of that line of gravity with each stride—known as “overstriding”—you are hitting the brakes with each step.
8049,这种落地方式是非常费劲的。,That’s a monumental waste of energy and momentum.
8049,根据极简跑和赤足跑拥护者们的观点，极简跑鞋和赤足跑可以纠正这种动作。,"Minimal shoes and barefoot running would, according to this school of thought, correct that."
8050,在他意识模糊的时候，他被抬回了地上，他的折磨终止了。他对在洞穴里发生的 事情的估计已经被严重扭曲。,"After he was dragged semiconscious to the surface when his ordeal  ended, his estimation of duration for events in the cavern had become wildly distorted."
8050,但是不仅没有变，反而实际上保存的相当稳定的是他的昼夜节律，周期性持续地的醒来和睡觉结合在一起，是在24h之内的。,"But what had not changed, and in fact had remained quite steady, was his nycthemeral rhythm, the periodic duration of  combined waking and sleeping periods within 24 hours."
8051,冠状动脉位于心脏表面，让血注入心肌。,"The coronary arteries, which lie on the heart's surface, drip blood into the heart muscle."
8051,通过与心肌相连的筋腱，二尖瓣控制血液正常流入左心室。,"With strings attached to that muscle, the mitral valve regulates blood into the left ventricle."
8051,如果筋腱过长，瓣膜位置会偏移得过远，以致血液回流入左心房。,"If those strings are too long, the volve leaflets slip too far up—allowing blood back into the left atrium."
8051,这种现象即二尖瓣功能不全。,That's a condition called mitral valve prolapse.
8051,这样主动脉瓣膜会拉扯收紧，因日久磨损而撕裂，造成合拢不严；或者正相反，瓣膜张开过小。,"Aortic valve leaflets can tighten and tear from wear and tear, causing leakage or, conversely, too narrow an opening."
8052,经过一段适应期后，你可以逐渐恢复食用牛奶或者黑豆，然后关注身体的反应，检査能量水平、肠胃反应、训练表现、睡眠质量等。,"After a period of adaptation, you can reintroduce a food such as milk or black beans and then pay attention to how your body reacts, monitoring energy levels, stomach comfort, performance in workouts, sleep quality, and the like."
8052,如果没有任何不良反应，那么这种食物就可以继续食用。,"If there’s no detrimental reaction, then the food gets a pass."
8052,类似的检测方法同样可以用来判断合适的食物量、每餐中主要营养素的比例和进餐时间等。,"The same sort of testing process would be employed to determine ideal quantities of the food, proportions of macronutrients in a meal, meal timing, and more."
8053,转体举腿是专门锻炼躯干两侧肌肉的终极动作，但只有在你足够强壮时才能尝试。,"Twisting Leg Raise is the ultimate specialist exercise for the flanks of the torso, but you need to be pretty strong to even attempt it."
8053,通过练习侧抬腿与举腿系列十式来增强你的力量。,"Build up to it with side leg raises, and by working your way through the regular leg raise series."
8053,抓住横杆，使身体悬垂，双腿伸直，然后举腿。,"Hang from a bar, and raise your legs."
8053,双腿举到最高处时，将一侧髋部转向前方，骨盆则尽量向高处扭转。,"They should be fairly straight.At the top of the movement, turn one hip out to the front and twist the pelvis up as high as you can."
8053,然后反向运动，接着重复练习另一侧。,Reverse the motion before repeating on the other side.
8053,这样一组动作，比1000组卷腹或转体更有效。,One set of this exercise—when you are up to it—will do more than a thousand sets of side crunches or broomstick twists.
8053,它能使你的腹外斜肌像手指一样突出，使你的转体动作更灵敏，让你拥有杰出的扭转力。,"It’ll make your obliques stand out like fingers, and improve all your athletic twisting motions, taking your torque strength to stellar levels."
8053,个中原因，就是该动作的强度极大。,"This is because it’s big, intense and painful."
8054,转体仰卧起坐其实就是普通的仰卧起坐，只不过训练者要在向上的过程中转体，让一侧的肘部接触另一侧的膝盖，每次反复都需变换转体方向。,"Twisting Sit-Up is the regular sit-up, but done with a twisting motion on the way up so that your elbow makes contact with the opposite knee, alternating the twisting direction with each repetition."
8054,很多健美运动员（以及拳击手——其实他们不该这么无知）都会练习转体仰卧起坐，以期强化腰部两侧的肌肉，即腹外斜肌。,"A lot of bodybuilders (and boxers—who should know better) do this exercise in the hope of strengthening the obliques, the muscles at the side of the waist."
8054,可是做仰卧起坐时，转动躯干所需的力量实在太小，因此该变式与普通仰卧起坐其实相差无几。,"Unfortunately there is very little force required to turn the torso during sit-ups, and as a result this variation adds little to the regular sit-up."
8054,苏联的训练者几十年前就深谙此道，所以发明了更有效的练习来锻炼腰部的扭转肌肉，这就是俄式转体。,Soviet trainers got wise to this fact decades ago and created a much more effective exercise for the twisting muscles of the waist; the Russian twist.
8055,大家经常提到的问题是为什么马拉松运动员在比赛中会“撞墙”。,The central question being asked is why a marathoner tends to hit the wall during a race.
8055,“ 撞墙”指的是大约在32千米时，跑者会感觉不能保持原来的配速，甚至不能继续跑步。,"Hitting the wall, or bonking, is when, somewhere around mile 20 in the race, a runner feels unable to maintain his or her pace, or even to continue at all."
8055,许多提倡LSD的教练认为，“撞墙” 的原因在于训练的跑量不够。,Many coaches who advocate LSD training believe the fault lies in the runner’s failure to log enough miles in training.
8055,"然而，研究指出，比赛中马拉松运动员调动的身体运动单位不到20%, 所以 “撞墙” 的原因并不是因为跑者没有建立好耐力基础。","However, research indicates that fewer than 20 percent of motor units are recruited in a marathoner’s legs at any time during competition, so it’s not a matter of the runner having failed to build an endurance base."
8055,运动生理学家最近提出了一项假设，“撞墙”的根本原因在于跑者不能在训练中完全调动这些神经连接。,"Instead, exercise physiologists now hypothesize that the source of the problem is the failure of the runner to more fully engage these neural connections during training."
8056,传媒重视坠落的体育英雄有很多原因。,There are many reasons why media treatment of the fallen sports hero is important.
8056,这些有关坠落的故事是多样的、有争议的和引人注目的。,"These stories are diverse, controversial, and compelling."
8056,"正如洛弗（Rowe, 1997, p. 203 ) 提到的，每个事件的情节都在“一个熟悉的、充满敬意的和愤怒的、庆贺的和中伤的、道德主义和虚无主义之间的小报线路径之中”。","As Rowe (1997, p. 203) noted, each case plots ""a familiar, tabloid-lined path between homage and outrage, celebration and vilification, moralism and nihilism."""
8057,如果想找到无氧训练的感觉的话，你可以试试用最快的速度冲刺跑。,"To get a feel for what an anaerobic workout is like, try sprinting at your top speed for as long as you can."
8057,大概1分钟以后，你就会上气不接下气，还能感觉到双腿和肺部的灼热。,"After a minute or so, you’ll be gasping for air and feeling burning in your legs and lungs."
8057,但是这种极限的强度不能保持很久。,There’s no keeping up such maximum intensity for long.
8057,在传统模式的耐力训练中，进行大量LSD训练是为速度训练和最终的比赛做准备。,"In the traditional model of endurance training, a heavy load of LSD running is recommended to prepare the body for speed work and eventually racing."
8057,我们在前言中讨论过，这个方法是根据特殊性原理制定的。,"This approach supposedly relies on the principle of specificity, discussed in the introduction."
8058,在出生时和出生第一周内能够被诱发出来的并能够正常消失的反射动作称为简单反射（primitive)。,Reflexes that can be elicited at birth or during the first weeks of life and normally disappear were often called primitive.
8058,有些姿势性反射（postural reflexes)也是在出生后的第一年里消失。,Some postural reflexes also disappear during the first year.
8058,"例如，不对称的张力性颈部反射（asymmetrical tonic neck reflex, ATNR)在出生后2～3个月时减弱，但是多数姿势性反射并不减弱，反而变成更复杂的成熟的动作行为。","For instance the asymmetrical tonic neck reflex (ATNR) declines at around 2 or 3 months of age.However, most postural reflexes do not decline, instead becoming integrated into mature motor behaviours."
8059,我能大量地接触并学习他们的锻炼哲学真是非常幸运。,"I was lucky enough to learn a huge amount about their training philosophies, too."
8059,比如，乔就强调了这样一个事实：过去很多人都是用自身体重训练来真正强壮体魄的。,"For example, Joe emphasized the fact that a lot of the old-timers focused on bodyweight training to get really strong."
8059,当然，为了展示力量，他们也要借助外物——如钉和铁桶，但大多数时候，他们都是通过控制自己的身体来增强自身的力量。,"They might have demonstrated their power by unleashing it on external objects like nails and barrels, but in many cases they actually built that basic strength through control of the body."
8060,更糟的是，如果一部分细菌或是病毒看起来与你的身体里的其他部分，比如心脏细胞，只有一点点不同，那么你的身体就有可能在杀死入侵者的同时也对你身体里那些酷似入侵细胞的正常细胞也发起攻击。也就是，你自身的免疫系统实际上开始攻击你的身体，并摧毀你的心脏细胞。,"Even worse is when a portion of the bacteria or virus looks just a little different from something else in your body—say, heart cells.Your body may kill the invader but may also initiate an attack on the normal tissues of your body that simply look like the invader cells—that is, your own immune system may actually start attacking your own body and destroy your own heart cells."
8060,这种出于好意却很危险的逬攻称作自体免疫反应。,This dangerous friendly fire is called an autoimmune response.
8061,毫无疑问，大部分有关术语的讨论都是围绕着自我概念和自尊进行的。,"Undoubtedly, most discussion regarding terminology has revolved around the two terms self-concept and self-esteem."
8061,这两个术语的含义以及它们之间的联系，一直是人们争论的焦点。,"The meaning of the two terms and how they are related continues to be the focus of considerable debate (Berger & Mclnman, 1993)."
8061,传统上认为自我概念与自我描述有关，而自尊则与自我评价相联系。,"Traditionally, self-concept has been aligned with self-description, while self-esteem has been identified with the process of self-evaluation (Weiss, 1987; Fox, 1988)."
8062,我们再看一下在运动员时间知觉的其他方面上，自我决定论和潜意识大脑行动这两个进退两难的问题。,We see this quandary of self-determinism versus the actions of the subconscious brain in other aspects of time perception in athletes.
8062,第一章在讨论长跑运动员的速度策略时，概述了一个同样的形而上学的难题。,Chapter 1 outlines a similar metaphysical muddle in discussing pacing strategies for long-distance runners.
8062,正如在传统上认为的，运动员从起跑线就自己选择了合适的步速，而这个步速会在疲劳到来之前，刚好把他带到10km跑的终点线吗？,"As has been traditionally supposed, does the runner select, from the start, the proper pace that will deliver him to the finish line of a 10K race just before marked fatigue ensues?"
8062,自我决定论会控制吗？,Does self-determinism rule?
8063,毫无疑问，大部分有关术语的讨论都是围绕着自我概念和自尊进行的。,"Undoubtedly, most discussion regarding terminology has revolved around the two terms self-concept and self-esteem."
8063,这两个术语的含义以及它们之间的联系，一直是人们争论的焦点。,"The meaning of the two terms and how they are related continues to be the focus of considerable debate (Berger & Mclnman, 1993)."
8063,传统上认为自我概念与自我描述有关，而自尊则与自我评价相联系。,"Traditionally, self-concept has been aligned with self-description, while self-esteem has been identified with the process of self-evaluation (Weiss, 1987; Fox, 1988)."
8064,关注一下氧化过程是如何发生也是十分重要的。,It's also important to note how the oxidation process occurs.
8064,在许多方面，氧化是你体内一种良性的、目然发生的过程。,"In many ways, oxidation is a good, naturally occurring process in your body."
8064,你的身体需要氧化使你的免疫系统工作起来，并让你的身体能保护自身。,"Your body needs oxidation for your immune system to work, for your body to protect itself."
8064,氧化还能帮助清除掉老的细胞，为新的细胞腾出地方。,It helps kill off old cells to make room for new ones.
8064,所以，氧化不是坏事，但是却有变坏的潜能。,"So it's not a bad thing, but it has the potential to be bad."
8064,癌症是受到了一定扭曲的正常生理过程的一部分。,Cancer is part of the normal biological process that has gone a little awry.
8064,"当氧化成为坏事，也就是身体里的氧化过度 (即身体生了锈），氧化所产生的物质自由基就会损坏DNA,造成恶性细胞的产生，或者阻止清除你体内癌细胞的生理反应。","When oxidation turns bad, there's too much of it (your body's version of rusting); its products—free radicals—damage the DNA to cause malignant cells or inhibit the mechanism that can clear cancer cells from your body."
8065,许多人认为其中的有效成分，即造成这一惊人数字的成分，是番茄红素。这是一种类胡萝卜素，因其抗氧化机能而著名。,"Many believe that the active ingredient—the ingredient responsible for such astounding numbers is lycopene, a carotenoid known for its antioxidant properties."
8065,类胡萝卜素通过黏附在自由基（自由基会引起癌症）上，把它们聚集打包，好让它们集体被清理出身体，不再危害细胞和染色体而发挥其作用。,Carotenoids work by attaching to free radicals (which can be cancer-causing) and packaging them so they can be washed out of the body so they don't damage cells or chromosomes.
8066,壁厚的子宮比举重运动员的二头肌还大，可以形象地说，子宫这时就会吸住阴茎，最终将精子拉逬房间等待与卵子结合。,"The thick walled uterus, which is actually larger than a weight lifter's bicep, literally sucks on the penis and ultimately pulls the sperm into its chamber for fertilization."
8066,此刻，只要精子一鼓作气冲到终点，就能最先与卵子结合。,"At that point, it's a dash to the finish to see which sperm cell can fertilize the egg first."
8066,如果结合成功，受精卵会嵌入一处子宫壁，着床生长。,"If one does, the fertilized egg reaches an area of the uterine wall (womb) where it gets planted."
8067,通过子宫颈涂片检查，我们能够在疾病发病早期就发现HPV和子宮颈癌。,HPV and cervical cancer can be detected early with a Pap smear.
8067,（女性在性成熟后，都应该定期接受子宫颈涂片检查和骨盆检查。没有发现HPV的女性应当一年检查一次，曾经因患HPV接受过治疗的女性则应当每隔半年检查一次。,"(Pap smears and pelvic exams should be regular after a woman becomes sexually active. That should include once a year for women with no signs of HPV and every six months for women whove had MPV treated,)"
8067,）有些HPV种类的发病似乎是毫无理由的。女性中超过50%的人有在初次性接触时染上HPV的可能。,"While some forms of HPV seem to occur for no reason, more than 50 percent of all women have a chance of acquiring HPV with their first sexual encounter."
8068,纵跳。,Vertical jumping.
8068,自从马雷早期记录了充气测力台纵跳时（图36.2）同步的力和位移之后，众多的作者建立了纵跳的各种方案。,"Since the early work of E.J. Marey who recorded the simultaneous measurement of force (pneumatic force platform) and displacement during a vertical jump (Fig. 36.2), numerous authors developed vertical jump protocols."
8068,今天，复杂的仪器（测力台）可以记录下地面的反作用力和身体重心的加速度。,"Today, sophisticated instrumentation (force platform) allows the recording of the ground reaction forces and acceleration of the body centre of mass."
8068,最大功率输出可以从受试者对测力台产生的瞬间用力和身体重心加速度推算出来。,
8069,"纵向研究( longitudinal studies) 可说具有相当的影响力,因为纵向研究主要是长时间地研究同一群研究对象在行为或兴趣上的改变状况 。所以 ,这种类型的研究也非常耗费时间。",Longitudinal studies are powerful because the changes in behavior across the time span of interest are seen in the same people.
8069,"举例来说,之前说过当要去比较同一群分别为6岁、8岁及10岁儿童的垂直跳表现,很明显地就需要5年的时间来完成这个研究,而这种需要长时间研究的类型对于硕士学生来说,可能就不是一个聪明的选择。","Longitudinal designs, however, are time-consuming.A longitudinal study of children’s jumping performances at ages 6, 8, and 10 obviously requires 5 years to complete.That choice of design is probably not wise for a master’s thesis."
8070,若要获得线性关系中近似常态的样本分配，最佳的方法是将相关系数转换成Z值。,The most satisfactory method of approximating normality of a sampling distribution of linear relationships is by transforming coefficients of correlation to Z values.
8070,此方法通称为费雪尔Z转换。,This is often called the Fisher Z transformation.
8070,(请注意，此Z不应该与用来表示常态曲线纵坐标高度的z搞混 。）,(This Z should not be confused with the z used to refer to the height of the ordinate in the area of the normal curve.)
8071,"米切利与爱尔兰（Micheli & Ireland, 1987)曾报道，足球、篮球和体操是跟骨牵拉性骨突炎发病率最高的运动项目。","Micheli and Ireland (1987) reported that soccer, basketball and gymnastics were the sports most likely to present the disease."
8071,"一项针对85名儿童的研究发现，足背伸无力和跟腱挛缩是跟骨牵拉性骨突炎最常见的临床表现症状，在跑步减速期和跳跃落地时症状会加重（Warner & Micheli,1991)。","Dorsiflexion weakness and heel cord contracture were the most common conditions affecting the group of 85 children studied.Symptoms are particularly aggravated during the deceleration portion of a run or landing from a jump (Warner & Micheli, 1991)."
8071,此症在生长突增期更常见，并能导致跟腱紧张。,The condition is more likely to be found during a growth spurt which results in a tightened heel cord.
8071,足过度旋前与跟骨牵拉性骨突炎也有关。,Foot overpronation is also associated with Sever's disease.
8072,,"When a test is given twice, the scores on the first test are correlated with the scores on the second test to determine their degree of consistency."
8072,此时，两个测验分数是对应同一个变数，因而使用组间相关是不正确的。,"Here, the two test scores are for the same variable, so interclass correlation should not be used."
8072,应该使用组内相关 （intraclass correlation)才是正确的统计方法。,"Rather, intraclass correlation is the appropriate statistical technique."
8072,可采用变异数分析(ANOVA)来取得信度系数。,This method uses ANOVA to obtain the reliability coefficient.
8073,除了要研究青春期运动能力快速增长的发展时间之外，更重要的是还要观察运 动能力快速增长与最大身高增长速度出现的时间关系，即与生物学尺度的关系，而不是与 日历年龄的关系。,"In addition to documenting the occurrence of adolescent spurts in performance, the timing of the spurts is ordinarily viewed relative to the timing of peak height velocity (PHV), i.e.relative to a biological milestone, rather than to CA."
8073,这样，可以大大缩短沿日历年龄轴的时间跨度，能更准确获取青春期运动能力快速增长的时间和幅度方面的信息。,"By doing so, the time spread along the CA axis is reduced considerably and better information is obtained about the timing and magnitude of adolescent spurts in performance."
8073,鲍斯首次实现了这种想法。,This concept was first realized by Boas (1892).
8074,最大有氧能力运动员利用氧的能力对有氧耐力运动是非常关键的。,Maximal aerobic power The athlete’s ability to utilize oxygen is critical to aerobic endurance performance.
8074,正如在实验室运动测试中测试的结果，V02max是一系列与氧运输和氧摄取有关的生理因素的复合表达。,"As measured during laboratory exercise testing, the maximal aerobic power (VO2max) is a composite expression of a myriad of physiological factors that define oxygen transport and uptake."
8074,每一个因素都有其自身内在的生物节律。,Each has its own intrinsic biological rhythm.
8075,"男性还可以考虑服用2克左旋精氨酸（L-arginine )，南瓜子和下文提到的其他食物里含有这沖氨基酸。另外还可补充左旋瓜氨酸（L-citrulline ),每天两次，每次500毫克。","Men might also consider taking 2 grams of L-arginine, an amino acid found in pumpkin seed and other foods listed below, and 500 milligrams of L-citrulline twice a day."
8075,据说这两样一起服用（我们当然还是希望凋查数据能比传言更有力）会促进动脉内壁产生一氧化氮，进而促逬血液循坏，有效防止勃起功能障碣，同时增加精子数目。,"It's been rumored that taking these together (we wish the data were stronger than rumor) will increase nitric oxide production by the inner layer of your arteries, thus increasing blood flow, which can prevent erectile dysfunction as well as increase sperm count."
8076,坐骨神经经过人体的脊柱下部，直达双脚。突出的椎间盘压迫坐骨神经时，会导致腿疼，这一情况可以帮助我们解释背痛的起因和严重性。,"The sciatic nerve passes from your lower spine to your feet; when a bulging disc compresses it, it causes leg pain, which helps indicate the cause and severity of back pain."
8076,医生不愿意切除突出的椎间盘来使脊柱恢复正常，因为这样附近椎间盘会承担多余的重量，使磨损提前。,Doctors do not like removing a disc and fusing the spine because the extra pressure on surrounding discs can cause premature damage.
8077,在做坐姿屈膝时，坐在椅子或床的边缘，身体略微向后倾斜，双手抓住边沿，两腿伸直，双脚并拢，脚跟距离地面几厘米。,"In the process of knee tucks, sit on the edge of a chair or bed.Lean back a little, grip the edge of the seat with your hands, and straighten your legs.Your feet should be together with the heels raised a few inches from the floor."
8077,这是该动作的起始姿势（图61）。,This is the start position (fig. 61).
8077,平缓地抬起膝盖，直到膝盖距胸部约15一25厘米。,Smoothly bring the knees up and in until they are approximately six to ten inches from your chest.
8077,在此过程中呼气，动作完成时呼气结束，腹肌保持收缩状态。,"Exhale as you draw the knees in.By the time the motion is complete, you should have exhaled fully and your abs should be tightly contracted."
8077,这是该动作的结束姿势（图62）。,This is the finish position(fig. 62).
8077,暂停1秒钟，进行反向运动并回到起始姿势。,Pause for a count of one before reversing the motion and finishing again in the start position.
8077,伸展膝盖的同时吸气。,Inhale as you extend.
8077,双脚应该始终沿着一条直线移动，而且始终保持悬空，直到一组动作完成方可接触地面。,"Your feet should follow a straight line backwards and forwards, and should not touch the floor until the set is completed."
8077,腹部要始终收缩，动作要慢，要抵制快速完成动作的冲动。,Keep the stomach tucked in at all times.Resist the urge to pump out reps quickly.
8077,如果需要，可以在两次动作之间喘几口气（所有中段练习都一样） 。,"As with all waist techniques, take extra breaths between reps if you need to."
8078,随着年龄的增长，表皮制造新细胞开始缓慢。随着时间的推移，阳光的破坏使得活表皮的厚度从20个细胞减至2个。,"As you grow older, your epidermis makes new cells more slowly, and sun damage thins living epidermis from twenty to two cells deep over time."
8078,使你的皮肤年轻的方法之一就是诱导你的皮肤，使它认为需要制造新的细胞。,One of the ways you can help make your skin younger is to trick your skin—to make it think it needs to produce new cells.
8078,用α径基酸（AHA)，—种在许多护肤霜里都含有的物质就可以做到这一点。,"Use glycolic alpha hydroxy acid (AHA), a substance found in many skin creams."
8078,它发挥作用是通过增加皮肤的周期率，即刺激表皮去除死细胞，使皮肤认为它需要更新并制造新细胞，这样就会使皮肤显得更加年轻。,"It works by increasing skin turnover—that is, it irritates your epidermis, removing dead cells, causing your skin to think it needs to rejuvenate and produce new cells, which has the effect of making your skin look younger."
8079,补充锯齿蒲葵已被证实能减少患前列腺肥大的可能。,The supplement saw palmetto has been shown to decrease the risk that benign prostatic hypertrophy will wake you up at night.
8079,不过在选购锯齿蒲葵制品时，你需要先看看它是否含有β-谷甾醇（betasitosterol)与消除肿大有关的物质。,"But when you look for it, you need to check for ones with the ingredient beta sitosterol—the substance that's correlated with decreased swelling."
8079,市场上50%的锯齿蒲葵产品其实并不含β-谷甾醇。,Half of the saw palmetto products on the market don't contain any.
8079,每天两次，每次补充160毫克锯齿蒲葵。,Take 160 milligrams twice a day.
8080,这是桥系列的最终式，它需要不可思议的柔韧性、强大的关节、强有力的肌肉以及极好的平衡能力和协调能力。,"This is the ultimate bridging technique of the series.It requires incredible flexibility, strong joints, powerful muscles, balance and coordination."
8080,经常练习铁板桥，可以增强敏捷性、按摩内部器官，调整脊椎和肌肉系统，让你精力充沛。,"When performed regularly, stand-to-stand bridges increase agility, massage the internal organs, align the spine and muscular system and increase energy."
8080,达到高次数练习后，它还会为你的新陈代谢“加油”。,"When worked for high repetitions, they supercharge the metabolism."
8081,本章提供了研究方法的综观，其主要部分包括参与者、研究工具或设备、实验步骡，以及实验设计与分析。,"This chapter provided an overview of the method for the research study.We identified the major parts as participants, instruments or apparatuses, procedures, and design and analysis."
8081,研究方法中的四个部分以及它们的主要目的在于排除对立假设或虚无假设，并排除研究结果的任何解释，除了研究者想要探讨的假设之外。,The major purposes of the four parts of the methods section are to eliminate alternative or rival hypotheses and to eliminate any explanation for the results except the hypothesis that the researcher intends to evaluate.
8081,MAXICON 原则点出了达成的方法：(a)最大化真正的或者是设计的变异数来源；（b )最小化任何的误差或者是非设计的变异数来源，以及(c)控制任何的外在变异数来源。,"The MAXICON principle shows the way to accomplish this:(a) Maximize the true or planned sources of variation,(b) minimize any error or unplanned sources of variation, and(c) control any extraneous sources of variation."
8081,在后面的章节里，我们将从统计、测量( 第二部分）与实验设计（第三部分） 的观点来描述如何达成这些原则。,"In later chapters, we detail how to do this from the viewpoints of statistics and measurement (part II) and of design (part III)."
8081,我们会在第四部分中描述论文的最后段落。,We explain the final sections of the thesis or dissertation in part IV.
8082,在有氧耐力训练中也获得了同样的结果。,The same thing is observed with aerobic endurance training.
8082,如果让60岁的人加入规律性的散步或者跑步项目中，他们的V02max会增加20%~30%。,"If  you put sexagenarians into a regular walking or running program, their maximal oxygen uptake increases by 20 to 30%."
8082,在肌肉氧化能力上也可以观察到相同的增长幅度，这个增长幅度与进行相同锻炼的年轻人是一样的。,You’ll also see the same magnitude of increases in muscle oxidative capacity that young adults experience under the same regimen.
8083,V字举腿在健身房里极为罕见。,V raises are very rarely seen in gyms.
8083,除了偶尔有一些武术家表演过V字举腿（李小龙的最爱之一），通常只有高手级的体操运动员才能做到这种动作。,You might witness the occasional expert martial artist performing them—they were a favorite of Bruce Lee—but they are usually the province of advanced gymnasts.
8083,它需要训练者经过数年、认真的、循序渐进的身体中段训练，尤其要专心于最难、最有成效的技巧，方可培养出做该动作所需的肌肉力量、神经力量、协调力与柔韧性。,"They require a level of muscular strength, nervous power, coordination and flexibility that can only be cultivated through years of serious, progressive midsection work, specializing in only the hardest, most productive training techniques."
8084,z分数是最基本的标准分数。,The basic standard score is the z score.
8084,z分数将原始分数转换为标准差单位，以平均数为0，每个标准差为1.0。,The z score converts raw scores to units of standard deviation in which the mean is zero and a standard deviation is 1.
8084,公式如下：z=(X-M) /s。,0.The formula is z=(X-M) /s.
8084,假设垂直跳高的平均数与标准差分别为40公分与6公分，伏地挺身的平均数与标准差为20次与5次。,"Suppose the mean and standard deviation for vertical-jump scores are 40 cm and 6 cm, respectively, and for push-ups they are 20 and 5, respectively."
8085,并非所有的失忆都是由阿尔茨海默病引起的。有些失忆可能由血管问题引起，或者是因为神经细胞丧失功能。,Alzheimer's is not to blame for all memory loss; some can be caused by vascular problems or a loss of neuron function.
8085,下面介绍一个快速自我诊断的检测方法，它可以发现阿尔茨海默病的前期症状。,Here's a quick self-diagnostic test to help detect the first signs of Alzheimer's.
8085,让你的爷爷记住一个七位数的电话号码。,Give Gramps a seven-digit phone number to remember.
8085,有失忆问题的人可能很难在短时间内记住所有的数字，不过测试还没完。,"People with any kind of memory loss may have trouble remembering the whole thing immediately, but that's not the test."
8085,5分钟后，阿尔茨海默病患者和其他类型的失忆患者可能记得4个数字。,"After five minutes, both an individual with Alzheimer's and someone with another type of memory loss may remember zero to four numbers."
8085,这时，再给两个人包括原来的电话号码在内的三组不同号码。阿尔茨海默病患者不会分辨出哪一组号码原先看过，而其他类型的失忆患者则能分辨出来。,"But you give both three different phone numbers, including the original, the person with Alzheimer's won't recognize the original phone number, while others will."
